https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-email-asks-is-this-what-broke-looks-like/	Clinton Email Asks, “Is This What Broke Looks Like”	 Fiction!				2015/03/13	" This What BROKE Looks Like
Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a US Senator from New York State, comes under the “congressional retirement plan” which means that she STILL receives her Congressional salary until she dies.
If Bill out-lives her, he then inherits HER salary until he dies. He is already getting his Presidential retirement ($20,000 a month) until he dies. If Hillary out-lives Bill, she also gets HIS salary until she dies, Guess who pays for that? WE DO!
Clinton’s 20 Acre – $11 million mansion is common knowledge. For her to establish NY residency to run for the Senate, they purchased this mansion in upscale Chappaqua, New York ….makes sense. They are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. Still makes sense.
Here is where it becomes interesting. Their mortgage payments are around $10,000/month. But an extra residence had to be built and paid for by the federal government on the acreage to house the Secret Service Agents. Any improvement to the property is owned by the property owners…the Clinton ‘s.
So….the Clinton’s charge the federal government $10,000 monthly rent for the use of the extra residence to house the Secret Service staff which is just about equal to their mortgage payment.
This means that we, the taxpayers, pay the Clinton’s, salary, mortgage, transportation, safety and security as well as the salaries for their 12 man staff and it is all perfectly legal.
AND DON’T FORGET HIS GOVERNOR’S PENSION AND HER SECRETARY OF STATE PENSION…..
When she runs for President, will you vote for her?
How many people will YOU send this to?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/air-force-academy-thunderbirds/	President Obama Delayed Thunderbirds Air Show Following Air Force Academy Graduation	 Fiction!				2015/03/09	"From an Academy grad – 204 missions over North Vietnam in an F-4
…………………………………………………………………………………………………..
I just wanted to pass on a little info in case some of you were not aware of this. Yesterday was the Air force Academy graduation ceremony. My friend from Texas had just arrived and we drove down the road to watch the Thunderbirds air show after the ceremony was finished. Most of you know Pres. Obama spoke at the ceremony and handed out the diploma’s. When this finished it was time for the Thunderbirds to fly. There was one maneuver then they disappeared.
A man standing by me called a friend at Peterson Field and found out that the air show was halted because Obama wanted to leave. A helicopter soon appeared and flew around in a circular pattern above where we were – basically doing reconnaissance as Obama’s motor-cade was exiting the Air Force Academy. He was going to Denver to do some more campaigning since Colorado is a swing state. After he left the Thunderbirds came back and continued the show for the graduates.
Think about this . Obama comes to a graduation, speaks etc. then decides to leave before the Thunderbirds can complete their air show. They had to fly around, & waste fuel. Thousands of people – the graduating cadets, parents, friends, observers in the vicinity parked in lots waiting to see them fly, inconvenienced , so Obama – his “highness’ could leave to go campaign in Denver! How disrespectful of EVERYONE in attendance.
It would have taken only about 20-30 minutes more time to stay until the fly-over was finished thereby honoring the graduates, Thunderbirds and the military in general. However, this narcissistic disgrace of a ‘Commander -in-Chief” had to inconvenience everyone and leave interrupting the ceremony fly-over because everything is about him. I was disgusted by this and so was everyone else standing around near us. I hope this info gets passed on so others can learn how disrespectful this Pres. is toward the military. Not too many who witnessed this will be voting for him.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/american-no-abilities-act/	Congress Has Passed The American With No Abilities Act	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Happy New Year Y’all!!! 








The Americans With No Abilities Act 
President Barack Obama and the Democratic Senate are considering sweeping legislation that will provide new benefits for many Americans. The Americans With No Abilities Act is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition. 
 “Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,” said California Sen. Barbara Boxer. “We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing.”
In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent). 
 Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. 
Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability (POI) into middle-management positions, and give a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires. 
Finally, the Americans With No Abilities Act contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, “Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?” 
“As a non-abled person, I can ‘t be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,” said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, Mich., due to her inability to remember righty tighty, lefty loosey. “This new law should be real good for people like me. I値l finally have job security.” With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. 
Said Sen. Dick Durbin: “As a senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so.”

My husband and his friends were threatened to be arrested and were told they would be booked under federal charges if they did anything. I am sending this to you so that you in turn can start emailing it to every one on your list. It is totally uncalled for and people need to see it.

Homeland Security was designed to identify and defend America from Terrorist acts yet yesterday it let illegal and legal citizens of this country desecrate the Flag. People were spitting on it, stomping on it and burning it with cigarettes. One soldier who had just returned from Iraq tried to grab the flag and was thrown to the ground by the Capitol Police and Homeland Security.

This picture is of 39 men that were ordered to be executed by Abraham Lincoln for treaty violations (hunting off of their assigned reservation)Yes the “Great Emancipator” as the history books so fondly referred to him as. Authorities in Minnesota asked President Lincoln to order the immediate execution of all 303 Indian males found guilty. Lincoln was concerned with how this would play with the Europeans, whom he was afraid were about to enter the war on the side of the South. He offered the following compromise to the politicians of Minnesota: They would pare the list of those to be hung down to 39. In return, Lincoln promised to kill or remove every Indian from the state and provide Minnesota with 2 million dollars in federal funds. So, on December 26, 1862, the “Great Emancipator” ordered the largest mass execution in American History, where the guilt of those to be executed was entirely in doubt. Regardless of how Lincoln defenders seek to play this, it was nothing more than murder to obtain the land of the Santee Sioux and to appease his political cronies in Minnesota. You have no idea the things that are hidden from you with the textbooks assigned to you as a child by your government. Stay mindful people, be aware….in the age of information being ignorant is indeed a choice. Goodnight everyone

https://www.truthorfiction.com/presidentialiq/	The Estimated IQ’s of American Presidents	Fiction!				2015/03/16	"
The Intelligence of our Presidents
Bakersville News Service 6-28-01 12:32 PM CST
by Jennifer L. Borenstein
The intelligence of our presidents has never been seriously scrutinized at any time in our history until now. There is a widespread perception that President G. W. Bush is not qualified for the position he holds. That increasing awareness by the people has led to a study of the intellectual ability of all presidents for the past fifty years.
There have been twelve presidents in that time, from F. D. Roosevelt to G. W. Bush. All were rated based on scholarly achievements, writings that they alone wrote, their ability to speak effectively, and a number of psychological factors.
The conclusions of the study, conducted by an independent think tank located in Scranton, Pennsylvania were surprising. This think tank includes high caliber historians, psychiatrists, sociologists, scientists in human behavior, and psychologists. Among their ranks are Dr. Werner Levenstein, world-renowned sociologist, and Professor Patricia A. Williams, a world-respected psychiatrist. All members of the think tank are experts at being able to detect a person’s IQ from the criteria stated earlier.
After four months of research, these learned men and women have determined the IQs of each president within a range of five percentage points. The IQs listed below are the norms for each president.
147 Franklin D. Roosevelt (D)
132 Harry Truman (D)
122 Dwight D. Eisenhower (R)
174 John F. Kennedy (D)
126 Lyndon B. Johnson (D)
155 Richard M. Nixon (R)
121 Gerald Ford (R)
175 James E. Carter (D)
105 Ronald Reagan (R)
099 George HW Bush (R)
182 William J. Clinton (D)
091 George W. Bush (R)
The non-partisan researchers who evaluated the twelve presidents determined that the six Republican presidents for the past 50 years had an average IQ of 115.5, with President Nixon having the highest IQ, at 155.
President G. W. Bush was rated the lowest of all the Republicans with an IQ of 91.
The six Democrat presidents had IQs with an average of 156, with President Clinton having the highest IQ, at 182. President Lyndon B. Johnson was rated the lowest of all the Democrats with an IQ of 126. The margin of error is plus or minus five percent.
This study was initiated on February 13, 2001 and completed on June 17, 2001.
This study validated the widespread feeling of people about the sitting president. President Bush was rated low because of his inability to command the English language, his lack of any scholarly achievements, and an absence of anything authored by him that would reflect an intellectual effort.

The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription: “Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times.

His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an

https://www.truthorfiction.com/bushancestor/	"Summary of eRumor:
This email claims that Laura Bush, the wife of President George W. Bush, is into genealogy and discovered a greatgreat uncle in the Bush family who was hanged for stealing horses. When the president’s imagemakers were finished with the story, however, they had made the history of the great"	"great uncle sound like one about a terrific citizen and send it to the Associated Press.
The Truth:
This is not true just like it was not true about Al Gore or Hillary Rodham Clinton. The essence of this story is from an old piece of humorous writing that was designed to demonstrate how you can put “spin” on a negative story to make it sound positive. Someone altered the story to make it seem as though it was talking about an ancestor of Al Gore. Then another version got started saying it was about an ancestor of Bill Clinton. Now this version is making the rounds saying it is about George W. Bush. It also adds a new feature. The alleged relative’s name is “Chad” and is called the first “hanging chad,” a reference to the controversy over ballots in Florida from the 2000 presidential election."				2015/03/16	"Subject: Little bit of history

https://www.truthorfiction.com/blackwell/	Ken Blackwell Commentary on Barack Obama	Truth!				2015/03/17	"  No matter what party you are –this is a must read 
 Something to think about, an article by a Black Columnist. 
Ken Blackwell – Columnist for the New York Sun It’s an amazing time to be alive in America. We’re in a year of firsts in this presidential election: the first viable woman candidate; the first viable African-American candidate; and, a candidate who is the first frontrunning freedom fighter over 70. The next president of America will be a first.
We won’t truly be in an election of firsts, however, until we judge every candidate by where they stand. We won’t arrive where we should be until we no longer talk about skin color or gender.
Now that Barack Obama steps to the front of the Democratic field, we need to stop talking about his race, and start talking about his policies and his politics.
The reality is this: Though the Democrats will not have a nominee until August, unless Hillary Clinton drops out, Mr. Obama is now the frontrunner, and its time America takes a closer and deeper look at him.
Some pundits are calling him the next John F. Kennedy. He’s not. He’s the next George McGovern. And it’s time people learned the facts. Because the truth is that Mr. Obama is the single most liberal senator in the entire U.S. Senate. He is more liberal than Ted Kennedy, Bernie Sanders, or Mrs. Clinton.
Never in my life have I seen a presidential frontrunner whose rhetoric is so far removed from his record. Walter Mondale promised to raise our taxes, and he lost. George McGovern promised military weakness, and he lost. Michael Dukakis promised a liberal domestic agenda, and he lost. Yet Mr. Obama is promising all those things, and he’s not behind in the polls. Why? Because the press has dealt with him as if he were in a beauty pageant. Mr. Obama talks about getting past party, getting past red and blue, to lead the United States of America. But let’s look at the more defined strokes of who he is underneath this superficial ‘beauty.’
Start with national security, since the president’s most important duties are as commander-in-chief. Over the summer, Mr. Obama talked about invading Pakistan, a nation armed with nuclear weapons; meeting without preconditions with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who vows to destroy Israel and create another Holocaust; and Kim Jong II, who is murdering and starving his people, but emphasized that the nuclear option was off the table against terrorists – something no president has ever taken off the table since we created nuclear weapons in the 1940s. Even Democrats who have worked in national security condemned all of those remarks. Mr. Obama is a foreign-policy novice who would put our national security at risk.
Next, consider economic policy. For all its faults, our health care system is the strongest in the world. And free trade agreements, created by Bill Clinton as well as President Bush, have made more goods more affordable so that even people of modest means can live a life that no one imagined a generation ago. Yet Mr. Obama promises to raise taxes on ‘the rich.’ How to fix Social Security? Raise taxes. How to fix Medicare? Raise taxes. Prescription drugs? Raise taxes. Free college? Raise taxes. Socialize medicine? Raise taxes. His solution to everything is to have government take it over. Big Brother on steroids, funded by your paycheck.
Finally, look at the social issues. Mr. Obama had the audacity to open a stadium rally by saying, ‘All praise and glory to God!’ but says that Christian leaders speaking for life and marriage have ‘hijacked’ – hijacked – Christianity. He is pro-partial birth abortion, and pr omises to appoint Supreme Court justices who will rule any restriction on it unconstitutional. He espouses the abortion views of Margaret Sanger, one of the early advocates of racial cleansing. His spiritual leaders endorse homosexual marriage, and he is moving in that direction. In Illinois, he refused to vote against a statewide ban – ban – on all handguns in the state. These are radical left, Hollywood, and Sa n Francisco values, not Middle America values.
The real Mr. Obama is an easy target for the general election. Mrs. Clinton is a far tougher opponent. But Mr. Obama could win if people don’t start looking behind his veneer and flowery speeches. His vision of ‘bringing America together’ means saying that those who disagree with his agenda for America are hijackers or warmongers. Uniting the country means adopting his liberal agenda and abandon ing any conflicting beliefs.
But right now everyone is talking about how eloquent of a speaker he is and – yes – they’re talking about his race. Those should never be the factors on which we base our choice for president. Mr. Obama’s radical agenda sets him far outside the American mainstream, to the left of Mrs. Clinton. It’s time to talk about the real Barack Obama. In an election of firsts, let’s first make sure we elect the person who is qualified to be our president in a nuclear age during a global civilizational war.

Version 1:
Sent to me by a friend who lives in Arizona.
We, in Arizona, know you’re boycotting us — but you really should come out here and see our beautiful Sonoran Desert. It’s just gorgeous right now!  We know you’d love it and maybe you can share what you saw with the rest of the country so they can love it too!
This is on an ‘illegal super – highway’ from Mexico to the USA (Tucson) used by human smugglers. This area is located in a wash, approximately 1.5 miles long, just south of Tucson, Arizona. If a flood came, all this would be washed to the river and then onto the sea!
It is estimated over 5,000 discarded backpacks are in this wash. Countless water containers, food wrappers, clothing, feces, including thousands of soiled baby diapers. And as you can see in this picture, fresh footprints leading right into it.
As we kept walking down the wash, we thought for sure it was going to end, but around every corner was more and more trash!
And of course the trail leading out of the wash in our city, heads directly NORTH to Tucson, then leads to your town tomorrow.
They’ve already come through here. Isn’t Arizona just beautiful, America?
Why would you boycott us???
Our desert has basically been turned into a landfill.
The trash left behind by people illegally crossing our border is another Environmental Disaster to hit the USA.
If these actions had been done in Yosemite, one of our Northwest Forests or Seashore National Parks areas, there would be an uprising of the American people…..but this is the Arizona-Mexican border. You won’t see these pictures on CNN, ABC, NBC or the New York Times newspaper. Nor will they mention the disease that comes from the uncovered human waste left in our desert. However, with respect to national media, they do offer us “Special Reports” on cheating celebrity spouses….
This information needs to be seen by the rest of the country.
Version2:
Pictures Of Our Beautiful Sonoran Desert in Ariz.
HERE IS A REAL EYE OPENER FOR YOU.
Another Monster Layup/Rest Area Discovered by CDC ARIZONA SEARCH & RESCUE
We breathed a sigh of relief the day the Senate defeated the Amnesty Bill, but the USA is still being invaded! We discovered one of the biggest layups we have ever found.
This layup is on an ‘illegal super – highway’ from Mexico to the USA (Tucson) used by human smugglers.
This layup area is located in a wash area approximately .5 of a mile long just south of Tucson.
We estimate there are over 3000 discarded back packs in this layup area. Countless water containers, food wrappers, clothing, and soiled baby diapers. And as you can see in this picture, fresh footprints leading right into it. We weren’t too far behind them.
As I kept walking down the wash, I was sure it was going to end just ahead, but I kept walking and walking, and around every corner was more and more trash!
And of course the trail leading out of the layup area heading NORTH to Tucson, then on to your town tomorrow.
They’ve already come through here. Is this America the Beautiful ?
Or another landfill?
The trash left behind by the illegals is another of the Environmental Disasters to hit the USA. Had this been done in one of our great Northwest Forests or Seashore National Parks areas there would be an uprising of the American people……..but this is remote Arizona-Mexican border. You won’t see these pictures on CNN, ABC, NBC or the Arizona Repugnant. Nor will they mention the disease that comes from the human waste left in the desert. They do talk about light bulbs a lot though…

https://www.truthorfiction.com/aclu-lewis/	Progressive Insurance Chairman Peter Lewis Donates Millions to Liberal Causes	 Truth! & Outdated! 				2015/03/17	" Flo and her Boss
 Stephanie Courtney, the actress who plays “Flo,” gets $500,000 per year.
 AND HER BOSS!!!!!
                         In case you didn’t know…..
 “Harley Owners Group”, the biggest motorcycle club in America, maybe even the world, hasn’t found any members that have Progressive Insurance since the word got out about Progressive’s communist affiliations. Their association with George Soros, alone, should bring chills up your back.  Oh, you don’t know who George Soros is?  He finances the Obama progressive affiliations. 
 Progressive  Insurance….Who are they?  You’ve seen and probably smiled at the clever Progressive Insurance TV commercials. Well, you’re about to learn the rest of the story.
 PROGRESSIVE  AUTO INSURANCE 
 You know their TV commercials, the ones featuring the ditsy actress all dressed in white. What you might not know is that the Chairman of Progressive is Peter Lewis, one of the major funders of leftist causes in America .
 Between 2001 and 2003, Lewis funneled $15 million to the ACLU, the group most responsible for destroying what’s left of America ’s Judeo-Christian heritage.
 Lewis  also gave $12.5 million  toMoveOn.org    http://moveon.org/ and America  Coming Together, two key propaganda arms of the socialist  left.
 His funding for these groups was conditional on matching contributions from George Soros, the America-hating socialist who is the chief financier of the Obama political machine. 
 Lewis made a fortune as a result of capitalism, but now finances a progressive move me nt that threatens to destroy the American  free enterprise system. His group is targeting television shows on Fox News.
 Peter Lewis is making a fortune off of conservative Americans (who buy his auto insurance), then he uses
 that money to dismantle the very system that made him wealthy. He’s banking on no one finding out who he is, so STOP buying Progressive Insurance and pass this information on to all your friends. Chairman Lewis’ gift helps the ACLU promote their anti-Christmas agenda such as:
 §  Removing nativity scenes from public property
 §  Banning songs such as Silent Night from schools
 §  Refusing to  allow students to write about the Christian aspect of Christmas in school projects
 §  Renaming Christmas break Winter break
 §  Refusing to allow a city sponsored Christmas parade to be called a Christmas parade
 §  Not allowing a Christmas tree in a public school
 §  Renaming a Christmas tree displayed on public property a Holiday tree. In addition to their war on Christmas, the ACLU uses gifts like that from Chairman Lewis to:
 §  Sue states to force them to legalize homosexual marriage
 §  Force libraries to remove porn filters from their computers
 §  Sue the Boy Scouts to force them to accept homosexuals as scout leaders
 §  Help legalize child pornography
 §  Legalize live sex acts in bars in Oregon
 §  Protect the North American Man Boy Love Association whose motto is “sex by eight or it is too late”
 §  Censor student-led prayer at graduation
 §  Remove “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance
 §  Remove “In God We Trust” on our currency
  
  Another example of the eRumor as it appeared online:
 Did anyone know about these actions?
 This is a heads up regarding Progressive Auto Insurance. You know who they are. They’re the ones with the clever television ads featuring the perky brunette actress, Flo, all dressed in white. What you might not know is that the chairman of Progressive is Peter Lewis, one of the largest funders of the left in America .. He’s your typical rich spoiled kid who took over the company from his father and apparently feels guilty for his success and now dedicates himself to making It impossible for anyone else to become wealthy.
 Between 2001 and 2003, Lewis funneled $15 million to the ACLU, the group most responsible for destroying what’s left of America’s Judeo-Christian heritage. Indeed, Lewis is himself an ACLU member. One of the ACLU projects he earmarked his funds for was an effort to sue school districts who have drug testing policies. In other words, this idiot wants teachers to be ab
le to use drugs without fear of exposure. I wonder what he would think if all his own employees came to work drugged out every day..
 Lewis also gave $12.5 million to  MoveOn.org and American Coming Together, two key components of the socialist
 left. The former group is perhaps the main group used by the Obama forces to organize their activists; the latter group is a 527 political action group that essentially served as a front for the SEIU union thugs who ran ACORN. His funding for
 these groups was conditional on matching contributions from George Soros, the international socialist who finances much of the Obama political network.
 It’s disturbing that Lewis made a fortune as a result of capitalism But now finances a progressive movement that threatens to destroy The free enterprise system. He reminds me somewhat of Armand Hammer, the former head of Occidental Petroleum who did business with Joseph Stalin and became his good friend, around the same time Stalin was executing businessmen all over the USSR .
 What angers me further is the way this company is targeting television shows watched by conservatives such as Fox News. Peter Lewis is making a fortune off of conservative Americans so that he can destroy our country. He’s banking on no one finding out who he is. I think it’s time we expose this clown.
 Sample of eRumor from 2005:
 Progressive Insurance Chairman Gives $8.5 Million To ACLU
 In one of his recent columns, Chuck Colson relates the following story.
 In a Texas classroom, children were told to draw a tracing of their foot, and then put a message on the drawing. One little girl wrote “Jesus Loves Me” on hers. What happened next shows the abysmal state of religious tolerance in America.
 As Fox news anchor John Gibson relates in his new book, The War on Christmas, the child’s teacher ripped the tracing off the board. “Don’t you ever do this again,” she said. The little girl burst into tears.
 When her outraged father called the school, nervous officials told the child to make another tracing. She did so-but this time, instead of scrawling “Jesus Loves Me,” she drew a tiny cross that was so small it was almost invisible. Behind nearly every such incident you will find the ACLU. According to the New York Times, Peter Lewis, chairman of Progressive Insurance, believes in the mission and work of the ACLU so much that he gave them $8.5 million. (Do an Internet search on “Peter B. Lewis” and “ACLU.” You’ll be shocked by how extensive his support is!)
 Chairman Lewis’ gift helps the ACLU promote their anti-Christmas agenda such as:
 Removing nativity scenes from public property
 Banning songs such as Silent Night from schools
 Refusing to allow students to write about the Christian aspect of Christmas in school projects
 Renaming Christmas break Winter break
 Refusing to allow a city sponsored Christmas parade to be called a Christmas parade
 Not allowing a Christmas tree in a public school
 Renaming a Christmas tree displayed on public property a Holiday tree
 In addition to their war on Christmas, the ACLU uses gifts like that from Chairman Lewis to:
 Sue states to force them to legalize homosexual marriage
 Force libraries to remove porn filters from their computers
 Sue the Boy Scouts to force them to accept homosexuals as scout leaders
 Help legalize child pornography
 Legalize live sex acts in bars in Oregon
 Protect the North American Man Boy Love Association whose motto is “sex by eight or it is too late”
 Censor student led prayer at graduation
 Remove “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance
 Remove “In God We Trust” on our currency
 Recommended action: If you have a Progressive Insurance policy, cancel it. If you don’t have a Progressive policy, let Chairman Lewis know you will not be buying one. (We recommend you do not purchase Allstate Insurance. We will explain our recommendation in a future letter.)
 Click here if you have a Progressive policy
 Click here if you do not have a Progressive policy
 Extremely important! Please forward this to your family and friends. The vast majority of them probably aren’t aware of Chairman Lewis’ gift to the ACLU.
 Thanks for caring enough to get involved.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/acorn-registration-fraud/	Ohio Man Registered To Vote 72 Times By ACORN	 Reported To Be Truth!				2015/03/17	"1 VOTER, 72 REGISTRATIONS ‘ACORN PAID ME IN CASH & CIGS’ By JEANE MacINTOSH Post Correspondent
WHO Do you think they will Vote for? PAWNS IN ‘FRAUD’: Freddie Johnson, yesterday in Cleveland, and Lateala Goins told of filling out voter registrations multiple times in the ACORN scandal revealed by The Post yesterday. 
CLEVELAND – A man at the center of a voter-registration scandal told The Post yesterday he was given cash and cigarettes by aggressive ACORN activists in exchange for registering an astonishing 72 times, in apparent violation of Ohio laws. 
“Sometimes, they come up and bribe me with a cigarette, or they’ll give me a dollar to sign up,” said Freddie Johnson, 19, who filled out 72 separate voter-registration cards over an 18-month period at the behest of the left-leaning Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. 
“The ACORN people are everywhere, looking to sign people up. I tell them I am already registered. The girl said, ‘You are?’ I say, ‘Yup,’ and then they say, ‘Can you just sign up again?’ ” he said. 
Johnson used the same information on all of his registration cards, and officials say they usually catch and toss out duplicate registrations. But the practice sparks fear that some multiple registrants could provide different information and vote more than once by absentee ballot. 
ACORN is under investigation in Ohio and at least eight other states – including Missouri, where the FBI said it’s planning to look into potential voter fraud – for over-the-top efforts to get as many names as possible on the voter rolls regardless of whether a person is registered or eligible. 
It’s even under investigation in Bridgeport, Conn., for allegedly registering a 7-year-old girl to vote, according to the State Elections Enforcement Commission. 
Meanwhile, a federal judge yesterday ordered Ohio’s Secretary of State to verify the identity of newly registered voters by matching them with other government documents. The order was in response to a Republican lawsuit unrelated to the ACORN probe in Cuyahoga County, in which at least three people, including Johnson, have been subpoenaed. 
Bribing citizens with gifts, property  or anything of value is a fourth-degree felony in Ohio, punishable by up to 18 months in prison. And it’s a fifth-degree felony – punishable by 12 months in jail – for a person to pay “compensation on a fee-per-registration” system when signing up someone to vote.  
Johnson, who works at a cellphone kiosk in downtown Cleveland, said he was a sitting duck for the signature hunters, but was always happy to help them out in exchange for a smoke or a little scratch. He’d collected 10 to 20 cigarettes and anywhere from $10 to $15, he said. 
The Cleveland voting probe, first reported by The Post yesterday, also focused on Lateala Goins, who said she put her name on multiple voter registrations. She guessed ACORN canvassers then put fake addresses on them. “You can tell them you’re registered as many times as you want – they do not care,” she said. 
ACORN spokesman Kris Harsh said the group does not tolerate its workers paying people to sign the voter-registration cards. 
ACORN’s political wing has endorsed Barack Obama for president, but Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign in Ohio, said ACORN has no role in its get-out-the-vote drive. 
During the primary season, however, the Obama camp paid another group, Citizen Service Inc., $832,598 for various political services, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. That group and ACORN share the same board of directors.  
In Wisconsin yesterday, John McCain blasted ACORN. 
“No one should be corrupting the most precious right we have, that is the right to vote,” he said. 
It’s a right Johnson will exercise. “Yeah, I’ve registered enough – I might as well vote.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/airtran297/	"A passenger witnessed a ""hijacking dry run"" on AirTran Airways Flight 297 in 2009."	Not True	['airline rumors', 'airtran', 'email forwards']			2015/03/17	"One week ago, I went to Ohio on business and to see my father. On Tuesday, November the 17th, I returned home. If you read the papers the 18th you may have seen a blurb where a AirTran flight was cancelled from Atlanta to Houston due to a man who refused to get off of his cell phone before takeoff. It was on Fox.
I was in 1st class coming home. 11 Muslim men got on the plane in full attire. 2 sat in 1st class and the rest peppered themselves throughout the plane all the way to the back. As the plane taxied to the runway the stewardesses gave the safety spiel we are all so familiar with. At that time, one of the men got on his cell and called one of his companions in the back and proceeded to talk on the phone in Arabic very loudly and very aggressively. This took the 1st stewardess out of the picture for she repeatedly told the man that cell phones were not permitted at the time.. He ignored her as if she was not there.
The 2nd man who answered the phone did the same and this took out the 2nd stewardess. In the back of the plane at this time, 2 younger Muslims, one in the back, isle, and one in front of him, window, began to show footage of a porno they had taped the night before, and were very loud about it. Now they are only permitted to do this prior to Jihad. If a Muslim man goes into a strip club, he has to view the woman via mirror with his back to her. (don’t ask me .I don’t make the rules, but I’ve studied) The 3rd stewardess informed them that they were not to have electronic devices on at this time. To which one of the men said ?shut up infidel dog!? She went to take the camcorder and he began to scream in her face in Arabic. At that exact moment, all 11 of them got up and started to walk the cabin. This is where I had had enough! I got up and started to the back where I heard a voice behind me from another Texan twice my size say I got your back.  I grabbed the man who had been on the phone by the arm and said you WILL go sit down or you Will be thrown from this plane! As I led him around me to take his seat, the fellow Texan grabbed him by the back of his neck and his waist and headed out with him. I then grabbed the 2nd man and said, You WILL do the same! He protested but adrenaline was flowing now and he was going to go. As I escorted him forward the plane doors open and 3 TSA agents and 4 police officers entered. Me and my new Texan friend were told to cease and desist for they had this under control. I was happy to oblige actually. There was some commotion in the back, but within moments, all 11 were escorted off the plane. They then unloaded their luggage.
We talked about the occurrence and were in disbelief that it had happen, when suddenly, the door open again and on walked all 11!! Stone faced, eyes front and robotic (the only way I can describe it). The stewardess from the back had been in tears and when she saw this, she was having NONE of it! Being that I was up front, I heard and saw the whole ordeal. She told the TSA agent there was NO WAY she was staying on the plane with these men. The agent told her they had searched them and were going to go through their luggage with a fine tooth comb and that they were allowed to proceed to Houston . The captain and co-captain came out and told the agent we and our crew will not fly this plane! After a word or two, the entire crew, luggage in tow, left the plane. 5 minutes later, the cabin door opened again and a whole new crew walked on.
Again.. this is where I had had enough!!! I got up and asked What the hell is going on!!?? I was told to take my seat. They were sorry for the delay and I would be home shortly. I said I’m getting off this plane. The stewardess sternly told me that she could not allow me to get off. (now I’m mad!) I said I am a grown man who bought this ticket, who’s time is mine with a family at home and I am going through that door, or I’m going through that door with you under my arm!! But I am going through that door!! And I heard a voice behind me say so am I. Then everyone behind us started to get up and say the same. Within 2 minutes, I was walking off that plane where I was met with more agents who asked me to write a statement. I had 5 hours to kill at this point so why the hell not. Due to the amount of people who got off that flight, it was cancelled. I was supposed to be in Houston at 6pm. I got here at 12:30am.
Look up the date. Flight 297 Atlanta to Houston.
If this wasn’t a dry run, I don’t know what one is. They wanted to see how TSA would handle it, how the crew would handle it, and how the passengers would handle it.
I’m telling this to you because I want you to know.
The threat is real. I saw it with my own eyes

https://www.truthorfiction.com/alaskan-view-palin/	Alaskan’s Opinion of GOP VP Candidate Sarah Palin	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Written by Deb in AK, Friday, 8/29/2008: One Alaskans opinion about our new Republican VP candidate… 
 Feel free to agree or disagree, but here is an Alaskan’s viewpoint on our new VP candidate (and it is an opinion shared by the vast majority of Alaskan residents). 
 Sarah Palin is the US’s answer to Margaret Thatcher! 
 Anyone who thinks she cannot handle the job or deal briskly and efficiently with ANY issue, including foreign governments … well, they haven’t met our Sarah <grin>. She is not “just a woman”, she is not “just a way to get votes” and if anyone expects her to smile, simper and be sweet – they don’t know Sarah. She is *more than* qualified for the job and the best possible choice McCain could have made. 
 As an Alaskan resident as well as a resident of Wasilla, AK, where Sarah Palin was at one time Mayor … I can speak with confidence. Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska is exactly what she portrayed during her introduction this morning and exactly what our US Government needs. She is ethical to a fault (if there is such a thing), a refreshing change to the status-quo and as smart and determined a PERSON (gender really isn’t an issue here as far as I’m concerned) as anyone could ask for at the head of government. 
 Sarah is no naïve “small town mayor” – she just *started out* there. Btw, as Mayor of Wasilla, she brought this “small town” through a lot of GOOD changes and left it at the end of her term having grown to the 4th largest CITY in Alaska – a lot of growth and a stronger economic base than ever before. 
 She has EXECUTIVE experience *running a government* (something NONE of the other candidates can actually boast, even John McCain <g>) as Governor of Alaska and got there by defeating the *incumbent* Republican Governor, who was definitely part of the “old school” and who WAS very much in the pocket of the big oil companies. We in Alaska wanted change -and we got it in the person of Sarah Palin! 
 Sarah Palin is everything she looks to be and more. Her approval rating as Governor of Alaska has been as high as 95% and is currently leveled out consistently in the upper 80 percentile throughout the state (and in both parties) – the HIGHEST approval rating of ANY sitting Governor. 
 Sarah has been turning around corruption in the Legislature of Alaska – turning things on their ear for that matter; cutting spending in spite of the increased income the state is currently receiving due to the high oil prices – she has insisted on putting a huge amount of the “windfall” into savings for the future rather than spending, spending, spending – and has insisted from the get-go on what she refers to as “honest, ethical and transparent governing” – no more closed door meetings and dealings – the big oil companies thought she would be a pushover and have learned better to their chagrin.
 She understands the “real people” and the economic issues we all face (Alaskans along with the rest of the country) – she was one of “us” not long ago. Rather than passing useless “laws” or throwing money at pet projects, she (most recently) temporarily suspended the state gas tax (on gasoline at the pumps, fuel oil and natural gas for homes, etc.) and has ordered checks issued to ALL residents of Alaska this fall in an attempt to assist with the burden of high fuel costs for the upcoming winter. I could go on and on, but that’s enough for now <smile>. She isn’t doing these things to be popular – she is doing it because her constituents are HURTING financially and she is in a position to help. 
 She became Governor of Alaska by defeating the Incumbent Republican Governor and doing it *without* the money or the support of the Republican Party, which was amazing in itself – and she won by a landslide. The “powers that be” at that time totally underestimated Sarah and learned better the hard way. Let’s hope Obama does the same. Sarah has done exactly what she claimed she was going to do when elected and is just as popular today as the day she was elected – perhaps more so since even the Democrats up here seem to like her – she works well with both sides in the Legislature here.
 Sarah “belongs” to us (Alaskans) … and although we are going to be terribly sorry to see her leave before she finishes the job she started here (two years ago) straightening out OUR State <grin> … we understand she is needed for a bigger purpose and hopefully her Lt. Governor will be able to fill her shoes here and continue the job.
 As for worrying about what would happen if McCain were to die or step down or whatever … here in AK we’ve only been wondering how long we would be able to KEEP Sarah in Alaska and have seen her as our first woman President of the USA from the start. It’s always been a matter of whether she would wait until the end of her TWO terms as Governor (no doubt at ALL that she would be re-elected if she ran for a second term at the end of her current term) … or end up in Washington sooner. She could do the job TODAY. 
 Personally, I feel a lot better about McCain now that I know he has someone as savvy, as strong, as ethical and as steady as Sarah at his back. She will be an excellent Vice President … and my guess is she will be our US Republican Presidential candidate in four years – AND by then the country will KNOW her – will love and respect her as we do here – and she’ll win by as much of a landslide as she did here in Alaska. I only wonder if McCain has a clue what he is unleashing on the US of A <grin>. She is going to be a fresh wind, but also a strong wind.
 Is that enough of an endorsement? If not, I’ll add this … my husband and I have for many years felt the best “vote” was to vote for the lesser of two “evils” and hope they didn’t do too much damage. Two years ago during our State Governor’s race was the first time EVER that we actually asked for not just a little sign to put in our yard showing our support of our candidate (something we’ve never felt the desire to do at all before) – we asked for a full 4′ x 8′ “SARAH PALIN FOR GOVERNOR!” sign and were proud to display it. She hasn’t let us or Alaska down. She will do the same for the USA if given the opportunity. 
 Feel free to pass this on to anyone who may be interested (and spam those who aren’t!).

https://www.truthorfiction.com/alex-singleton-obama/	President Obama Criticized by an Editor of London Daily Telegraph	 Mostly Fiction!				2015/03/17	"LONDON DAILY TELEGRAPH – very astute! The American people can now more readily “understand” why the Obama’s were omitted from the guest list to the Royal wedding in April! This is a very sobering article. Our handling of relationships with the Britons over the oil spill didn’t help either.
From The London Daily Telegraph Editor On Foreign Relations Alex Singleton
Quote:
“Let me be clear: I’m not normally in favor of boycotts, and I love the American people. I holiday in their country regularly, and hate the tedious snobby sneers against the United States . But the American people chose to elect an idiot who seems hell bent on insulting their allies, and something must be done to stop Obama’s reckless foreign policy, before he does the dirty on his allies on every issue.”
One of the most poorly kept secrets in Washington is President Obama’s animosity toward Great Britain , presumably because of what he regards as its sins while ruling Kenya (1895-1963). One of Barack Hussein Obama’s first acts as president was to return to Britain a bust of Winston Churchill that had graced the Oval Office since 9/11. He followed this up by denying Prime Minister Gordon Brown, on his first state visit, the usual joint press conference with flags.
The president was “too tired” to grant the leader of America ‘s closest ally a proper welcome, his aides told British journalists.
Mr. Obama followed this up with cheesy gifts for Mr. Brown and the Queen. Columnist Ian Martin described his behavior as “rudeness personified.” There was more rudeness in store for Mr. Brown at the opening session of the United Nations in September. “The prime minister was forced to dash through the kitchens of the UN in New York to secure five minutes of face time with President Obama after five requests for a sit down meeting were rejected by the White House”, said London Telegraph columnist David Hughes. Mr. Obama’s “churlishness is unforgivable”, Mr.. Hughes said.
The administration went beyond snubs and slights last week when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed the demand of Argentine President Cristina Kirchner, a Hugo Chavez ally, for mediation of Argentina ‘s specious claim to the Falkland Islands, a British dependency since 1833. The people who live in the Falklands, who speak English, want nothing to do with Argentina .
When, in 1982, an earlier Argentine dictatorship tried to seize the Falklands by force, the British — with strong support from President Ronald Reagan — expelled them.
“It is truly shocking that Barack Obama has decided to disregard our shared history,” wrote Telegraph columnist Toby Young. “Does Britain ‘s friendship really mean so little to him?” One could ask, does the friendship of anyone in the entire world mean anything to him?
“I recently asked several senior administration officials, separately, to name a foreign leader with whom Barack Obama has forged a strong personal relationship during his first year in office,”
wrote Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of the Washington Post, on Monday. “A lot of hemming and hawing ensued.”  One official named French President Nicolas Sarkozy, but his contempt for Mr. Obama is an open secret. Another named German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But, said Mr. Diehl, “Merkel too has been conspicuously cool toward Obama.”
Mr. Obama certainly doesn’t care about the Poles and Czechs, whom he has betrayed on missile defense. Honduras and Israel also can attest that he’s been an unreliable ally and an unfaithful friend.
Ironically, our relations with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have never been worse. Russia has offered nothing in exchange for Mr. Obama’s abandonment of missile defense. Russia
and China won’t support serious sanctions on Iran . Syria ‘s support for terrorism has not diminished despite efforts to normalize diplomatic relations. The reclusive military dictatorship that runs Burma has responded to our efforts at “engagement” by deepening its ties to North Korea ..
And the Chinese make little effort to disguise their contempt for him.
For the first time in a long time, the President of the United States is actually distrusted by its allies and not in the least feared by its adversaries. Nor is Mr. Obama now respected by the majority of Americans. Understandably focused on the dismal  economy and Mr. Obama’s relentless efforts to nationalize and socialize health care, Americans apparently have yet to notice his  dismal performance and lack of respect in the world community.
They soon will.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pat-boone-president-country/	“The President Without a Country” an Opinion by Pat Boone	  Opinion!				2015/03/17	"The president without a country By Pat Boone
 “We’re no longer a Christian nation.” – President Barack Obama, June 2007 “America has been arrogant.” – President Barack Obama “After 9/11, America didn’t always live up to her ideals.”- President Barack Obama “You might say that America is a Muslim nation.”- President Barack Obama, Egypt 2009
 Thinking about these and other statements made by the man who wears the title of president, I keep wondering what country he believes he’s president of.
 In one of my very favorite stories, Edward Everett Hale’s “The Man without a Country,” a young Army lieutenant named Philip Nolan stands condemned for treason during the Revolutionary War, having come under the influence of Aaron Burr. When the judge asks him if he wishes to say anything before sentence is passed, young Nolan defiantly exclaims, “Damn the United States! I wish I might never hear of the United States again!”
 The stunned silence in the courtroom is palpable, pulsing. After a long pause, the judge soberly says to the angry lieutenant: “You have just pronounced your own sentence. You will never hear of the United States again… I sentence you to spend the rest of your life at sea, on one or another of this country’s naval vessels – under strict orders that no one will ever speak to you again about the country you have just cursed.”
 And so it was. Philip Nolan was taken away and spent the next 40 years at sea, never hearing anything but an occasional slip of the tongue about America. The last few pages of the story, recounting Nolan’s dying hours in his small stateroom – now turned into a shrine to the country he fore swore – never fail to bring me to tears. And I find my own love for this dream, this miracle called America, refreshed and renewed. I know how blessed and unique we are.
 But reading and hearing the audacious, shocking statements of the man who was recently elected our president – a young black man living the impossible dream of millions of young Americans, past and present, black and white – I want to ask him, “Just what country do you think you’re president of?”
 You surely can’t be referring to the United States of America, can you? America is emphatically a Christian nation, and has been from its inception! Seventy percent of her citizens identify themselves as Christian. The Declaration of Independence and our Constitution were framed, written and ratified by Christians. It’s because this was, and is, a nation built on and guided by Judeo-Christian biblical principles that you, sir, have had the inestimable privilege of being elected her president.
 You studied law at Harvard, didn’t you, sir? You taught constitutional law in Chicago? Did you not ever read the statement of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and an author of the landmark “Federalist Papers”: “Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers – and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation – to select and prefer Christians for their rulers”?
 In your studies, you surely must have read the decision of the Supreme Court in 1892: “Our lives and our institutions must necessarily be based upon and embody the teachings of the Redeemer of mankind. It is impossible that it should be otherwise; and in this sense and to this extent our civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian.”
 Did your professors have you skip over all the high-court decisions right up till the mid 1900’s that echoed and reinforced these views and intentions? Did you pick up the history of American jurisprudence only in 1947, when for the first time a phrase coined by Thomas Jefferson about a “wall of separation between church and state” was used to deny some specific religious expression – contrary to Jefferson’ s intent with that statement?
 Or, wait a minute – were your ideas about America’s Christianity formed during the 20 years you were a member of the Trinity United Church of Christ under your pastor, Jeremiah Wright? Is that where you got the idea that “America is no longer a Christian nation”? Is this where you, even as you came to call yourself a Christian, formed the belief that “America has been arrogant”?
 Even if that’s the understandable explanation of your damning of your country and accusing the whole nation (not just a few military officials trying their best to keep more Americans from being murdered by jihadists) of “not always living up to her ideals,” how did you come up with the ridiculous, alarming notion that we might be “considered a Muslim nation”?
 Is it because there are some 2 million or more Muslims living here, trying to be good Americans? Out of a current population of over 300 million, 70 percent of whom are Christians? Does that make us, by any rational definition, a “Muslim nation”?
 Why are we not, then, a “Chinese nation”? A “Korean nation”? Even a “Vietnamese nation”? There are even more of these distinct groups in America than Muslims. And if the distinction you’re trying to make is a religious one, why is America not “a Jewish nation”? There’s actually a case to be made for the latter, because our Constitution – and the success of our Revolution and founding – owe a deep debt to our Jewish brothers.
 Have you stopped to think what an actual Muslim America would be like? Have you ever really spent much time in Iran? Even in Egypt? You, having been instructed in Islam as a kid at a Muslim school in Indonesia and saying you still love the call to evening prayers, can surely picture our nation founded on the Quran, not the Judeo-Christian Bible, and living under Shariah law. Can’t you? You do recall Muhammad’s directives [Surah 9:5,73] to “break the cross” and “kill the infidel”?
 It seems increasingly and painfully obvious that you are more influenced by your upbringing and questionable education than most suspected. If you consider yourself the president of a people who are “no longer Christian,” who have “failed to live up to our ideals,” who “have been arrogant,” and might even be “considered Muslim” – you are president of a country most Americans don’t recognize.
 Could it be you are a president without a country?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/az-senator-allen/	Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen Explains Why She Supports SB 1070, The Border State’s Tough New Immigration Law	Commentary!				2015/03/17	"Subject: In her own words—Arizona Senator Sylvia Allen 
GOOD GOING ARIZONA,
I’m Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen. I want to explain SB 1070 which I voted for and was just signed by Governor Jan Brewer. Rancher Rob Krentz was murdered by the drug cartel on his ranch a month ago. I participated in a senate hearing two weeks ago on the border violence, here is just some of the highlights from those who testified. 
The people who live within 60 to 80 miles of the Arizona/Mexico Border have for years been terrorized and have pleaded for help to stop the daily invasion of humans who cross their property . One Rancher testified that 300 to 1200 people a DAY come across his ranch vandalizing his property, stealing his vehicles and property, cutting down his fences, and leaving trash. In the last two years he has found 17 dead bodies and two Koran bibles. 
Another rancher testified that daily drugs are brought across his ranch in a military operation. A point man with a machine gun goes in front, 1/2 mile behind are the guards fully armed, 1/2 mile behind them are the drugs, behind the drugs 1/2 mile are more guards. These people are violent and they will kill anyone who gets in the way. This was not the only rancher we heard that day that talked about the drug trains. 
One man told of two illegal’s who came upon his property one shot in the back and the other in the arm by the drug runners who had forced them to carry the drugs and then shot them. Daily they listen to gun fire during the night it is not safe to leave his family alone on the ranch and they can’t leave the ranch for fear of nothing being left when they come back. 
The border patrol is not on the border. They have set up 60 miles away with check points that do nothing to stop the invasion. They are not allowed to use force in stopping anyone who is entering. They run around chasing them, if they get their hands on them then they can take them back across the border.  
Federal prisons have over 35% illegal’s and 20% of Arizona prisons are filled with illegal’s. In the last few years 80% of our law enforcement that have been killed or wounded have been by an illegal. 
The majority of people coming now are people we need to be worried about. The ranchers told us that they have seen a change in the people coming they are not just those who are looking for work and a better life. 
The Federal Government has refused for years to do anything to help the border states . We have been over run and once they are here we have the burden of funding state services that they use. Education cost have been over a billion dollars. The healthcare cost billions of dollars. Our State is broke, $3.5 billion deficit and we have many serious decisions to make. One is that we do not have the money to care for any who are not here legally. It has to stop. The border can be secured. We have the technology we have the ability to stop this invasion. We must know who is coming and they must come in an organized manner legally so that we can assimilate them into our population and protect the sovereignty of our country. We are a nation of laws. We have a responsibility to protect our citizens and to protect the integrity of our country and the government which we live under. 
I would give amnesty today to many, but here is the problem, we dare not do this until the Border is secure. It will do no good to forgive them because thousands will come behind them and we will be over run to the point that there will no longer be the United States of America but a North American Union of open borders. I ask you what form of government will we live under? How long will it be before we will be just like Mexico , Canada or any of the other Central American or South American countries? We have already lost our language, everything must be printed in Spanish also. We have already lost our history it is no longer taught in our schools. And we have lost our borders. 
The leftist media has distorted what SB 1070 will do. It is not going to set up a Nazi Germany . Are you kidding. The ACLU and the leftist courts will do everything to protect those who are here illegally, but it was an effort to try and stop illegal’s from setting up businesses, and employment, and receiving state services and give the ability to local law enforcement when there is probable cause like a traffic stop to determine if they are here legally. Federal law is very clear if you are here on a visa you must have your papers on you at all times. That is the law. In Arizona all you need to show you are a legal citizen is a driver license, MVD identification card, Native American Card, or a Military ID. This is what you need to vote, get a hunting license, etc.. So nothing new has been added to this law. No one is going to be stopped walking down the street etc… The Socialist who are in power in DC are angry because we dare try and do something and that something the Socialist wants us to do is just let them come. They want the “Transformation” to continue. 
Maybe it is too late to save America . Maybe we are not worthy of freedom anymore. But as an elected official I must try to do what I can to protect our Constitutional Republic . Living in America is not a right just because you can walk across the border. Being an American is a responsibility and it comes by respecting and upholding the Constitution the law of our land which says what you must do to be a citizen of this country. Freedom is not free.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ben-bernanke-bar/	Ben Bernanke Told Everyone At a Neighborhood Bar How Screwed The Economy Really Is	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"OMG! 
 Talk about committing career suicide! I just got this and I’ve included Snopes and Truthorfiction in the “copy to” window. At this point I can’t be sure if it’s true or BS. I’ll let you know if Snopes verifies it or whatever. I’ve got a feeling that it won’t be seen in the mainstream media. 
 Drunken Ben Bernanke Tells Everyone At Neighborhood Bar How Screwed U.S. Economy Really Is The Onion – America’s Finest New. 
SEWARD, NE—Claiming he wasn’t afraid to let everyone in attendance know about “the real mess we’re in,” Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke reportedly got drunk Tuesday and told everyone at Elwood’s Corner Tavern about how absolutely fucked the U.S. economy actually is.
 Bernanke, who sources confirmed was “totally sloshed,” arrived at the drinking establishment at approximately 5:30 p.m., ensconced himself upon a bar stool, and consumed several bottles of Miller High Life and a half-dozen shots of whiskey while loudly proclaiming to any patron who would listen that the economic outlook was “pretty goddamned awful if you want the God’s honest truth.”
 “Look, they don’t want anyone except for the Washington, D.C. bigwigs to know how bad shit really is,” said Bernanke, slurring his words as he spoke. “Mounting debt exacerbated—and not relieved—by unchecked consumption, spiraling interest rates, and the grim realities of an inevitable worldwide energy crisis are projected to leave our entire economy in the shitter for, like, a generation, man, I’m telling you.”
 And hell, as long as we’re being honest, I might as well tell you that a truer estimate of the U.S. unemployment rate is actually up around 16 percent, with a 0.7 percent annual rate of economic growth if we’re lucky—if we’re lucky,” continued Bernanke, nearly knocking a full beer over while gesturing with his hands. “Of course, if everybody knew that, it would likely cripple financial markets across the entire fucking globe, even in various emerging economies with self- sustaining growth.”
 After launching into an extended 45-minute diatribe about shortsighted moves by “those bastards in Congress” that could potentially exacerbate the nation’s already deeply troublesome budget imbalance, the Federal Reserve chairman reportedly bought a round of tequila shots for two customers he had just met who were seated on either side of him, announcing, “I love these guys.”
 Numerous bar patrons slowly nodded in agreement as Bernanke went on to suggest the United States could pass three or four more stimulus packages and “it wouldn’t even matter.”
 “You think that’s going to create long-term economic growth, let alone promote job creation?” Bernanke said. “We’re way beyond that, my friend. There are no jobs, okay? There’s nothing. I think that calls for another drink, don’t you?”
 While using beer bottles and pretzel sticks in an attempt to explain to the bartender the importance of infusing $650 billion into the bond market, the inebriated Fed chairman nearly fell off his stool and had to be held up by the patron sitting next to him.
 Another bargoer confirmed Bernanke stood about 2 inches from her face and sprayed her with saliva, claiming inflation was going to “totally screw” consumer confidence and then asking if he could bum a smoke.
 “Sure, we could hold down long-term interest rates and pursue a program of quantitative easing, but c’mon, we all know that’s not going to make the slightest bit of difference when it comes to output, demand, or employment,” Bernanke said before being told to “try to keep [his] voice down” by the bartender. “And trust me, with the value of the U.S. dollar in the toilet, import costs going through the roof, and numerous world governments unprepared for their own substantial debt burdens, shit’s not looking too good for us abroad, either.”
 “God, I’m so wasted,” added Bernanke, resting his head on the bar.
 Later in the evening, Richard Kampman, a truck driver who was laid off in 2010, said Bernanke approached him in the men’s restroom and attempted to strike up a conversation about various factors contributing to the current financial crisis.
 “He stumbled up to the urinal and started mumbling on about the depressed housing sector or something,” said Kampman, who claimed Bernanke had to use both hands on the wall to steady himself. “Then after a while he just sort of stopped and I couldn’t tell if he was laughing or crying.”
 “Then he puked all over the sink and the mirror,” Kampman added.
 Customers at the bar told reporters the “shitfaced” and disruptive Bernanke refused to pay for his drinks with U.S. currency, claiming it was “worthless.” Witnesses also confirmed that near the end of the evening, Bernanke put money into the jukebox and selected Dire Straits’ “Money For Nothing” to play five times in a row.
 “This is what it’s all about,” said Bernanke, who reportedly danced alone in the middle of the dark tavern. “Fucking love this song.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/biden-million-trips/	News Article Said Vice President Biden’s Weekend Trips Cost Taxpayers $1 Million Annually	Truth!				2015/03/17	"
Biden Spends $1 Million Annually for Weekend Trips
By Ronald Kessler  reporting from Washington, D.C. —
Last June, President Obama appointed Vice President Joe Biden to root out wasteful government spending. But behind the scenes, it’s a different matter.
Every Friday, Biden takes a helicopter designated as Marine Two from the vice president’s residence to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and then hops on Air Force Two to fly back to his home in Delaware. At the end of the weekend, he returns on Air Force Two, usually a Boeing C-32.
During warm weather, Biden regularly returns to Andrews on the airplane on Saturdays to play golf at the Air Force base with President Obama. After the golf game, he flies back to Delaware and returns to Washington on the plane on Sunday evening — all at taxpayer expense.
The cost of flying Air Force Two is $22,000 an hour, so each half-hour trip to or from Delaware costs about $10,000. Each golf game costs taxpayers $20,000. At that rate, the annual cost to taxpayers of Biden’s weekend trips is well over $1 million.
In addition, the Secret Service rents more than 20 condominiums in the Wilmington, Del. area for agents who must accompany Biden when he returns to his home state.
Biden’s press office had no immediate comment.
“Biden leaves every Friday from Joint Base Andrews, so he gets lifts from the observatory via Marine Two to Andrews Air Force Base, takes off via Air Force Two, lands in Delaware, and stays the weekend and then comes back on Sunday nights,” says a Secret Service agent familiar with the trips.
Biden has been a long-time proponent of train travel.
“Every three or four weeks when it’s warm, he gets up there on Saturday and then will fly back on Air Force Two,” the agent says. “While Air Force Two is sitting on the tarmac at Andrews, he goes and plays golf with the president at Andrews Air Force Base, gets back on the plane, and flies back to Delaware. Let me tell you something, that is egregious.”
Besides that, “The Secret Service rents condos in Wilmington because his schedule is so fluid and never concrete enough to properly prepare for his visits to Delaware,” the agent says. “So they keep a fully staffed Secret Service advance team in Delaware in condominiums that we lease so that when he does these things back and forth to D.C., they’re up there ready for him to arrive.”
The Boeing C-32 that usually flies as Air Force Two is a specially configured Boeing 757-200 commercial jet which typically requires a crew of 18.
As a U.S. senator, Biden was proud of the fact that he commuted daily by train from his home in Delaware to Washington during the week. Amtrak named the newly renovated Wilmington station the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Railroad Station. But after taking office as vice president, a Secret Service agent says Biden began the pattern of commuting on Air Force Two on weekends, costing taxpayers close to $4 million so far.
As recently as May 12, Biden flew back to Andrews to play golf with Obama and with Biden’s second son Hunter and White House trip director Marvin Nicholson. They played 18 holes of golf for four and a half hours.
Biden also plays golf at a country club he belongs to in the Wilmington area. The Secret Service agent says that since Air Force Two parks at Andrews, Obama is obviously aware that Biden is running up a huge government tab for each game of golf he plays with him.
Asked if President Obama thinks these costs are appropriate, why he has not questioned Biden flying to play golf with him at a cost of $20,000 per game, and in view of these costs of $1 million a year for weekend trips, whether the vice president should no longer be in charge of cutting government waste, the president’s press office had no immediate comment.
In addition to his salary as vice president of $230,700, Biden has free use of the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory. The vice president’s residence is a handsome 9,150-square-foot, three-story mansion overlooking Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington.
Complete with pool, pool house, and indoor gym, the white brick house was built in 1893 as the home of the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Congress turned it into the official residence of the vice president in 1974 and gave it the address One Observatory Circle.
During the day, at least five Navy stewards attend to every personal need of the second family, including cleaning, cooking, shopping for food, and doing the laundry.
Biden has portrayed himself as a regular Joe, a product of a working class family who takes on millionaires and Republicans who are said to be out of touch with middle-class Americans.
Last June 13, Obama placed Biden in charge of a Campaign to Cut Waste, which will “hunt down and eliminate misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the federal government,” according to the White House website.
In an email, Biden told supporters that he was the “new sheriff in town.” He said that “particularly at a time when we’re facing tough decisions about reducing our deficit, it’s a no-brainer to stop spending taxpayer dollars on things that benefit nobody.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/berkeley/	Berkeley, California, Asked a Marine Recruiting Station to Leave the City	Truth!  But Reversed!				2015/03/17	"  
BERKELEY, Calif. Local officials in this liberal city say it’s time for the U.S. Marines to move out. 
The City Council has voted to tell the Marines their downtown recruiting station is not welcome and  if recruiters choose to stay, they do so as uninvited and unwelcome guests.’ 
The measure passed this week by a vote of 8-1.
******* 
Now check this out, here is a letter a businessman wrote to the Mayor of Berkeley. Is this a great country or what?
………………..and this is the kind of response it takes from Americans to stand up against the tide of apathy and self serving idiots. http://www.anewtone.com/
I pasted the story in below, but you can see the site story for yourself.
*******
Dear Mayor Bates,
In that you and your city have chosen to gravely insult the brave men and women, who have indeed bought you that right with their blood, I am informing you that my company will no longer do business with any of our current suppliers located in the Berkeley, California metro area. 
In that my company is in international resort real estate development, and do business with and am associated with, developers and investors worldwide, I am informing all of my contacts, associates and patrons that we will no longer do any business of any sort with anyone living in the Berkeley area. 
In that we/MDG Resorts are currently building a state of the art mega-yacht marina, all of the suppliers of Marina equipment, all owners of Yachts, all suppliers of Yacht materials & supplies, all yacht brokers and all tangential yacht business purveyors will likewise be informed that we will not do any business whatsoever with anyone from the Berkeley area. 
Likewise all suppliers of building materials, both interior and exterior, currently associated with any of our several resort developments (Brisamar 300+ villas and 200+ condos: Porto Hussong, 500+ condos, 180 slip mega-yacht marina) both of which I might add have international recognition by virtue of glowing reports in Robb Report, Wall Street Journal, Yacht World, Forbes. 
I will likewise inform all of our investors, most of whom are very wealthy yacht owners, casino owners, high net worth international businessmen, of our decision to essentially boycott all products and providers located in, or associated with in any way whatsoever, Berkeley, Ca. 
Trust me when I say that having been in the real estate development business for over 35 years, our list of contacts and associates is long and very, very impressive. We, and I personally, are going to recomend that they ALL along with us boycott your city, its purveyors, suppliers, and businesses and CHARITIES of every kind.  
You have every right to choose to take the obnoxious anti-military stance you have taken, and as stated, that right was bought for you with the blood of better men than you. 
I too have every right to do all that I can to insure that your city suffers consequences arising from that obnoxious, sickening stance. 
Cordially, 
Brian G Dennard

Date: Tue, 16 Sep 2008 




On or about October 5th, Biden will excuse himself from the ticket, citing health problems, and he will be replaced by Hillary. This is timed to occur after the VP debate on 10/2. 


There have been talks all weekend about how to proceed with this info. Generally, the feeling is that we should all go ahead and get it out there to as many blog sites and personal email lists as is possible. I have already seen a few short blurbs about this – the ‘health problem’ cited in those articles was aneurysm. Probably many of you have heard the same rumblings. 


However, at this point, with this inside info from the DNC, it looks like this Obama strategy will be a go. Therefore, it seems that the best strategy is to get out in front of this Obama maneuver, spell it out in detail, and thereby expose it for the grand manipulation that it is. 


So, let’s start mixing this one up and cut the Obamites off at the pass – send this info out to as many people as you can – post about it on websites and blogs – etc

https://www.truthorfiction.com/chief-justice-roberts-genius/	“Chief Justice Roberts Is A Genius”	Commentary!				2015/03/17	"Subject: Chief Justice Roberts Is A Genius
Posted on June 28, 2012 by I.M. Citizen
Before you look to do harm to Chief Justice Roberts or his family, it’s important that you think carefully about the meaning – the true nature — of his ruling on Obama-care. The Left will shout that they won, that Obama-care was upheld and all the rest. Let them.
It will be a short-lived celebration.
Here’s what really occurred — payback. Yes, payback for Obama’s numerous, ill-advised and childish insults directed toward SCOTUS.
Chief Justice Roberts actually ruled the mandate, relative to the commerce clause, was unconstitutional. That’s how the Democrats got Obama-care going in the first place. This is critical. His ruling means Congress can’t compel American citizens to purchase anything. Ever. The notion is now officially and forever, unconstitutional. As it should be.
Next, he stated that, because Congress doesn’t have the ability to mandate, it must, to fund Obama-care, rely on its power to tax. Therefore, the mechanism that funds Obama-care is a tax. This is also critical. Recall back during the initial Obama-care battles, the Democrats called it a penalty, Republicans called it a tax.


Democrats consistently soft sold it as a penalty. It went to vote as a penalty. Obama declared endlessly, that it was not a tax, it was a penalty. But when the Democrats argued in front of the Supreme Court, they said ‘hey, a penalty or a tax, either way’. So, Roberts gave them a tax. It is now the official law of the land — beyond word-play and silly shenanigans. Obama-care is funded by tax dollars. Democrats now must defend a tax increase to justify the Obama-care law.
Finally, he struck down as unconstitutional, the Obama-care idea that the federal government can bully states into complying by yanking their existing medicaid funding. Liberals, through Obama-care, basically said to the states — ‘comply with Obama-care or we will stop existing funding.’ Roberts ruled that is a no-no. If a state takes the money, fine, the Feds can tell the state how to run a program, but if the state refuses money, the federal government can’t penalize the state by yanking other funding. Therefore, a state can decline to participate in Obama-care without penalty. This is obviously a serious problem. Are we going to have 10, 12, 25 states not participating in “national” health-care? Suddenly, it’s not national, is it?
Ultimately, Roberts supported states rights by limiting the federal government’s coercive abilities. He ruled that the government can not force the people to purchase products or services under the commerce clause and he forced liberals to have to come clean and admit that Obama-care is funded by tax increases.
Although he didn’t guarantee Romney a win, he certainly did more than his part and should be applauded.
And he did this without creating a civil war or having bricks thrown through his windshield. Oh, and he’ll be home in time for dinner.
Brilliant.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/chinese-flag-at-white-house/	Chinese flag will be hoisted over the White House South Lawn on September 20, 2009	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"eRumor sample #1: The People’s Republic of China is celebrating 60 years of hard core communism … by raising the flag of that communist country on the south lawn of the White House on September 20. Well, that is what two Chinese sources are reporting. China Daily reported — apparently unnoticed until last week — that the Fujian Association had applied to the White House for permission to hold a celebration to honor the founding of the People’s Republic of China, and to hoist that country’s red flag on the south lawn of the White House.
 Chen Ronghua, a Spokesman for the Fujian Association, said that permission was approved because of closer China-U.S. relations in recent years. And because, “Many Americans admire China due to the success of last year’s Beijing’s Olympics,” he said. 
 Also involved in the celebration are the Union of Chinese American Professional Organizations and the coordination Council of Chinese-American Associations. The ceremony is to be hosted by other “overseas Chinese organizations,” according to the Chinese publication Global Times.
 Approximately 1,000 people are expected to attend the flag-raising ceremony.
 While the flags of many nations are flown at the White House when dignitaries of those countries visit, this seems to be the first time a foreign nation’s flag will be hoisted to celebrate that country’s founding, communist or not. 
 There is no flag rule or regulation that prohibits the flying of flags from foreign nations at the White House; although the Capitol grounds are another matter. The updated 2008 federal flag code is a bit confusing, but it says no flag can fly higher on American soil than the U.S. flag, except for the UN flag at UN headquarters. So there is no direct violation of the U.S. flag code here. 
 But it does seem to be culturally and universally understood by patriots of all nations that one wouldn’t want to fly the flag of a rival nation that has a governmental philosophy that is diametrically opposed to the founding principles of your own nation. 
 If the Chinese flag is raised on the south lawn of the White House on September 20, then perhaps the present occupants of the White House, appointees and advisors, see little difference between their own political beliefs — statist-to-socialist — compared to the statist-to-full-fledged-communist outlook of their confreres in Beijing. 
 Veterans and other patriotic groups should be adamantly opposed to any plan to hoist a communist flag over American soil. Many placed their lives on the line, fighting and witnessing the utter brutality of communist regimes in Russia, Korea, North Vietnam — all of whom are supported by the Soviets and the Chinese Communists. Today, the human rights record inside China is as dismal as they come. Their murderously enforced one-child family policy is an abomination as well. But all this matters not to the White House.
 “It was always my dream to raise a Chinese flag in the center of Washington, D.C.,” says Chen Ronghua. “This year, my motherland’s 60th birthday, is the perfect time for it.” September 20 will be the day we find out whether Chinese sources were correct in their reporting and the Chinese flag is raised on U.S. soil in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the deadliest regime in all of history. And if so, what’s next: May Day parades to celebrate the Russian communist worker, or Mao’s image on Mount Rushmore?
 http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-07/13/content_8422505.htm  The national flag of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) will be hoisted at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on September 20, media reported  Sunday. 
 Chinese associations in the United States had applied to hold a ceremony in front of the US President’s residence to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of PRC. Chen Ronghua, chairman of Fujian Association of the United States, told reporters that their application was approved not only because of the sound Sino-US relations but also because China is a responsible country. “Many Americans admire China due to the success of last year’s Beijing Olympics,” said Chen. More than 1,000 people will attend the ceremony and the performances held after it, according to Zhao Luqun, who will direct the performances. Zhao said the performances will demonstrate the friendship, magnanimous spirit and kindness of modern Chinese people.
 
eRumor Sample#2:
White House to fly Red Chinese flag People’s Republic marking anniversary at White House ——————————————————————————– Posted: September 04, 2009 8:19 PM Eastern
 By Bob Unruh © 2009 WorldNetDaily
 alerts@news.worldnetdaily.com
 The administration of President Barack Obama, whose official blogger while Obama was a candidate came under attack for hanging a Communist Party flag in his Harvard apartment, apparently has given permission to raise the emblem of Communist China over the south lawn of the White House. 
 The plan, reported by several English-language Chinese media outlets, has raised concern among those who are working to guard the United States from outside influences that could be threats. 
 According to the Global Times English-language edition, the national flag of the communist People’s Republic of China on Sept. 20 will be raised for the first time on the White House’s south lawn – a secured area seldom available for public events – in recognition of the Chinese anniversary. 
 “The ceremony has gotten official approval,” Xiao Shuigen, secretary of the Union of Chinese American Professional Organizations, told the Times. 
 “It was always my dream to raise a Chinese flag in the center of Washington, D.C.,” Chen Ronghua, chief of the U.S.-Fujian Association, told the newspaper. “This year, my motherland’s 60th birthday, is the perfect time for it.” 
 According to China Daily, Chinese associations in the United States applied to have a ceremony. 
 Such emblems were an issue during Obama’s presidential campaign, when a Houston Fox TV affiliate captured images of a volunteer in an Obama campaign office working in front of a flag featuring the image of Che Guevara, the South American revolutionary who became Fidel Castro’s executioner after the communist takeover in Cuba.
 At that time, the Obama campaign issued a statement calling the flag “inappropriate” and noting that the office where it was displayed was funded by “volunteers” and was not the official campaign headquarters.
 However, it was Sam Graham-Felsen, a journalist-on-leave from The Nation, who joined Obama for America in 2007 and worked as the official blogger. He, according to a 2003 article in the Harvard Crimson, adorned one corner of his shared student apartment with “a Communist Party flag … Bought on their trip to Russia the summer after sophomore year.”
 The proposed event at the White House was condemned on the forums page on Fox News commentator Sean Hannity’s website. 
 “People could understand if there was a Chinese visitor at the White House and the Red flag was placed on the stage behind the speakers, but to hoist the commie pinko flag in ‘honor’ of the founding of the People’s Republic of China is absurd,” the forum participant said. “This only goes to prove the Obama administration is out-of-touch with the American people.” <
br/> William Gheen, chief of Americans for Legal Immigration, the pre-eminent organization battling against illegal immigration, said it’s the message that is sent to the world that will be significant. 
 “Our concern is that sovereign wealth funds, like the Chinese, now control the executive branch more than the American people,” he said. “China is not our friend. China is our enemy. Our enemy is coming and raising their own flag in a type of proclamation. 
 “I expect the Chinese media will make a big thing of it,” he said, saying something like, “‘Look how strong and powerful China is, raising our flag on the White House.'” 
 He said it conveys the same message as if Old Glory would be raised on the property of the Kremlin. 
 Gheen said the issue becomes clear “why the new water stations at illegal alien crossings into the United States have instructions in English, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese.” 
 At the Red County blog, the author said, “Celebrating Americans of Chinese descent is one thing. Celebrating Communism is another. Now our president will hoist the Communist flag over the White House. How fitting and in sync with his political belief system.” 
 A spokesman for the American Legion told WND that if the proper protocols are followed, there should be no issue with the actual display of a Chinese flag, especially since diplomatic visits routinely include the display of foreign flags. 
 But those with obviously U..S. Leanings on the Global Times forum page were outraged.
 “Another public short coming and failure by the Obama administration.”
 “UNBELIEVABLE!”
 “It can now be official – leave the flag there.”
 “So let me get this straight – the Chinese are going to celebrate the founding of their country on the south lawn of the White House! Did we celebrate the 4th of July in Beijing in front of their Leader’s House? What other proof do you need that Obama is the Manchurian Candidate.”
 “Oh Crap, Have the Chinese foreclosed on us already?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/bush-administration-lending/	Bush Administration Proposed a New Agency to oversee Housing Industry in 2003	Truth! 				2015/03/17	"New York Times – Five Years Ago I thought all of you may be interested in the following article reported in the New York Times five years ago. You won’t hear this from the liberal media ! It seems that the Bush administration proposed increased oversight and regulation of Fannie and Freddie, but Democrats fought it. 
Here’s the article: 
“The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago. Under the plan, disclosed at a Congressional hearing today, a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry. 
The new agency would have the authority, which now rests with Congress, to set one of the two capital-reserve requirements for the companies. It would exercise authority over any new lines of business. And it would determine whether the two are adequately managing the risks of their ballooning portfolios.” 
Democrats pushed back. “Among the groups denouncing the proposal today were the National Association of Home Builders and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to financing low-income and affordable housing”. 
“These two entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not facing any kind of financial crisis”, said Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. “The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.” 
Representative Melvin L. Watt,  Democrat of North Carolina, agreed. “I don’t see much other than a shell game going on here, moving something from one agency to another and in the process weakening the bargaining power of poorer families and their ability to get affordable housing,” Mr. Watt said. 
Please forward this to all on your list – and especially Independents and Democrats !!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-clinton-snared/	Has Bill Clinton Been Snared in a Pedophile Ring?	Pending Investigation!				2015/03/17	" Disgusting: Clinton Snared In Pedophile Ring  






According to former child sex slave Virginia Roberts and a class action lawsuit against convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, former President Bill Clinton was present during sex parties involving up to twenty underage girls at Epstein’s secluded island in the Caribbean. That flight records show Clinton was flown on numerous occasions to the island on Epstein’s private jet. Clinton had a close relationship with an employee of Epstein’s who compiled thousands of photos of nude young girls posed in lewd positions. And these photos were used as a catalog for Epstein to loan out his girls to powerful politicians and British royalty, including Bill Clinton. 
According to the lawsuit: 
…Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who “kept images of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein… and photographed underage females in sexually explicit poses.” 
While Epstein was indicted and jailed for his pedophilia, Bill Clinton oddly has remained unscathed, more than likely by having friends in high places. 
If Bill Clinton is in fact a pedophile, will the American people demand that he be put away for a very long time so that he can’t hurt any more children? Or will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Time will tell.

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard Said No to Sharia"	"Unproven!
"				2015/03/17	"A senior member of Australia’s government has said Muslims who want to live by Islamic Sharia law are not welcome in the country. The comments have stoked Muslim anger against the Australian government.
Australian Finance Minister Peter Costello said in a speech late Thursday that immigrants must respect the country’s laws and traditions. Costello singled out Muslims who wanted to live under Sharia law as not welcome in Australia.
In his speech on Australian citizenship, the minister said his remarks were directed at what he called a “small radical minority.” “You don’t have to swear at the football and eat a pie to be an Australian,” he said, “but you do have believe in democracy, the rule of law and the rights and liberties of others.”
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard also addressed Islamic extremism, saying it violated Australia’s principles. He pointed to contentious issues such as relations with non-Muslims and the rights of women.
Australian Muslims have reacted with anger to both sets of comments. They accuse the government of being deliberately inflammatory and divisive.
Keysar Trad, president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, says Costello’s comments are unnecessary. “He is singling out the Muslim community again,” he said. “Rather than calling on all citizens to respect the law of the land and respect traditional
values, he is making an inference in his comments that Muslims don’t do that. Well, on the contrary, Muslims do respect the law of the land and do respect the values of this country.”
There are around 300,000 Muslims in Australia.
Community leaders say racism toward this minority group has increased since the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001 and the bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali a year later, in which Australian tourists were targeted.

We’ve all known about this for some time…I think it’s call GREED AT THE FINEST….
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad owns all of the rail lines in the  US connecting to western Canada and they haul 80%+ of the crude from Canada to the midwest and Texas or charge other Short Line railroads a fee to use their tracks. BNSF charges $30 per barrel to haul the oil where the Keystone would cost $10 by the State Departments own estimates. BNSF is owned by Berkshire Hathaway whose chairman is Warren Buffet. In the last 2 election cycles Buffet gave extensively to democrat causes and candidates including $40K+ to Obama in 2012. He also bundled and hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama. If anyone here believes the pipeline isn’t being blocked by Obama on Buffets behalf you’re nuts. Buffet could stand to lose $2B+ a year if the pipeline goes in and he makes the same amount every year it’s delayed. This is crony capitalism at it’s finest and what is making people mad at our government and capitalist system.

This nineteen-year-old ex-cheerleader (now an Air Force Security Forces Sniper) was watching a road that led to a NATO military base when she observed a man digging by the road. She engaged the target (i.e., she shot him). Turned out he was a bomb maker for the Taliban and he was burying an IED that was to be detonated when a US patrol walked by 30 minutes later. It would have certainly killed and wounded several soldiers.
The interesting fact of this story is the shot was measured at 725 yards. She shot him as he was bent over burying the bomb. The shot went through his butt and into the bomb which detonated; he was blown to pieces. The Air Force made a motivational poster of her:

Bill Cosby on Rev. Wright 
Article from Wall Street Journal:
Rev. Wright epitomizes the thoughts and actions that have prevented and continue to prevent black America from moving ahead and achieving their potential as a people. He suggests that this United States of America made up of sons and daughters of immigrants (I’m talking of the millions of 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation immigrants in this country) of every race, creed, color and religion each and everyone of them who had nothing to do with slavery, some how owe something to a group of people who have never been slaves? Its amazing. It seems everyone is to blame for the shambles black society is in with its violence, drugs, high school drop out rates, misogyny, and a host of other real and virulent problems, except for the very people who engage in such behavior. 
 Enough. As a society, culture or people, they should look within themselves and fix their problems. 
 When did this man become the spokesman for the ‘black church’? And of course his church is different, but that doesn’t mean his message and philosophy is acceptable, or productive or non-offensive or not-racist or indicative or our greater cultural behaviors, values and norms Americans. 
 And yes, the link between this man and Obama really does matter. At a very minimum, it provides insight into the political and philosophical strain that Obama adheres to.

 Family, I feel an obligation to honesty and truth to share with you  some facts. My Father and Mother instilled in me the values and morals of treating people fairly and always being honest. If you purchase  something, you pay for it. If you borrow something, you give it back.
 I have been “stiffed” three times in my 30 year professional career by someone who I rendered services to, gave a finished product to, but who refused to pay for those services even though they acknowledged the services and products were correct, were what they asked for, and were never challenged for not being correct. I am lucky in having only  three, but those three hurt badly.
 Joe Biden was one of those people. I worked on his 1988 Presidential campaign financial disclosure engagement. I busted it for him and got everything right. He stiffed me for over $15,000 worth of work. He refused to pay once he dropped out of the race. I did similar Capitol Hill campaign financial disclosure work for Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, and a Democratic candidate for Ambassador to New Zealand. All of those folks paid even though they lost the election or did not get the appointment. That type of work is very demanding and very tedious because your efforts are scrutinized by Congress. Biden did not care.
 I am on the Board of Directors of a company that owns a majority position in a private jet management company in Northern Virginia. They manage jets for businesses and rich folks. They also charter planes to the public. This past winter John Thompson chartered over $250,000 worth of air time. He paid every penny.
 Joe Biden, in his latest unsuccessful run for President, chartered over $150,000 worth of air time. He PAID ZERO. He continues to refuse to pay stating his race is over and he is out of money. He never once complained about his flights. Joe Biden is a rich man. He could pay.
 Joe Biden is a liar and a cheat. I know it first hand. Character is what life is all about. Joe Biden is a man of bad character and sets a bad example for America.
 I feel compelled to share this dark side of a man who asks for your vote and trust.

 What you may not know about Herman Cain who is running for president…. He’s not a career politician (in fact he has never held political office). He’s known as a pizza guy, but there’s a lot more to him. He’s also a computer guy, a banker guy, and a rocket scientist guy. Here’s his bio: Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics.  Master’s degree in Computer Science.  Mathematician for the Navy, where he worked on missile ballistics (making him a rocket scientist).  Computer systems analyst for Coca-Cola.  VP of Corporate Data Systems and Services for Pillsbury (this is the top of the ladder in the computer world, being in charge of information systems for a major corporation).  All achieved before reaching the age of 35. Since he reached the top of the information systems world, he changed careers! Business Manager. Took charge of Pillsbury’s 400 Burger King restaurants in the Philadelphia area, which were the company’s poorest performers in the country. Spent the first nine months learning the business from the ground up, cooking hamburger and yes, cleaning toilets. After three years he had turned them into the company’s best performers.  Godfather’s Pizza CEO. Was asked by Pillsbury to take charge of their Godfather’s Pizza chain (which was on the verge of bankruptcy). He made it profitable in 14 months.  In 1988 he led a buyout of the Godfather’s Pizza chain from Pillsbury. He was now the owner of a restaurant chain. Again he reached the top of the ladder of another industry.  He was also chairman of the National Restaurant Association during this time. This is a group that interacts with government on behalf of the restaurant industry, and it gave him political experience from the non-politician side.  Having reached the top of a second industry, he changed careers again! Adviser to the Federal Reserve System. Herman Cain went to work for the Federal Reserve Banking System advising them on how monetary policy changes would affect American businesses.  Chairman of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. He worked his way up to the chairmanship of a regional Federal Reserve bank. This is only one step below the chairmanship of the entire Federal Reserve System (the top banking position in the country). This position allowed him to see how monetary policy is made from the inside, and understand the political forces that impact the monetary system.  After reaching the top of the banking industry, he changed careers for a fourth time! Writer and public speaker. He then started to write and speak on leadership. His books include Speak as a Leader, CEO of Self, Leadership  is Common Sense, and They Think You’re Stupid.  Radio Host. Around 2007—after a remarkable 40 year career—he started hosting a radio show on WSB in Atlanta (the largest talk radio station in the country).  He did all this starting from rock bottom (his father was a chauffeur and his mother was a maid). When you add up his accomplishments in his life—including reaching the top of three unrelated industries: information systems, business management, and banking— STACK THAT UP AGAINST THE ‘COMMUNITY ORGANIZER’…. Herman Cain may have the most impressive resume of anyone that has run for the presidency in the last half century.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dennis-prager-obama-damage/	“The President Who Has Done the Most Damage” by Dennis Prager	Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	"I have been broadcasting for 31 years and writing for longer than that. I do not recall ever saying on radio or in print that a president is doing lasting damage to our country. I did not like the presidencies of Jimmy Carter (the last Democrat I voted for) or Bill Clinton. Nor did I care for the “compassionate conservatism” of George W. Bush. In modern political parlance “compassionate” is a euphemism for ever-expanding government.
But I have never written or broadcast that our country was being seriously damaged by a president. So it is with great sadness that I write that President Barack Obama has done and continues to do major damage to America. The only question is whether this can ever be undone.
This is equally true domestically and internationally.
Domestically, his policies have gravely impacted the American economy.
He has overseen the weakest recovery from a recession in modern American history.
He has mired the country in unprecedented levels of debt: about $6.5 trillion dollars in five years (this after calling his predecessor “unpatriotic” for adding nearly $5 trillion in eight years).
He has fashioned a country in which more Americans now receive government aid — means-tested, let alone non-means tested — than work full-time.
He has no method of paying for this debt other than printing more money — thereby surreptitiously taxing everyone through inflation, including the poor he claims to be helping, and cheapening the dollar to the point that some countries are talking another reserve currency — and saddling the next generations with enormous debts.
With his 2,500-page Affordable Care Act, he has made it impossible for hundreds of thousands, soon millions, of Americans to keep their individual or employee-sponsored group health insurance; he has stymied American medical innovation with an utterly destructive tax on medical devices; and he has caused hundreds of thousands of workers to lose full-time jobs because of the health care costs imposed by Obamacare on employers.
His Internal Revenue Service used its unparalleled power to stymie political dissent. No one has been held accountable.
His ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were murdered by terrorists in Benghazi, Libya. No one has been blamed. The only blame the Obama administration has leveled was on a video maker in California who had nothing to do with the assault.
In this president’s White House, the buck stops nowhere.
Among presidents in modern American history, he has also been a uniquely divisive force. It began with his forcing Obamacare through Congress — the only major legislation in American history to be passed with no votes from the opposition party.
Though he has had a unique opportunity to do so, he has not only not helped heal racial tensions, he has exacerbated them. His intrusions into the Trayvon Martin affair (“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon”) and into the confrontation between a white police officer and a black Harvard professor (the police “acted stupidly”) were unwarranted, irresponsible, demagogic and, most of all, divisive.
He should have been reassuring black Americans that America is in fact the least racist country in the world — something he should know as well anybody, having been raised only by whites and being the first black elected the leader of a white-majority nation. Instead, he echoed the inflammatory speech of professional race-baiters such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.
He has also divided the country by economic class, using classic Marxist language against “the rich” and “corporate profits.”
Regarding America in the world, he has been, if possible, even more damaging. The United States is at its weakest, has fewer allies, and has less military and diplomatic influence than at any time since before World War I.
One wonders if there is a remaining ally nation that trusts him. And worse, no American enemy fears him. If you are a free movement (the democratic Iranian and Syrian oppositions) or a free country (Israel), you have little or no reason to believe that you have a steadfast ally in the United States.
Even non-democratic allies no longer trust America. Barack Obama has alienated our most important and longest standing Arab allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Both the anti-Muslim Brotherhood and the anti-Iran Arab states have lost respect for him.
And his complete withdrawal of American troops from Iraq has left that country with weekly bloodbaths.
Virtually nothing Barack Obama has done has left America or the world better since he became president. Nearly everything he has touched has been made worse.
He did, however, promise before the 2008 election that “We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.” That is the one promise he has kept.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dowd-obama/	Columnist Maureen Dowd Says Obama’s Internet Donations are Mostly From Foreign Sources	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Obama is raising campaign money handy over fist – Big Time!
 This is incredible. No wonder Obama is being so generous in helping Hillary with her campaign debts. I am greatly surprised, almost shocked, that this liberal journalist would write this column. Doesn’t she know she could be killed? She’s brave!

OBAMA’S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING 
Certainly the most interesting and potentially devastating phone call I have received during this election cycle came this week from one of the Obama’s campaign internet geeks. These are the staffers who devised Obama’s internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history – and this was all from the internet campaign. 
What I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can’t be broken and no ethics that prevail. 
Obama’s internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking , lists saved from previous party campaigns and from supporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. 
Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results. 
Then, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were “programmed” by a very sophisticated user. 
While the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these  contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia , Iran , and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia . 
Another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.  
It became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws. 
It was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway. 
This is a shocking revelation. 
We have been concerned about the legality of “bundling” contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem. 
I guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so. 
If the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen? 
I believe the Obama campaign’s internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit. It also appears the whole question of internet fund raising needs investigation by the legislature and perhaps new laws to insure it complies not only with the letter of these laws but the spirit as well.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/drjohnmccain/	Getting to Know John McCain by Karl Rove	Truth!				2015/03/17	" This is pretty amazing.
 By KARL ROVE, Mr. Rove is the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush.  
April 30, 2008  It came to me while I was having dinner with Doris Day. No, not that Doris Day, the Doris Day who is married to Col. Bud Day, Medal of Honor recipient, fighter pilot, Vietnam POW and roommate of John McCain at the Hanoi Hilton. As we ate near the Days’ home in Florida recently, I Heard things about Sen. McCain that was deeply moving.  When it comes to choosing a president, the American people want to know more about a candidate than policy positions. They want to know about character, the values ingrained in his heart. For Mr. McCain, that means they will want to know more about him personally than he has been willing to reveal.  Mr. Day relayed to me one of the stories Americans should hear.  It involves what happened to him after escaping from a North Vietnamese prison during the war.  When he was recaptured, a Vietnamese captor broke his arm and said, ‘I told you I would make you a cripple.’ The break was designed to shatter Mr. Day’s will. He had survived in prison on the hope that one day he would return to the United States and be able to fly again. To kill that hope, the Vietnamese left part of a bone sticking out of his arm, and put him in a misshapen cast. This was done so that the arm would heal at ‘a goofy angle,’ as Mr. Day explained. Had it done so, he never would have flown again. But it didn’t heal that way because of John McCain.  Risking severe punishment, Messrs, McCain and Day collected pieces of bamboo in the prison courtyard to use as a splint. Mr. McCain put Mr. Day on the floor of their cell and, using his foot, jerked the broken bone into place. Then, using strips from the bandage on his own wounded leg and the bamboo, he put Mr. Day’s splint in place.  Years later, Air Force surgeons examined Mr. Day and complimented the treatment he’d gotten from his captors. Mr. Day corrected them. It was Dr. McCain who deserved the credit. Mr. Day went on to fly again.  Another story I heard over dinner with the Days involved Mr. McCain serving as one of the three chaplains for his fellow prisoners. At one point, after being shuttled among different prisons, Mr. Day had found himself as the most senior officer at the Hanoi Hilton. So he tapped Mr. McCain to help administer religious services to the other prisoners.  Today, Mr. Day, a very active 83, still vividly recalls Mr. McCain’s sermons. ‘He remembered the Episcopal liturgy,’ Mr. Day says, ‘and sounded like a bona fide preacher.’  One of Mr. McCain’s first sermons took as its text Luke 20:25 and Matthew 22:21, ‘Render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s and unto God what is God’s.’ Mr. McCain said he and his fellow prisoners shouldn’t ask God to free them, but to help them become the best people they could be while serving as POWs. It was Caesar who put them in prison and Caesar who would get them out. Their task was to act with honor.  Another McCain story, somewhat better known, is about The Vietnamese practice of torturing him by tying his head between his ankles with his arms behind him, and then leaving him for hours. The torture so badly busted up his shoulders that to this day Mr. McCain can’t raise his arms over his head.  One night, a Vietnamese guard loosened his bonds, returning at the end of his watch to tighten them again so no one would notice. Shortly after, on Christmas Day, the same guard stood beside Mr. McCain in the prison yard and drew a cross in the sand before erasing it. Mr. McCain later said that when he returned to Vietnam for the first time after the war, the only person he really wanted to meet was that guard.  Mr. Day recalls with pride Mr. McCain stubbornly refusing to accept special treatment or curry favor to be released early, even when gravely ill. Mr. McCain knew the Vietnamese wanted the propaganda victory of the son and grandson of Navy admirals accepting special treatment. ‘He wasn’t corruptible then,’ Mr. Day says, ‘and he’s not corruptible today.’  The stories told to me by the Days involve more than wartime valor. For example, in 1991 Cindy McCain was visiting Mother Teresa’s orphanage in Bangladesh when a dying infant was thrust into her hands The orphanage could not provide the medical care needed to save her life, so Mrs. McCain brought the child home to America with her. She was met at the airport by her husband who asked what all this was about. Mrs. McCain replied that the child desperately needed surgery and years of rehabilitation. ‘I hope she can stay with us,’ she told her husband. Mr. McCain agreed. Today that child is their teenage daughter Bridget.  I was aware of this story. What I did not know, and what I learned from Doris , is that there was a second infant Mrs. McCain brought back. She ended up being adopted by a young McCain aide and his wife. ‘We were called at midnight by Cindy,’ Wes Gullett remembers, ‘and five days later we met our new daughter, Nicki at the L.A. airport wearing the only clothing Cindy could find on the trip back; a 7-Up T-shirt she bought in the Bangkok airport.’ Today, Nicki is a high school sophomore. Mr. Gullett told me, ‘I never saw a hospital bill for her care.’  A few, but not many, of the stories told to me by the Days have been written about, such as in Robert Timberg’s 1996 book ‘A Nightingale’s Song.’ But Mr. McCain rarely refers to them on the campaign trail. There is something admirable in his reticence, but he needs to overcome it. Private people like Mr. McCain are rare in politics for a reason. Candidates who are uncomfortable sharing their interior lives limit their appeal. But if Mr. McCain is to win the election this fall, he has to open up.  Americans need to know about his vision for the nation’s future, especially his policy positions and domestic reforms. They also need to learn about the moments in his life that shaped him. Mr. McCain cannot make this a biography-only campaign, but he can’t afford to make it a biography-free campaign either. Unless he opens up more, many voters will never know the experiences of his life that show his character, integrity and essential decency. These qualities mattered in America ‘s first president and will matter as Americans decide on their 44th president.  Footnote:  If you agree with me that this needs to be sent to everyone you know, so they can make better decisions as to who will be their next President, please send it to all your friends, and to those who won’t get this in their local Press!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/eddie-sessions-wsj/	Eddie Sessions and The Wall Street Journal Size Up Obama	Incorrect Authorship!				2015/03/17	"Original eRumor:
Wall Street Journal Sizes up Obama – They’ve Got Him Figured Out
A “deadly” article regarding Obama, at the Wall Street Journal, which today is the most widely circulated newspaper in America . – by Eddie Sessions:
“I have this theory about Barack Obama. I think he’s led a kind of make-believe life in which money was provided and doors were opened because at some point early on somebody or some group took a look at this tall, good looking, half-white,half-black, young man with an exotic African/Muslim name and concluded he could be guided toward a life in politics where his facile speaking skills could even put him in the White House.
In a very real way, he has been a young man in a very big hurry. Who else do you know who has written two memoirs before the age of 45? “Dreams of My Father” was published in 1995 when he was only 34 years old. The “Audacity of Hope” followed in 2006. If, indeed, he did write them himself. There are some who think that his mentor and close friend, Bill Ayers, a man who calls himself a “communist with a small ‘c'” was the real author.
His political skills consisted of rarely voting on anything that might be deemed controversial. He went from a legislator in the Illinois legislature to the Senator from that state because he had the good fortune of having Mayor Daley’s formidable political machine at his disposal.
He was in the U.S. Senate so briefly that his bid for the presidency was either an act of astonishing self-confidence or part of some greater game plan that had been determined before he first stepped foot in the Capital. How, many must wonder, was he selected to be a 2004 keynote speaker at the Democrat convention that nominated John Kerry when virtually no one had ever even heard of him before?
He outmaneuvered Hillary Clinton in primaries. He took Iowa by storm. A charming young man, an anomaly in the state with a very small black population, he oozed “cool” in a place where agriculture was the antithesis of cool. He dazzled the locals. And he had an army of volunteers drawn to a charisma that hid any real substance.
And then he had the great good fortune of having the Republicans select one of the most inept candidates for the presidency since Bob Dole. And then John McCain did something crazy.  He picked Sarah Palin, an unknown female governor from the very distant state of Alaska .. It was a ticket that was reminiscent of 1984’s Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro and they went down to defeat.
The mainstream political media fell in love with him. It was a schoolgirl crush with febrile commentators like Chris Mathews swooning then and now over the man. The venom directed against McCain and, in particular, Palin, was extraordinary.
Now, nearly a full year into his first term, all of those gilded years eading up to the White House have left him unprepared to be President. Left to his own instincts, he has a talent for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. It swiftly became a joke that he could not deliver even the briefest of statements without the ever-present Tele-Prompters.
Far worse, however, is his capacity to want to “wish away” some terrible realities, not the least of which is the Islamist intention to destroy America and enslave the West. Any student of history knows how swiftly Islam initially spread. It knocked on the doors of Europe , having gained a foothold in Spain ..
The great crowds that greeted him at home or on his campaign “world tour” were no substitute for having even the slightest grasp of history and the reality of a world filled with really bad people with really bad intentions.
Oddly and perhaps even inevitably, his political experience, a cakewalk, has positioned him to destroy the Democrat Party’s hold on power in Congress because in the end it was never about the Party. It was always about his communist ideology, learned at an early age from family, mentors, college professors, and extreme leftist friends and colleagues.
Obama is a man who could deliver a snap judgment about a Boston police officer who arrested an “obstreperous” Harvard professor-friend, but would warn Americans against “jumping to conclusions” about a mass murderer at Fort Hood who shouted “Allahu Akbar.”
The absurdity of that was lost on no one. He has since compounded this by calling the Christmas bomber “an isolated extremist” only to have to admit a day or two later that he was part of an al Qaeda plot.
He is a man who could strive to close down our detention facility at Guantanamo even though those released were known to have returned to the battlefield against America .. He could even instruct his Attorney General to afford the perpetrator of 9/11 a civil trial when no one else would ever even consider such an obscenity. And he is a man who could wait three days before having anything to say about the perpetrator of yet another terrorist attack on Americans and then have to elaborate on his remarks the following day because his first statement was so lame.
The pattern repeats itself. He either blames any problem on the Bush administration or he naively seeks to wish away the truth.
Knock, knock. Anyone home? Anyone there? Barack Obama exists only as the sock puppet of his handlers, of the people who have maneuvered and manufactured this pathetic individual’s life.
When anyone else would quickly and easily produce a birth certificate, this man has spent over a million dollars to deny access to his. Most other documents, the paper trail we all leave in our wake, have been sequestered from review. He has lived a make-believe life whose true facts remain hidden.
We laugh at the ventriloquist’s dummy, but what do you do when the dummy is President of the United States of America?”

Subject: The Mouth of the House 
I really haven’t checked this out BUT this is California – 
Facts: 
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s home House District includes San Francisco. 
Star-Kist Tuna’s headquarters are in San Francisco, Pelosi’s home district. 
Star-Kist is owned by Del Monte Foods and is a major contributor to Pelosi. 
Star-Kist is the major employer in American Samoa employing 75% of the Samoan workforce. 
Paul Pelosi, Nancy’s husband, owns $17 million dollars of Star-Kist stock. 
In January, 2007 when the minimum wage was increased from $5.15 to $7.25, Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the increase so Del Monte would not have to pay the higher wage. This would make Del Monte products less expensive than their competition’s.  
Last week when the $770B bailout bill was passed, Pelosi added an earmark to the final bill adding $33 million dollars for an “economic development credit in American Samoa”. 
Pelosi has called the Bush Administration “corrupt”. She should know! 
And, doesn’t this make you angry, while feeling hopeless?

One percent transaction tax is proposed
 President Obama’s finance team is recommending a transaction tax.
 His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transaction at any financial institution i. e. Banks, Credit Unions, extra. Any deposit you make, or move around within your account, i. e. transfer to, will have a 1% tax charged. If your pay check or your social Security or whatever is direct deposit, 1% tax charged. If you hand carry a check in to deposit, 1% tax charged, If you take cash in to deposit, 1% tax charged. This is from the man who promised that if you make under $250,000 per year, you will not see one penny of new tax. Keep your eyes and ears open, you will be amazed at what you learn.  
Other Version:
 ON JANUARY 1ST 2012, THE GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRING EVERYONE TO HAVE DIRECT DEPOSIT FOR SS CHECKS.  WONDER WHY?  Be sure to scroll down to read entire explanation 
Do you receive a retirement check from soc sec or a pension fund and have it direct deposit?? Well guess what….looks as if Obama wants to tax it 1% !!! *just one more nail in the coffin me thinks…..  All of you old coots, and old coots to be had better read this. This Obama gang is diabolical. Is your Soc. Sec. check on direct deposit?  WAKE UP AMERICA 
1% tax on all bank transactions HR4646 
Watch for this AFTER November elections; remember this BEFORE you VOTE in case you think Obama’s looking out for your best interest. 
1% tax on all bank transactions HR 4646 
This government just cannot think of enough ways to hurt the American people! I sure hope this dies!!!!! 
FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW! 
1% tax on all bank transactions HR 4646 – ANOTHER NEW OBAMA TAX SLIPPED IN WHILE WE WERE ASLEEP. Checked this on snopes, it’s true! Check out HR 4646. 
President Obama’s finance team is recommending a one percent (1%) transaction fee (TAX). Obama’s plan is to sneak it in after the November elections to keep it under the radar. 
This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution – banks, credit unions, savings and loans, etc. Any deposit you make, or even a transfer within your account, will have a 1% tax charged. ~If your paycheck or your social security or whatever is direct deposit, it will get a 1% tax charged for the transaction. ~If your paycheck is $1000, then you will pay Obama $10 just for the privilege of depositing your paycheck in your bank. Even if you hand carry your paycheck or any check into your bank for a deposit, 1% tax will be charged. ~You receive a $5,000 stock dividend from your broker, Obama takes $50 just to allow you to deposit that check in the bank.. ~If you take $1,000 cash to deposit at your bank, 1% tax will be charged. 
Mind you, this is from the man who promised that, if you make under $250,000 per year, you will not see one penny of new tax. Keep your eyes and ears open, you will be amazed at what you learn about this guy’s under-the-table moves to increase the number of ways you are taxed.

~Oh, and by the way, if you receive a refund from the IRS next year and you have it direct deposited or you walk in to deposit that check, you guessed it. You will pay a 1% charge of that money just for putting it in your bank. Remember, any money, cash, check or whatever, no matter where it came from, you will pay a 1% fee if you put it in the bank. 
Some will say, oh well, it’s just 1%. Are you kidding me? It’s a 1% tax increase across the board. Remember, once the tax is there, they can also raise it at will. And if anyone protests, they will just say, “oh,that’s not really a tax, it’s a user fee”! Think this is no big deal? Go back and look at the transactions you made from last year’s banking statements. Then add the total of all those transactions and deduct 1%. Still think it’s no big deal?  Here is what snopes has to say about it. (FB)

CHARLOTTE,North Carolina (9/11/12) When the DNC came to Charlotte, area churches, 100 of them, offered hospitality, not knowing how much the Dems hate God and would actually boo God at the convention. They had no idea how that hatred would be directed at them and their churches. 
The Sunday before the DNC, over 9000 people had come together to pray for the convention. Then, wanting to extend hospitality to the visitors to their city, 56 of the churches set out to “Adopt-a-Delegation.” 
They put together gift baskets featuring Carolina Pralines and a letter welcoming them to the city and offering assistance in transportation, childcare or spiritual matters. 
According to writer, Todd Starnes, The DNC banned the churches from distributing the gift baskets to delegates because, DNC said, the congregations hold values that are contrary to the party platform. Read that carefully. 
David Benham, one of the organizers of the outreach said, “We were just trying to display Southern hospitality.” DNC officials, however, conveyed to city leaders that the Christians would not be allowed to present their gift baskets.  
Even the Charlotte Mayor’s office jumped in to tell the churches not to participate, saying that their views on women’s rights are contrary to the platform. That’s right….the same platform that booed God later. 
Benham then asked if they could send welcome letters to the delegates. Again, the DNC refused, because, they said, “The churches hold pro-life values.” 
The baskets did not contain a single political or pro-life message. They just wanted to give them regional candles and a welcome letter. The DNC refused to return numerous phone calls seeking comment. 
But it gets worse. When a gathering of 200 Muslims showed up to pray for the convention, the Dems welcomed them with open arms and the liberal media gave extensive national coverage. 
It is ironic that this day, in the shadow of that Islamic prayer event, we commemorate the greatest tragedy in American History, when Muslims attacked America on September 11, 2001, brutally killing thousands.of innocent people. 
Muslims who publicly state their hatred of our country with fierce determination to kill us all and put America under Sharia Law, are welcomed by the Democratic Party while Christians are pushed out of sight like criminals because they respect life and hold family values. 
These are the same Democrats who want you to vote them into office to direct the United States of America and every life from beginning to end. It is obvious that we must not let this happen. 
Our thanks to Rev. Ed Berkey (retired) who alerted us to this story.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/deepak-chopra-obama-palin/	Deepak Chopra Personal Comments about Obama, and Palin	Truth!   				2015/03/17	" Obama and The Palin Effect From: Deepak Chopra | Posted: Friday, September 5th, 2008
 Sometimes politics has the uncanny effect of mirroring the national psyche even when nobody intended to do that. This is perfectly illustrated by the rousing effect that Gov. Sarah Palin had on the Republican convention in Minneapolis this week. On the surface, she outdoes former Vice President Dan Quayle as an unlikely choice, given her negligent parochial expertise in the complex affairs of governing. Her state of Alaska has less than 700,000 residents, which reduces the job of governor to the scale of running one-tenth of New York City. By comparison, Rudy Giuliani is a towering international figure. Palin’s pluck has been admired, and her forthrightness, but her real appeal goes deeper.
She is the reverse of Barack Obama, in essence his shadow, deriding his idealism and exhorting people to obey their worst impulses. In psychological terms the shadow is that part of the psyche that hides out of sight, countering our aspirations, virtue, and vision with qualities we are ashamed to face: anger, fear, revenge, violence, selfishness, and suspicion of ‘the other.’ For millions of Americans, Obama triggers those feelings, but they don’t want to express them. He is calling for us to reach for our higher selves, and frankly, that stirs up hidden reactions of an unsavory kind. (Just to be perfectly clear, I am not making a verbal play out of the fact that Sen. Obama is black. The shadow is a metaphor widely in use before his arrival on the scene.)
I recognize that psychological analysis of politics is usually not welcome by the public, but I believe such a perspective can be helpful here to understand Palin’s message. In her acceptance speech Gov. Palin sent a rousing call to those who want to celebrate their resistance to change and a higher vision.
Look at what she stands for: –Small town values — a denial of America’s global role, a return to petty, small-minded parochialism. –Ignorance of world affairs — a repudiation of the need to repair America’s image abroad. –Family values — a code for walling out anybody who makes a claim for social justice. Such strangers, being outside the family, don’t need to be heeded. –Rigid stands on guns and abortion — a scornful repudiation that these issues can be negotiated with those who disagree. -Patriotism — the usual fallback in a failed war. –‘Reform’ — an italicized term, since in addition to cleaning out corruption and excessive spending, one also throws out anyone who doesn’t fit your ideology.
Palin reinforces the overall message of the reactionary right, which has been in play since 1980, that social justice is liberal-radical, that minorities and immigrants, being different from ‘us’ pure American types, can be ignored, that progressivism takes too much effort and globalism is a foreign threat. The radical right marches under the banners of ‘I’m all right, Jack,’ and ‘Why change? Everything’s OK as it is.’ The irony, of course, is that Gov. Palin is a woman and a reactionary at the same time. She can add mom to apple pie on her resume, while blithely reversing forty years of feminist progress. The irony is superficial; there are millions of women who stand on the side of conservatism, however obviously they are voting against their own good. The Republicans have won multiple national elections by raising shadow issues based on fear, rejection, hostility to change, and narrow-mindedness.
Obama’s call for higher ideals in politics can’t be seen in a vacuum. The shadow is real; it was bound to respond. Not just conservatives possess a shadow — we all do. So what comes next is a contest between the two forces of progress and inertia. Will the shadow win again, or has its furtive appeal become exhausted? No one can predict. The best thing about Gov. Palin is that she brought this conflict to light, which makes the upcoming debate honest. It would be a shame to elect another Reagan, whose smiling persona was a stalking horse for the reactionary forces that have brought us to the demoralized state we are in. We deserve to see what we are getting, without disguise.

Posted on August 27, 2012 at 8:25pm by Erica Ritz

The Democratic National Committee is raising a number of eyebrows after choosing to proceed with hosting Islamic “Jumah” prayers for two hours on the Friday of its convention, though it denied a Catholic cardinal’s request to say a prayer at the same event.
The event is being promoted on the official Charlottein2012.com page.
Watch the promotional video, via the Bureau of Muslim Affairs, which is partnering with the DNC for the event.
The first two minutes are rather dry, but around 2:04 a muezzin sings the call to prayer with an American flag background, and the video “picks up” considerably:
 
In particular, the event will target the Patriot Act, the NYPD, the National Defense Authorization Act, and anti-Shariah sentiment.
And while Muslim-Americans undeniably face distinct challenges, those who are well-informed on the dangers of radical Islam are expressing their doubts about the event.
(Photo: Bureau of Indigenous Muslim Affairs)
The leaders of this event – Jibril Hough and Imam Siraj Wahhaj [are not] moderates. They are radicals. These individuals embrace Islamist supremacy and have demonstrated support for radical ideologies.
A quick Google search by the DNC would have shown them that Hough and Wahhaj are leaders in the separatist American Islamist movement. While they may be able to get a few thousand Muslims to attend the event, they are NOT going to be mainstream Muslims. Most will likely come from Hough and Wahhaj’s radical networks that have long been entrenched in the Charlotte area. Make no mistake they are part of the Islamist movement.

Their jummah (group) prayer is…about empowering their Islamist and MB sympathetic groups into the very fabric of the political system so that Americans become anesthetized. We need American Muslims to speak up and marginalize these radicals. The DNC needs to understand and reject them because of their radical history and ideas.
(Photo: Bureau of Indigenous Muslim Affairs)
The mosque of Jibril Hough, mentioned by Dr. Jasser, is owned by the North American Islamic Trust, which was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation trial as one of the entities “who are and/or were members of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood.”
Siraj Wahhaj, the “Grand Imam” for Jumah at the DNC, is often considered a “moderate” because he was the first Muslim to give an invocation in the U.S. Congress, but as Robert Spencer notes, he has a number of troubling ties to dangerous radicals. In the early 1990′s the man reportedly sponsored talks by “the Blind Sheikh” Omar Abdel-Rahman in New York and New Jersey mosques, and told his followers that the United States will fall unless it “accepts the Islamic agenda.”
Wahhaj elaborated, according to bestselling author Brigitte Gabriel, to say: “If only Muslims were clever politically, they could take over the United States and replace its constitutional government with a caliphate.”
He continued: “Take my word. If 6-8 million Muslims unite in America, the country will come to us.”
When an imam like Siraj Wahhaj says “it his duty and our duty as Muslims to replace the US Constitution with the Quran…we need to speak up!” Dr. Jasser reiterated in response, adding that Americans “should be concerned” if this is who the DNC is “consorting with.”
Robert Spencer speculates that the Democrat National Committee is simply so “in thrall with multiculturalism” that “few, if any” are even aware of the radical connections.
“To raise any concerns about such a speaker would be ‘Islamophobic,’ violating every rule of the anti-American, anti-Western ethos that prevails among so many Democrats today,” Spencer writes.
He concluded: “There is about as much chance of that as there is of the Democrats ditching Obama and nominating David Horowitz as their candidate for President of the United States.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/democrats-lawyers/	The Democratic Party Has Become the Lawyer’s Party	 Commentary! 				2015/03/17	"The Lawyers’ Party  By Bruce Walker 
The Democratic Party has become the Lawyers’ Party .  Barack Obama is a lawyer.  Michelle Obama is a lawyer.  Hillary Clinton is a lawyer.  Bill Clinton is a lawyer.  John Edwards is a lawyer.  Elizabeth Edwards is a lawyer.  Every Democrat nominee since 1984 went to law school (although Gore did not graduate).  Every Democrat vice presidential nominee since 1976, except for Lloyd Bentsen, went to law school.  Look at leaders of the Democrat Party in Congress:  Harry Reid is a lawyer.  Nancy Pelosi is a lawyer. 
The Republican Party is different.  President Bush is a businessman.  Vice President Cheney is a businessman.  The leaders of the Republican Revolution:  Newt Gingrich was a history professor.  Tom Delay was an exterminator. Dick Armey was an economist.  House Minority Leader Boehner was a plastic manufacturer.  The former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is a heart surgeon.  Who was the last Republican president who was a lawyer? Gerald Ford, who left office 31 years ago and who barely won the Republican nomination as a sitting president, running against Ronald Reagan in 1976. 
The Republican Party is made up of real people doing real work, who are often the targets of lawyers. 
The Democrat Party is made up of lawyers. Democrats mock and scorn men who create wealth, like Bush and Cheney, or who heal the sick, like Frist, or who immerse themselves in history, like Gingrich. 
 The Lawyers’ Party sees these sorts of people, who provide goods and services that people want, as the enemies of America . And, so we have seen the procession of official enemies, in the eyes of the Lawyers’ Party, grow.. 
 Against whom do Hillary and Obama rail? Pharmaceutical companies, oil companies, hospitals, manufacturers, fast food restaurant chains, large retail businesses, bankers, and anyone producing anything of value in our nation. 
 This is the natural consequence of viewing everything through the eyes of lawyers.  Lawyers solve problems by successfully representing their clients, in this case the American people.  Lawyers seek to have new laws passed, they seek to win lawsuits, they press appellate courts to overturn precedent, and lawyers always parse language to favor their side. 
 Confined to the narrow practice of law, that is fine. But it is an awful way to govern a great nation.  When politicians as lawyers begin to view some Americans as clients and other Americans as opposing parties, then the role of the legal system in our life becomes all-consuming. Some Americans become “adverse parties” of our very government. We are not all litigants in some vast social class-action suit. We are citizens of a republic that promises us a great deal of freedom from laws, from courts, and from lawyers. 
 Today, we are drowning in laws; we are contorted by judicial decisions; we are driven to distraction by omnipresent lawyers in all parts of our once private lives. America has a place for laws and lawyers, but that place is modest and reasonable, not vast and unchecked. When the most important decision for our next president is whom he will appoint to the Supreme Court, the role of lawyers and the law in America is too big. When lawyers use criminal prosecution as a continuation of politics by other means, as happened in the lynching of Scooter Libby and Tom Delay, then the power of lawyers in America is too great. When House Democrats sue America in order to hamstring our efforts to learn what our enemies are planning to do to us, then the role of litigation in America has become crushing. 
 We cannot expect the Lawyers’ Party to provide real change, real reform or real hope in America Most Americans know that a republic in which every major government action must be blessed by nine unelected judges is not what Washington intended in 1789. Most Americans grasp that we cannot fight a war when ACLU lawsuits snap at the heels of our defenders. Most Americans intuit that more lawyers and judges will not restore declining moral values or spark the spirit of enterprise in our economy. 
 Perhaps Americans will understand that change cannot be brought to our nation by those lawyers who already largely dictate American society and business. Perhaps Americans will see that hope does not come from the mouths of lawyers but from personal dreams nourished by hard work. Perhaps Americans will embrace the truth that more lawyers with more power will only make our problems worse. 
 The United States has 5% of the world’s population and 66% of the world’s lawyers! Tort (Legal) reform legislation has been introduced in congress several times in the last several years to limit punitive damages in ridiculous lawsuits such as “spilling hot coffee on yourself and suing the establishment that sold it to you” and also to limit punitive damages in huge medical malpractice lawsuits. This legislation has continually been blocked from even being voted on by the Democrat Party. When you see that 97% of the political contributions from the American Trial Lawyers Association goes to the Democrat Party, then you realize who is responsible for our medical and product costs being so high!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dennis-miller-on-middle-east/	Dennis Miller’s Commentary on the Middle East Situation	Incorrect Authorship!				2015/03/17	"Israel Problem in a Nutshell
 Comments by Dennis Miller:
 For those of you who don’t like Dennis Miller, who is not Jewish, you may want to reconsider after reading his comments that follow.
 For those who don’t know, Dennis Miller is a comedian who has a show called Dennis Miller Live on HBO. Although he is not Jewish, he recently had the following to say about the Middle East situation:
 A brief overview of the situation is always valuable, so as a service to all Americans who still don’t get it, I now offer you the story of the Middle East in just a few paragraphs, which is all you Really need.
 Here we go in Dennis Miller’s own words:
 Let me share my current thoughts on the blockade of Gaza by Egypt and Israel. The Palestinians want their own country. There’s just one thing about that: There are no Palestinians. It’s a made up word. Israel was called Palestine for two thousand years. Like  ‘Wiccan,’ ‘Palestinian’ sounds ancient but is really a modern invention. Before the Israelis won the land in the 1967 war, Gaza was Owned by Egypt, the West Bank was owned by Jordan, and there were no Palestinians.’
 As soon as the Jews took over and started growing oranges as big as basketballs, what do you know, say hello to the ‘Palestinians, weeping for their deep bond with their lost ‘land’ and ‘nation.’ So for the sake of honesty, let’s not use the word ‘Palestinian’ any more to describe these delightful folks, who dance for joy at our deaths until someone Points out they’re being taped. Instead, let’s call them what they are: ‘Other Arabs Who Can’t Accomplish Anything In Life And Would Rather Wrap Themselves In The Seductive Melodrama Of Eternal Struggle And Death. ‘ I know that’s a bit unwieldy to expect to see on CNN. How about this, then: ‘Adjacent Jew-Haters.’ Okay, so the Adjacent Jew-Haters want their own country. 
Oops, just one more thing: No, they don’t. They could’ve had their own country. Anytime in the last thirty years, especially several years ago at Camp David. But If you have your own country, you have to have traffic lights and garbage trucks. And Chambers of Commerce, and, worse, you actually have to figure out some way to make a living. That’s no fun. No, they want what all the other Jew-Haters in the region want: Israel. They also want a big pile of dead Jews, of course that’s where the Real fun is — but mostly they want Israel.
 Why? For one thing, trying to destroy Israel – or ‘The Zionist Entity’ as their Textbooks call it — for the last fifty years has allowed the rulers of Arab Countries to divert the attention of their own people away from the fact that they’re the blue-ribbon most illiterate, poorest, and tribally backward on God’s Earth, and if you’ve ever been around God’s Earth, you know that’s really saying something.
 It makes me roll my eyes every time one of our pundits waxes poetic about the great history and culture of the Muslim Mid east. Unless I’m missing something, the Arabs haven’t given anything to the world since Algebra, and, by the way, thanks a hell of a lot for that one.
 Chew this around and spit it out: Five hundred million Arabs; five Million Jews.
 Think of all the Arab countries as a football field, and Israel as a pack of matches sitting in the middle of it. And now these same folks swear that if Israel gives them half of that pack of matches, everyone will be pals.
 Really? Wow, what neat news. Hey, but what about the string of wars to obliterate the tiny country and the constant din of rabid blood oaths to drive very Jew into the sea? Oh, that? We were just kidding.
 My friend, Kevin Rooney, made a gorgeous point the other day: Just reverse the Numbers. Imagine five hundred million Jews and five million Arabs. I was stunned at the simple brilliance of it. Can anyone picture the Jews strapping belts of razor blades and dynamite to themselves? Of course not. Or marshaling every fiber and force at his or her disposal for generations to drive a tiny Arab State into the sea? Nonsense. Or dancing for joy at the murder of Innocents? Impossible. Or spreading and believing horrible lies about the Arabs baking their bread with the blood of children? Disgusting.
No, as you know, left to themselves in a world of peace, the worst Jews would ever do to people is debate them to death.
 However, in any big-picture strategy, there’s always a danger of losing moral weight. We’ve already lost some. After September 11 th our president told the world and us he was going to root out all terrorists and the countries that supported them. Beautiful. Then the Israelis, after months and months of having the equivalent of an Oklahoma City every week (and then every day) start to do the same thing we did, and we tell them to show restraint.
 If America were being attacked with an Oklahoma City every day, we would all very shortly be screaming for the administration to just be done with it and kill everything south of the Mediterranean and east of the Jordan.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/healthcare-bill-reid-clause/	Clause in the Health Care Bill That Prevents any Changes	Opinion!				2015/03/17	"The impudent tyranny of Sen. Harry Reid Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is proving once again the maxim that darkness hates the light.
Buried in his massive amendment to the Senate version of Obamacare is Reid’s anti-democratic poison pill designed to prevent any future Congress from repealing the central feature of this monstrous legislation!
Beginning on page 1,000 of the measure, Section 3403 reads in part: “. it shall not be in order in the Senate or the House of Representatives to consider any bill, resolution, amendment or conference report that would repeal or otherwise change this subsection.”
In other words, if President Barack Obama signs this measure into law, no future Senate or House will be able to change a single word of Section 3403, regardless whether future Americans or their representatives in Congress wish otherwise!!
Note that the subsection at issue here concerns the regulatory power of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board (IMAB) to “reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending.”
That is precisely the kind of open-ended grant of regulatory power that effectively establishes the IMAB as the ultimate arbiter of the cost, quality and quantity of health care to be made available to the American people. And Reid wants the decisions of this group of unelected federal bureaucrats to be untouchable for all time.
No wonder the majority leader tossed aside assurances that senators and the public would have at least 72 hours to study the text of the final Senate version of Obamacare before the critical vote on cloture. And no wonder Reid was so desperate to rush his amendment through the Senate, even scheduling the key tally on it at 1 a.m., while America slept.
True to form, Reid wanted to keep his Section 3403 poison pill secret for as long as possible, just as he negotiated his bribes for the votes of Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind closed doors.
The final Orwellian touch in this subversion of democratic procedure is found in the ruling of the Reid-controlled Senate Parliamentarian that the anti-repeal provision is not a change in Senate rules, but rather of Senate “procedures.” Why is that significant?
Because for 200 years, changes in the Senate’s standing rules have required approval by two-thirds of those voting, or 67 votes rather than the 60 Reid’s amendment received.
Reid has flouted two centuries of standing Senate rules to pass a measure in the dead of night that no senator has read, and part of which can never be changed. If this is not tyranny, then what is?

Are you ready For this? “ERIC HOLDER!!!” Remember Harry Reid changed the rules of the Senate so the Republicans couldn’t stop it either. What then people? What do we do Then if this happens? This was a discussion topic on “The Five” today. It was brought up By Dana Perino, Bush’s former press secretary. Bob Beckle also Indicated this possibility on the show. I’ll tell you what. If Obama wants a communist long term legacy, Putting Eric Holder on the Supreme Court would do it. That Possibility should scare the crap out of all of us. Can you say “Good-bye 2nd Amendment” for starters?” Our only hope is that no one on the Supreme Court resigns or retires Before January 2015 and that Republicans take the senate in the November, 2014 elections. That is our ONLY hope. If we didn’t already Have an incentive to vote, this sure as hell is a huge one.

Subject: WW II Battleship sailor tells Obama to shape up or ship out ! 

WW II Battleship sailor tells Obama to shape up or ship out ! 
This venerable and much honored WW II vet is well known in Hawaii for his seventy-plus years of service to patriotic organizations and causes all over the country. A humble man without a political bone in his body, he has never spoken out before about a government official, until now. 
He dictated this letter to a friend, signed it and mailed it to the president. 
Dear President Obama, 


My name is Harold Estes, approaching 95 on December 13 of this year. People meeting me for the first time don’t believe my age because I remain wrinkle free and pretty much mentally alert..  


I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1934 and served proudly before, during and after WW II retiring as a Master Chief Bos’n Mate. Now I live in a “rest home” located on the western end of Pearl Harbor, allowing me to keep alive the memories of 23 years of service to my country. 


One of the benefits of my age, perhaps the only one, is to speak my mind, blunt and direct even to the head man. 


So here goes. 


I am amazed, angry and determined not to see my country die before I do, but you seem hell bent not to grant me that wish. 


I can’t figure out what country you are the president of. 
You fly around the world telling our friends and enemies despicable lies like: 
” We’re no longer a Christian nation” 
” America is arrogant” – (Your wife even 
announced to the world,”America is mean- 
spirited. ” Please tell her to try preaching  
that nonsense to 23 generations of our 
war dead buried all over the globe who 
died for no other reason than to free a 
whole lot of strangers from tyranny and 
hopelessness.) 
I’d say shame on the both of you, but I don’t think you like America, nor do I see an ounce of gratefulness in anything you do, for the obvious gifts this country has given you. To be without shame or gratefulness is a dangerous thing for a man sitting in the White House. 


After 9/11 you said,” America hasn’t lived up to her ideals.” 


Which ones did you mean? Was it the notion of personal liberty that 11,000 farmers and shopkeepers died for to win independence from the British? Or maybe the ideal that no man should be a slave to another man, that 500,000 men died for in the Civil War? I hope you didn’t mean the ideal 470,000 fathers, brothers, husbands, and a lot of fellas I knew personally died for in WWII, because we felt real strongly about not letting any nation push us around, because we stand for freedom. 


I don’t think you mean the ideal that says equality is better than discrimination. You know the one that a whole lot of white people understood when they helped to get you elected. 


Take a little advice from a very old geezer, young man. 


Shape up and start acting like an American. If you don’t, I’ll do what I can to see you get shipped out of that fancy rental on Pennsylvania Avenue.. You were elected to lead not to bow, apologize and kiss the hands of murderers and corrupt leaders who still treat their people like slaves. 


And just who do you think you are telling the American people not to jump to conclusions and condemn that Muslim major who killed 13 of his fellow soldiers and wounded dozens more. You mean you don’t want us to do what you did when that white cop used force to subdue that black college professor in Massachusetts, who was putting up a fight? You don’t mind offending the police calling them stupid but you don’t want us to offend Muslim fanatics by calling them what they are, terrorists. 


One more thing. I realize you never served in the military and never had to defend your country with your life, but you’re the Commander-in-Chief now, son. Do your job. When your battle-hardened field General asks you for 40,000 more troops to complete the mission, give them to him. But if you’re not in this fight to win, then get out. The life of one American soldier is not worth the best political strategy you’re thinking of. 


You could be our greatest president because you face the greatest challenge ever presented to any president. 
You’re not going to restore American greatness by bringing back our bloated economy. That’s not our greatest threat. Losing the heart and soul of who we are as Americans is our big fight now. 
And I sure as hell don’t want to think my president is the enemy in this final battle. 


Sincerely, 
Harold B. Estes 


When a 95 year old hero of the “the Greatest Generation” 
stands up and speaks out like this, I think we owe it 
to him to send his words to as many Americans as 
we can. Please pass it on.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-general-greene/	President Obama Not Represented at Memorial for General Harold Greene	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"TO MY FRIENDS OF KNOWN DIFFERENT POLITICAL AFFILIATION THAN ME, DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT CONSIDERING THIS MESSAGE POLITICAL. IT IS ABOUT ONE OF MANY DISRESPECTFUL ACTS OF OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO VETERANS OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY, MANY OF WHOM HAVE MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY FREE AND SAFE TO IT’S CITIZENS.
 Commander-in-Chief Obama and General Greene who died in Afghanistan
Two star Major General Harold Greene was killed in Afghanistan on August 8, 2014 while serving his country in pride for 34 years. As of 1972, he was the highest ranking officer in the military killed in action since the Vietnam war.
He was buried August 14 in the Arlington National Cemetery. Neither the President, Vice President, Secretary of State nor Secretary of Defense attended the funeral.
Our Commander-in-Chief has not mentioned anything in regards to this highly decorated soldier yet he spoke highly of Robin Williams who committed suicide. He was on vacation, playing golf at Martha’s Vineyard. No flags were ordered to half mast, yet they were for Whitney Houston who also committed suicide.
I FIND THIS HIGHLY OFFENSIVE AND DISRESPECTFUL TO ALL VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY!!! BUT THEN AGAIN, WHY DOES THIS NOT SURPRISE ME.
Do what you want with this e-mail, but I am sending it on..
Other Versions:
This is unbelievable!
By all accounts, Harold was a bright child. He grew up in America. He went to school and had a bright future ahead of him.
Harold’s full life was cut short in a violent moment.While few people had ever heard of Harold before his death, many did afterwards. And in death, something shocking happened.
What was so shocking, especially when it is compared to the death of someone else recently in the news?
Harold is Harold Greene, Major General United States Army.
On August 5th, General Greene was killed by a Taliban terrorist. He was returned to America with full military honors. It has been a tradition that the President attends the funeral of flag officers killed in the line of duty. Richard Nixon attended the funeral of a Major General killed in Vietnam and George W. Bush attended the funeral of Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, who was killed in the 9/11 attacks.
While Major General Greene was buried, Barack Obama was golfing. The Vice President wasn’t there either. Neither was the Secretary of Defense. Flags were not even lowered to half staff.
Four days after Harold Greene gave his life for America, Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson Missouri.
It is safe to say, Brown was at best a thug.
The media has repeatedly shown photos of Brown flashing gang signs. Some media outlets have even associated him with a specific gang. In the minutes before his death, Brown committed a robbery at a local convenience store. According to other reports, Brown struck officer Darren Wilson and shattered his orbital bone.
Obama is sending a three-person delegation to Michael Brown’s funeral.
Obama would not attend the funeral of the highest ranking military officer killed in the line of duty since 9/11, yet he will send a delegation to the funeral of a thug.
When Margaret Thatcher, one of America’s staunchest allies and Ronald Reagan’s partner in bringing down Soviet communism, died Obama sent only a small low-level delegation to her funeral. The snub was not missed by the British.
When Chris Kyle, the most lethal American sniper in history was murdered, there was no expression of sympathy from the White House. There was no White House delegation at his funeral.
American heroes die and Obama goes to the golf course.
A thug dies and he gets a White House delegation.
No wonder real Americans hold Obama in contempt.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/nyt-fannie-mae-clinton-1999/	New York Times Article Predicted 2008 Bail Out in 1999	Truth!				2015/03/17	"September 30, 1999
 Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending  -By Steven A. Holmes  
 In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.  
The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets — including the New York metropolitan region — will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.  
Fannie Mae, the nation’s biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.  
In addition, banks, thrift institutions and mortgage companies have been pressing Fannie Mae to help them make more loans to so-called subprime borrowers. These borrowers whose incomes, credit ratings and savings are not good enough to qualify for conventional loans, can only get loans from finance companies that charge much higher interest rates — anywhere from three to four percentage points higher than conventional loans.  
”Fannie Mae has expanded home ownership for millions of families in the 1990’s by reducing down payment requirements,” said Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae’s chairman and chief executive officer. ”Yet there remain too many borrowers whose credit is just a notch below what our underwriting has required who have been relegated to paying significantly higher mortgage rates in the so-called subprime market.”  
Demographic information on these borrowers is sketchy. But at least one study indicates that 18 percent of the loans in the subprime market went to black borrowers, compared to 5 per cent of loans in the conventional loan market.  
In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980’s.  
”From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us,” said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.  ”If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.”  
Under Fannie Mae’s pilot program, consumers who qualify can secure a mortgage with an interest rate one percentage point above that of a conventional, 30-year fixed rate mortgage of less than $240,000 — a rate that currently averages about 7.76 per cent. If the borrower makes his or her monthly payments on time for two years, the one percentage point premium is dropped.  
Fannie Mae, the nation’s biggest underwriter of home mortgages, does not lend money directly to consumers. Instead, it purchases loans that banks make on what is called the secondary market. By expanding the type of loans that it will buy, Fannie Mae is hoping to spur banks to make more loans to people with less-than-stellar credit ratings.  
Fannie Mae officials stress that the new mortgages will be extended to all potential borrowers who can qualify for a mortgage. But they add that the move is intended in part to increase the number of minority and low income home owners who tend to have worse credit ratings than non-Hispanic whites.  
Home ownership has, in fact, exploded among minorities during the economic boom of the 1990’s. The number of mortgages extended to Hispanic applicants jumped by 87.2 per cent from 1993 to 1998, according to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. During that same period the number of African Americans who got mortgages to buy a home increased by 71.9 per cent and the number of Asian Americans by 46.3 per cent.  
In contrast, the number of non-Hispanic whites who received loans for homes increased by 31.2 per cent.  
Despite these gains, home ownership rates for minorities continue to lag behind non-Hispanic whites, in part because blacks and Hispanics in particular tend to have on average worse credit ratings.  
In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed that by the year 2001, 50 percent of Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s portfolio be made up of loans to low and moderate-income borrowers. Last year, 44 percent of the loans Fannie Mae purchased were from these groups.  
The change in policy also comes at the same time that HUD is investigating allegations of racial discrimination in the automated underwriting systems used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine the credit-worthiness of credit applicants.

Thomas Jefferson – Words of Wisdom 


1. When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe.  Thomas Jefferson
2. The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.   Thomas Jefferson
3. It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on would save one-half the wars of the world. Thomas Jefferson
4. I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them. Thomas Jefferson
5. My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. Thomas Jefferson
6. No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. Thomas Jefferson
7. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government. Thomas Jefferson
8. The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. Thomas Jefferson
9. To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical. Thomas Jefferson
And One Very Interesting Quote 
In light of the present financial crisis, it’s interesting to read what Thomas Jefferson said in 1802: 


‘I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/jeremiah-wright/	Military Service of Jeremiah Wright	Truth!				2015/03/17	"  
A Real Man:
In 1961, a young African-American man, after hearing President John F. Kennedy’s challenge to, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,’ gave up his student deferment, left college in Virginia and voluntarily joined the Marines. 
In 1963, this man, having completed his two years of service in the Marines, volunteered again to become a Navy corpsman. (They provide medical assistance to the Marines as well as to Navy personnel.)
 The man did so well in corpsman school that he was the valedictorian and became a cardiopulmonary technician. Not surprisingly, he was assigned to the Navy’s premier medical facility, Bethesda Naval Hospital, as a member of the commander in chief’s medical team, and helped care for President Lyndon B. Johnson after his 1966 surgery. 
For his service on the team, which he left in 1967, the White House awarded him three letters of commendation. 
What is even more remarkable is that this man entered the Marines and Navy not many years after the two branches began to become integrated. 
While this young man was serving six years on active duty, Vice President Dick Cheney, who was born the same year as the Marine/sailor, received five deferments, four for being an undergraduate and graduate student and one for being a prospective father. 
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, both five years younger than the African-American youth, used their student deferments to stay in college until 1968. Both then avoided going on active duty through family connections. 
Who is the real patriot? The young man who interrupted his studies to serve his country for six years or our three political leaders who beat the system? Are the patriots the people who actually sacrifice something or those who merely talk about their love of the country? 
After leaving the service of his country, the young African-American finished his final year of college, entered the seminary, was ordained as a minister, and eventually became pastor of a large church in one of America’s biggest cities. Who was this man?


This man is Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the retiring pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ.

At 5, began studying under his cousin’s tutor. 
At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. 
At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages. 
At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand while writing the same in Latin with the other. 
At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. 
At 23, started his own law practice. 
At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. 
At 31, wrote the widely circulated “Summary View of the Rights of British America” And retired from his law practice.
 At 32, was a Delegate to the Second Continental Congress. 
At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence . 
At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ‘s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. 
At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia succeeding Patrick Henry.

At 81, almost single-handedly created the University of Virginia and served as its first president. 
At 83, died on the 50th anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence along with John Adams. 
Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, his laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today. Jefferson really knew his stuff. A voice from the past to lead us in the future: 
John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: “This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hollis-opinion-obamacare/	“We Are Not SUBJECTS” by Professor Laura Hollis	 Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	"Opinion from Professor Laura Hollis-Notre Dame
The unveiling of the dictatorial debacle that is Obamacare absolutely flabbergasts me. It is stunning on so many levels, but the most shocking aspect of it for me is watching millions of free Americans stand idly by while this man, his minions in Congress and his cheerleaders in the press systematically dismantle our Constitution, steal our money, and crush our freedoms.
The President, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid (with no small help from Justice John Roberts) take away our health care, and we allow it. They take away our insurance, and we allow it. They take away our doctors, and we allow it. They charge us thousands of dollars more a year, and we allow it. They make legal products illegal, and we allow it. They cripple our businesses, and we allow it. They announce by fiat that we must ignore our most deeply held beliefs – and we allow it.
Where is your spine, America?
Yes, I know people are complaining. I read the news on the internet. I read blogs. I have a Twitter feed. So what? People in the Soviet Union complained. People in Cuba complain. People in China complain (quietly). Complaining isn’t the same thing as doing anything about it. In fact, much of the complaining that we hear sounds like resignation: Wow. This sucks. Oh well, this is the way things are. Too bad.
Perhaps you need reminding of a few important facts. Here goes:
1. The President is not a king
Barack Obama does not behave like a President, an elected official, someone who realizes that he works for us. He behaves like a king, a dictator – someone who believes that his own pronouncements have the force of law, and who thinks he can dispense with the law’s enforcement when he deigns to do so. And those of us who object? How dare we? Racists!
And while he moves steadily “forward” with his plans to “fundamentally transform” the greatest country in human history, he distracts people with cheap, meaningless trivialities, like “free birth control pills”! (In fact, let’s face it: this administration’s odd obsession with sex in general – Birth control! Abortion! Sterilization! Gay guys who play basketball! — is just plain weird. Since when did the leader of the free world care so much about how people have sex, who they have it with, and what meds they use when they have it? Does he have nothing more important to concern himself with?)
2. It isn’t just a failed software program; it is a failed philosophy
People are marveling that Healthcare.gov was such a spectacular failure. Well, if one is only interested in it as a product launch, I’ve explained some of the reasons for that here. But the larger point is that it isn’t a software failure, or even a product failure; it is a philosophy failure.
I have said this before: Obama is not a centrist; he is a central planner. And this – all of it: the disastrous computer program, the hundreds of millions of dollars wasted, the lies, the manipulation of public opinion, the theft of the public’s money and property, and freedom (read insurance, and premiums, and doctors) — IS what central planning looks like.
The central premise of central planning is that a handful of wunderkinds with your best interests at heart (yeah, right) know better than you what’s good for you. The failure of such a premise and the misery it causes have been clear from the dawn of humanity. Kings and congressmen, dictators and Dear Leaders, potentates, princes and presidents can all fall prey to the same imperial impulses: “we know what is good for ‘the people.’
And they are always wrong.
There is a reason that the only times communism has really been tried have been after wars, revolutions, or coups d’état. You have to have complete chaos for people to be willing to accept the garbage that centralized planning produces. Take the Soviet Union, for example. After two wars, famine, and the collapse of the Romanov dynasty, why wouldn’t people wait in line for hours to buy size 10 shoes? Or settle for the gray matter that passed for meat in the grocery stores?
But communism’s watered-down cousin, socialism, isn’t much better. Ask the Venezuelans who cannot get toilet paper. Toilet paper. ¡Viva la Revolución!
Contrary to what so many who believe in a “living Constitution” say, the Founding Fathers absolutely understood this. That is why the Constitution was set up to limit government power. (Memo to the President: the drafters of the Constitution deliberately didn’t say “what government had to do on your behalf.”) They understood that that was the path to folly, fear, and famine.)
3. Obama is deceitful
Just as the collapse of the computer program should not surprise anyone, neither should we be shocked that the President lied about his healthcare plan. Have any of you been paying attention over the past few years? Obama has made no secret of his motivations or his methods. The philosophies which inspire him espouse deceit and other vicious tactics. (Don’t take my word for it: read Saul Alinsky.) Obama infamously told reporter Richard Wolffe, “You know, I actually believe my own bullshit.” He has refused to be forthcoming about his past (where are his academic records?). His own pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, told author Ed Klein, that Obama said to him, “You know what your problem is? You have to tell the truth.”
Did Obama lie when he said dozens of times, “If you like you plan, you can keep it”? Of course he did. That’s what he does.
4. The media is responsible
And had the media been doing their jobs, we would have known a lot of this much, much earlier.
The press is charged with the sacred responsibility of protecting the people from the excesses of government. Our press has been complicit, incompetent, or corrupt. Had they vetted this man in 2008, as they would have a Republican candidate, we would have known far more about him than we do, even now. Had they pressed for more details about Obamacare, Congress’ feet would have been held to the fire. Had they done their jobs about Eric Holder, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the IRS scandal, NSA spying – or any of the other myriad betrayals of the public trust that this administration has committed, Obama would likely have lost his 2012 reelection campaign. (A fact which even the Washington Post has tacitly acknowledged. Well done, fellas! Happy now?)
Instead, they turned a blind eye, even when they knew he was lying, abusing power, disregarding the limits of the Constitution. It was only when he began to spy on them, and when the lies were so blatant that the lowest of low-information voters could figure it out that they realized they had to report on it. (Even in the face of blatant, deliberate and repeated lies, the New York Times has the audacity to tell us that the President “misspoke.”) They have betrayed us, abandoned us, and deceived us.
5. Ted Cruz was right. So was Sarah Palin.
The computer program is a disaster. The insurance exchanges are a disaster. What’s left? The healthcare system itself. And this, of necessity, will be a disaster, too.
Millions of people have lost their individual insurance plans. In 2015, millions more will lose their employer-provided coverage (a fact which the Obama administration also knew, and admitted elsewhere).
The exorbitant additional costs that Obamacare has foisted on unsuspecting Americans are all part of a plan of wealth confiscation and redistribution. That is bad enough. But it will not end there.
When the numbers of people into the system and the corresponding demand for care vastly exceed the cost projections (and they will, make no mistake), then the rationing will start. Not only choice at that point, but quality and care itself will go down the tubes. And then will come the decisions made by the Independent Payment Advisory Board about what care will be covered (read “paid for”) and what will not.
That’s just a death panel, put politely. In fact, progressives are already greasing the wheels for acceptance of that miserable reality as well. They’re spreading the lie that it will be about the ability of the dying to refuse unwanted or unhelpful care. Don’t fall for that one, either. It will be about the deaths that inevitably result from decisions made by people other than the patients, their families, and their physicians. (Perhaps it’s helpful to think of their assurances this way: “If you like your end-of-life care, you can keep your end-of-life-care.”)
6. We are not SUBJECTS (or, Nice Try, the Tea Party Isn’t Going Away) We have tolerated these incursions into our lives and livelihoods too long already. There is no end to the insatiable demand “progressives” have to remake us in their image. Today it is our insurance, our businesses, our doctors, our health care. Tomorrow some new crusade will be announced that enables them to take over other aspects of our formerly free lives.
I will say it again: WE ARE NOT SUBJECTS. Not only is the Tea Party right on the fiscal issues, but it appears that they are more relevant than ever. We fought a war once to prove we did not want to be the subjects of a king, and the Boston Tea Party was just a taste of the larger conflict to come. If some people missed that lesson in history class, we can give them a refresher.
The 2014 elections are a good place to start. Call your representative, your senator, your candidate and tell them: “We are not subjects. You work for us. And if the word “REPEAL” isn’t front and center in your campaign, we won’t vote for you. Period.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillarys-health-care-plan/	Discussion of Canadian Health Care	Mostly Truth!				2015/03/17	"  For those interested in the Hillary and other Social Democrat Health Care plans, here’s something from a Canadian on their social plan. One thing they don’t point out is when the Canadian Medical plan runs out of money (sometimes as early as Sept.) then only the critical can even be seen or cared for. No other illnesses or injuries can be seen until the following year. Government operating the Medical Plan in the US will result in poorer medical care and much higher taxes. The estimated cost for the Hillary plan are already known to be a small fraction of what the “REAL” cost will be (and that is going to be paid by you in taxes and premiums).  


Subject: Health Care 


This was sent from Canada to a friend in the States. 


I saw on the news up here in Canada where Hillary Clinton introduced her new health care plan. Something similar to what we have in Canada. I also heard that Michael Moore was raving about the health care up here in Canada in his latest movie. As your friend and someone who lives with the Canada health care plan I thought I would give you some facts about this great medical plan that we have in Canada. 


First of all: 


1) The health care plan in Canada is not free. We pay a premium every month of $96. for Shirley and I to be covered. Sounds great eh. What they don’t tell you is how much we pay in taxes to keep the health care system afloat. I am personally in the 55% tax bracket. Yes 55% of my earnings go to taxes. A large portion of that and I am not sure of the exact amount goes directly to health care our #1 expense. 


2) I would not classify what we have as health care plan, it is more like a health diagnosis system. You can get into to see a doctor quick enough so he can tell you “yes indeed you are sick or you need an operation” but now the challenge becomes getting treated or operated on. We have waiting lists out the ying yang some as much as 2 years down the road. 


3) Rather than fix what is wrong with you the usual tactic in Canada is to prescribe drugs. Have a pain here is a drug to take- not what is causing the pain and why. No time for checking you out because it is more important to move as many patients thru as possible each hour for Government re-imbursement 


4) Many Canadians do not have a family Doctor.  


5) Don’t require emergency treatment as you may wait for hours in the emergency room waiting for treatment. 


6) Shirley’s dad cut his hand on a power saw a few weeks back and it required that his hand be put in a splint – to our surprise we had to pay $125. for a splint because it is not covered under health care plus we have to pay $60. for each visit for him to check it out each week. 


7) Shirley’s cousin was diagnosed with a heart blockage. Put on a waiting list Died before he could get treatment. 


8) Government allots so many operations per year. When that is done no more operations, unless you go to your local newspaper and plead your case and embarrass the government then money suddenly appears. 


9)The Government takes great pride in telling us how much more they are increasing the funding for health care but waiting lists never get shorter. Government just keeps throwing money at the problem but it never goes away. But they are good at finding new ways to tax us, but they don’t call it a tax anymore it is now a user fee.  


10) A friend needs an operation for a blockage in her leg but because she is a smoker they will not do it. Despite paying into the health care system all these years. My friend is 65 years old. Now there is talk that maybe we should not treat fat and obese people either because they are a drain on the health care system. Let me see now, what we want in Canada is a health care system for healthy people only. That should reduce our health care costs. 


11) Forget getting a second opinion, what you see is what you get. 


12) I can spend what money I have left after taxes on booze, cigarettes, junk food and anything else that could kill me but I am not allowed by law to spend my money on getting an operation I need because that would be jumping the queue. I must wait my turn except if I am a hockey player or athlete then I can get looked at right away. Go figger. Where else in the world can you spend money to kill yourself but not allowed to spend money to get healthy. 


13) Oh did I mention that immigrants are covered automatically at tax payer expense having never contributed a dollar to the system and pay no premiums. 


14) Oh yeh we now give free needles to drug users to try and keep them healthy. Wouldn’t want a sickly druggie breaking into your house and stealing your things. But people with diabetes who pay into the health care system have to pay for their needles because it is not covered but the health care system. 


I send this out not looking for sympathy but as the election looms in the states you will be hearing more and more about universal health care down there and the advocates will be pointing to Canada. I just want to make sure that you hear the truth about health care up here and have some food for thought and informed questions to ask when broached with this subject. 


Step wisely and don’t make the same mistakes we have.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hugh-downs-obama-flake/	"Hugh Downs Calls Obama a ""Flake"""	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
Subject: HUGH DOWNS-OBAMA WILL LOSE
 It’s time to throw my hat in the ring as regards predicting the election results. So here it is: Barack Obama will be defeated. Seriously and convincingly defeated. Not due to racism, not due to the forces of reaction, not even due to Karl Rove sending out mind rays over the national cable system. He will lose for one reason above all, one that has been overlooked in any analysis that I’ve yet seen. Barack Obama will lose because he is a flake.  I’m using the term in its generally accepted sense. A flake is not only a screwup, but someone who truly excels in making bizarre errors and creating incredibly convoluted disasters. A flake is a ‘fool with energy’, as the Russian proverb puts it. (‘A fool is a terrible thing to have around, but a fool with energy is a nightmare’.) 
Barack Obama is a flake, and the American people have begun to see it. The chief characteristic of a flake is that he makes choices that are impossible to either understand or explain. These are not the errors of the poor dope who can’t grasp the essentials of a situation, or the neurotic who ruins things out of compulsion, or the man suffering chronic bad luck. 
The flake has a genius for discovering solutions at perfect right angles to the ordinary world. It’s as if he’s the product of a totally different evolutionary chain, in a universe where the laws are slightly but distinctly at variance to ours. When given a choice between left and right, the flake goes up — if not through the 8th dimension. And although there’s plenty of rationalization, there’s never a logical reason for any of it. After awhile, people stop asking. 
Obama’s rise has been widely portrayed as a kind of millennial Horatio Alger story — young lad from a new state on the outskirts of the American polity, a member of once-despised minority, works his way by slow degrees to within arm’s length of the presidency itself. That’s all well and good — we need national myths of exactly that type. 
But what has been overlooked is the string of faux pas marking each step of Obama’s journey, a series of strange, inexplicable actions, actions bizarre enough to require some effort at explanation, through such efforts have rarely been offered. It’s as if the new Horatio made it to the top by stepping into every last manhole and open trapdoor in his path. And we, the onlookers, the voters who are being asked to put this man in the White House, are supposed to take this as the normal career path for a successful chief executive. 
What are these incidents? I’m sure many of you are way ahead of me, but let’s go to the videotape.  
Here’s a young man who graduated from Columbia with high marks, with a choice of positions anywhere in the country. He comes from a state generally held to be a close match to Paradise. One, furthermore, that can be characterized as the most successful multiracial society in the world, with harmonious relations not only between whites and blacks, but also Japanese-Americans and native Hawaiians as well. To top it off, a state controlled in large part by a smoothly-functioning Democratic machine. So where does he choose to go? 
To Chicago. One of the windiest, coldest, most brutal cities in the country. One that is also infinitely corrupt in a sense that Hawaii is not. One that remains one of the most racist large cities in the U.S. (Cicero, Al Capone’s old stomping grounds, a suburb that is effectiv ely part of the city, is completely segregated to this day.) It would be nice to learn which of these aspects most attracted young Obama to the city. But if you’d asked at the beginning of the campaign, you’d still be waiting. 
And what does he do when he reaches the city? Why, he joins a cult. Jeremiah Wright’s Trinity United Church has been turned inside out since the videotaped sermons appeared early this year, without anyone ever quite explaining exactly what Obama was thinking of when he joined up in the first place. Street cred, so it’s claimed. But there are a plethora of black churches that would have provided him that without the taint of demented racism that Wright’s church offered. 
Obama apparently had to swear an oath of belief in ‘black liberation theology’ when he joined the church. (It is the little touches of that sort that make it a ‘cult’, and not simply a ‘church’.) Did the thought of his caree r ever cross his mind? Didn’t he realize that church would inevitably cause him trouble somewhere down the line? That he’d be required to repudiate it and its ideas eventually? We can ask — but we won’t get an answer. 
Back at school, Obama got himself named editor of the Harvard Law Review. This is a signal achievement, no question about it. The kind of thing that would be mentioned about a person for the rest of his life, as has been the case with Obama. But then… he writes nothing for the journal. 
Now, let’s get this straight: here we have one of the leading university law journals in the country, one widely cited and read. Entire careers in legal analysis and scholarship have been founded on appearances in the Review, including some that have led to the highest courts in the country. Yet here’s an individual who, as editor, could easily place his own work in the journal — standard practice, nothing at all wrong with it. But he fails to do so. And the explanation? There’s none that I’ve heard. We can go even farther than that, to say that there is no explanation that makes the least rational sense. 
We follow Obama down to Springfield, where as a state legislator, he voted ‘present’ over 120 times. What this means, as far as I’ve been able to discover, is that he voted ‘present’ nearly as much as he voted ‘yes’ or ‘no’. 
Now, statehouses work very simply: a member approaches his colleagues and asks them them to vote for his bill. Some comply, some do not. Some ask, ‘Is it a good bill?’ and some don’t. Either way, they customarily, except in unusu al circumstances, vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’. All except for Barack Obama. And how did get away with it? How did mollify his colleagues? How did he square himself with the party bosses? Echo answereth not. 
(A good slogan could be made of this: ‘You can’t vote present in the Oval Office.’ I hereby commend it to the McCain campaign.) 
We turn eagerly to learn what his term in the U.S. Senate will reveal, only to be disappointed. But it’s not surprising, really. After all, he was only there for 143 days.  
And there lies one of the keys to Obama’s rise. David Brooks pointed out in a recent NewYork Times column that Obama spent too little time in any of his positions to make an impact one way or another. This is what saved him from the normal fate of the flake: he was never around long enough for his errors and strange behavior to catch up with him. 
But a presidential campaign is a different matter. A man running for president is under the microscope, and can’t duck anything, as many a candidate has had reason to learn. If Obama is a flake in the classic mode, now is when it would come out. And has it? 
The case cou
ld be made. Here we have a campaign with everything going for it — the opposition party in a shambles, a seriously undervalued president, the media in the candidate’s pocket, the candidate himself being worshiped as nothing less than the new messiah. And yet the results have compr ised little more than one fumble after another. 
First came the Wright affair. Obama apparently thought he was above it all — a not-uncommon phenomenon with flakes — and allowed the revelations to take on a life of their own before bothering to respond. Even then, his thoughtful and convincing explanation (that he hadn’t been listening for twenty years) did little to settle the crisis, which instead guttered out on its own after nearly crippling his campaign. Even months afterward it threatens to pop back up at any time. The latest word is that Wright — now a deadly enemy of his onetime protege — has written a book. I can’t wait. 
Obama learned his lesson, and confronted the next threat immediately, tackling The New Yorker cover with the avidity of a man having discovered zombies in the basement. A development that could have been defused with a chuckle and a quip (the customary method is for the politician to ask the cartoonist for the original) was allowed to explode into a major issue. The campaign’s relentless attacks on one of the oldest liberal magazines extant merely perplexed the country at large. After all, any Republican has had to endure far worse. 
Almost simultaneously, the birth certificate saga was unfolding. On no reasonable grounds, the campaign blew off requests for a copy of the document, at last releasing it through one of the least reputable sites on the Internet, and so badly copied that literally anything could be read into it — and was. I’m not one of those who believes that Obama was actually born in Indonesia/Kenya/Moscow/the moon, but I still have plenty in the way of questions, almost all of them arising from how the matter was handled. Well played. 
The latest pothole (or one of them, anyway) involves Jerome Corsi’s=The Obama Nation. Corsi has been given the full New Yorker treatment, with the campaign hoping to avoid John Kerry’s ‘error’ in not challenging Corsi’s 2004 book, Unfit for Command. What Obama missed was the fact that Kerry’s major problem was not with Corsi but with the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, who were disgusted with Kerry’s hypocrisy in running as an experienced military veteran, and set out to take him down. Corsi’s effort dovetailed with the veteran’s campaign and to a large extent was swept up with it. No such campaign is in operation against Obama. The smart method of answering Corsi would have been to allow the media to handle it, instead of drawing attention to the book and raising it to level of an issue. This appears to be a real talent for the Obama campaign. 
We could go on. The victory tour of Europe, and the speech in which Obama declared himself ‘citizen of the world’, a trope guaranteed to focus the attention of Middle America. His inept handling of Hillary, in which he wound up appearing frightened of the opponent he’d just beaten. Allowing Hillary (and her husband there, what’s-his-name) a starring role in the Democratic convention is not a solution any sane individual would be comfortable with — much less a roll-call vote. This threatens the near-certainty of turning the entire affair into BillandHillarycon, with the nominee winding up as a footnote. But it’s all of a piece with the campaign Obama has waged up until now. 
We’ve never had a flake as president. We’ve had drunks, neurotics, cripples, louts, and fools, but never a career screwup. (I except Jimmy Carter, whose errors arose from sincere, misguided goodwill.) And I don’t think we’re going to get one now. Another three months of flailing, incompetence, and a collapsing image will do little to assure voters concerned with terrorism, the oil crunch, a gyrating economy, and a bellicose Russia. (Anyone doubting that Obama will go exactly this route can consider the Saddleback church fiasco, which unfolded as this piece was being wrapped up. Evidently, the campaign goaded NBC news personality Andrea Mitchell into all but accusing John McCain of ‘cheating’ by failing to take his place within the ‘cone of silence’ during Obama’s part of the program. The grotesque element here is that Obama’s people and much of the liberal commentariat — including Mitchell — apparently believe that the ‘cone of silence’, a gag prop for the old Get Smart! comedy series, actually exists and was in use at Saddleback.) 
Many of us have dealt with flakes at one time or another, often in settings involving jobs and careers, and not uncommonly in positions of some authority. We all know of the nephew, the fiance, the boyfriend, whose whims must be catered to, whose reputation must be protected, who must be constantly worked around if anything at all is to be accomplished, always at the cost of time, money, efficiency, and personal stress. 
In the fullness of time, we will inevitably see such a figure in the White House. But not this year, and not this candidate. Such acts of national flakery occur only when theres no real alternative. In this election, an alternative exists. Whatever his shortcomings, nobody ever called John McCain a flake.

Dianne Feinstein: “All vets are mentally ill and government should prevent them from owning firearms”
Kurt Nimmo: “Senator Feinstein insults all U.S. Veterans as she flays about in a vain attempt to save her bill.”
Quote of the Day from the Los Angeles Times:
“Frankly, I don’t know what it is about California, but we seem to have a strange urge to elect really obnoxious women to high office.  I’m not bragging, you understand, but no other state, including Maine, even comes close. When it comes to sending left-wing dingbats to Washington, we’re Number One. There’s no getting around the fact that the last time anyone saw the likes of Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Maxine Waters, and Nancy Pelosi, they were stirring a cauldron when the curtain went up on ‘Macbeth’. The four of them are like jackasses who happen to possess the gift of blab. You don’t know if you should condemn them for their stupidity or simply marvel at their ability to form words.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/greyhound1/	President’s Campaign Bus Was Made In Canada at a Cost of $1,100,000	Truth! & Fiction!				2015/03/17	"
The $1.1 million vehicle, one of two that Quebec-based Prevost sold the government, has been tricked out by the Secret Service with state-of-the-art security features and creature comforts.
It’s a VIP H3-45 model, the company’s top of the line, and is used by major traveling rock bands.
“That’s the more luxurious model,” Christine Garant of Prevost told The Post.
COOL RIDE, EH! It’s the only way to travel for President Obama, who is pushing American jobs — in a Canadian-made bus.
OBAMA’S $2.2 MILLION BUSES
“When we have the Country Music Awards, we sometimes see a lot of them,” she said, noting that Kid Rock, David Lee Roth and Kenny Rogers also have owned them.
Obama’s new ride is equipped to carry all the baggage a president needs — including the “football” that allows him to remotely control US nuclear weapons.
There’s electronic equipment allowing Obama to communicate and teleconference worldwide.
Like his GM-built limousine, nicknamed “The Beast,” the bus has armored doors.
The president also has large flat-screen TV sets and comfortable couches.
There’s a bathroom, but unlike on Air Force One, no sleeping area.
The bus was ordered by the Secret Service in July 2010 and delivered two months ago.
The feds bought the two coaches for $2.2 million from Hemphill Brothers Coach, based in Tennessee. It installed custom interior upgrades into the Prevost shell, which accounted for about half the cost.
The contract lists the country of origin as Canada and place of manufacture as “outside U.S. – Trade Agreements,” a possible reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Hemphill wouldn’t comment on the bus. But an ad on its Web site for a similar bus costing $100,000 less than what has been dubbed “Greyhound One” boasts: “This coach is appointed with the finest materials and the latest in high tech electronics and was built for a top entertainer to travel efficiently without losing the luxuries of home.
“It is the perfect coach for entertainers, sports stars, NASCAR drivers, executive travel, or anyone accustomed to the very best.”
Ed Donovan, a Secret Service spokesman, said, “There are certain security and communications equipment that we’ll have in there. It’s just a better situation for us rather than leasing something and then putting in temporary equipment.”
Hemphill Brothers lists Beyoncé, Cher, KISS, Van Halen, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga, and Pope Benedict XVI as clients on its Web site.
The Secret Service says the buses will be available to other protectees who travel by bus, which could include the 2012 GOP presidential nominee
Other Rumors:
Secret Service Buys Two New $1.1 Million Buses For Three-Day Trip…
US President Barack Obama (C) walks to his bus as he arrives in Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, Minnesota, August 15, 2011, where he is to begin his three-day bus tour in the Midwest centering on ways to grow the economy. (AFP PHOTO/Jim WATSON)
He FLYS into an airport somewhere in the midwest, hops into a brand new 1.1 Million $ bus, paid for by you and me, for a “bus tour” ‘around the Midwest’, and after an hour or so, gets driven back to the airport for ANOTHER FLIGHT, lands at another airport where another 1.1 Million $ brand new black bus is waiting for him… and repeats all that until his midwest bus‘tour’ is done?? Oh yes……and THEN he leaves on a 12 day vacation to Martha’s Vineyard…….to REST UP from this campaign bus tour!
And don’t forget……..those brand new shiny black buses aren’t DRIVEN to the location where they meet Obama. Those buses are loaded up on one or more C-17s. Then, they are flown to the destination ahead of AirForce-1.
AND!…….this is REPEATED FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN STOP.
On this ‘bus tour’, the Prez will lecture the ‘little people’ on how they need to live within their means and cut-back! Remember when very recently Obama told that family man to GO BUY A HYBRID VAN when he said he couldn’t afford to fill up his truck????
Obama’s ‘carbon footprint’ must be as large as most cities by now.
All of this on the taxpayer’s dime…..But remember, this is NOT a campaign trip – it is “Meet with the people” trip only! So that the DNC does NOT pay a cent for all of this.
PS: He ordered these busses from a Canadian company

This photo shows Chavez with his arm around Linda Panetta, while former Sandinista junta leader Daniel Ortega smiles on, at left. You saw it here first.
If the adult daughter of a CIA Director-designate hangs out with sworn enemies of the United States, it’s a matter for the United States Senate to probe aggressively. And so the Senate really has to ask some very pointed questions about Linda Panetta, daughter of President-Elect Obama’s pick to lead the CIA, and her ties to Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega and Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.
 Linda Panetta is a noted anti-military activist who has accused the US military of teaching Latin American officers how to torture. She has also been close to causes hostile toward the United States and friendly to the old Soviet Union, and the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Iran.

*Date: Sunday, 10-May-2009 20:38:18*
This should be put on the front page of every newspaper. This  administration is on the verge of ruining our Country, 3 ¾ years how much  can he spend in that time?
April 17, 2009
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington , DC 20500
Mr. Obama:
I have had it with you and your administration, sir. Your conduct on your  recent trip overseas has convinced me that you are not an adequate  representative of the United States of America collectively or of me  personally.  You are so obsessed with appeasing the Europeans and the Muslim world that  you have abdicated the responsibilities of the President of the United  States of America . You are responsible to the citizens of the United States.  You are not responsible to the peoples of any other country on earth.
I personally resent that you go around the world apologizing for the United  States telling Europeans that we are arrogant and do not care about their  status in the world. Sir, what do you think the First World War and the Second  World War were all about if not the consideration of the peoples of Europe?   Are you brain dead? What do you think the Marshall Plan was all about? Do you not understand or know the history of the 20th century?
Where do you get off telling a Muslim country that the United States does not consider itself a Christian country? Have you not read the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the United States ? This country was founded on Judeo-Christian ethics and the principles governing this country, at least until you came along, come directly from this heritage. Do you not understand this?
Your bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia is an affront to all Americans. Our President does not bow down to anyone, let alone the king of Saudi Arabia . You don’t show Great Britain , our best and one of our oldest allies, the respect they deserve yet you bow down to the king of Saudi Arabia . How dare you, sir! How dare you! You can’t find the time to visit the graves of our greatest generation because you don’t want to offend the Germans but make time  to visit a mosque in Turkey . You offended our dead and every veteran when you give the  Germans more respect than the people who saved the German people from  themselves. What’s the matter with you?
I am convinced that you and the members of your administration have the historical and intellectual depth of a mud puddle and should be ashamed of yourselves, all of you.
You are so self-righteously offended by the big bankers and the American automobile manufacturers yet do nothing about the real thieves in this situation, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Frank, Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelic, the Fannie Mae bonuses, and the Freddie Mac bonuses. What do you intend to do about them? Anything? I seriously doubt it.
What about the U.S. House members passing out $9.1 million in bonuses to their staff members – on top of the $2.5 million in automatic pay raises that lawmakers gave themselves? I understand the average House aide got a
17% bonus. I took a 5% cut in my pay to save jobs with my employer. You haven’t said anything about that. Who authorized that? I surely didn’t!
Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be receiving $210 million in bonuses over an eighteen-month period, that’s $45 million more than the AIG bonuses. In fact, Fannie and Freddie executives have already been awarded $51 million – not a bad take. Who authorized that and why haven’t you expressed your outrage at this group who are largely responsible for the economic mess we have right now.
I resent that you take me and my fellow citizens as brain-dead and not caring about what you idiots do.
We are watching what you are doing and we are getting increasingly fed up with all of you.
I also want you to know that I personally find just about everything you do and say to be offensive to every one of my sensibilities.
I promise you that I will work tirelessly to see that you do not get a chance to spend two terms destroying my beautiful country.
Sincerely,
Every real American

https://www.truthorfiction.com/kit-lange/	Air Force Veteran Wrote Predictions For The Obama Presidency	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
“Kit Lange is an Air Force veteran and military writer who specializes in investigating murder cases stemming from actions in combat. Her work was used as evidence in the Lt. Ilario Pantano case, and has been quoted extensively in other news publications for other cases. In 2005, she co-wrote a 10-part series disproving war crime allegations against an elite Army unit; her blog, EuphoricReality.com, was named as one of the top 10 milblogs of the year. She is also the National Web Coordinator for Gathering of Eagles, a nationally-recognized troop support organization. Kit holds a degree in Aircraft Maintenance Technology from Spartan College of Aeronautics, and is currently working on a second degree in Aviation Technology Management. She resides in Tulsa, Oklahoma . 




INTERESTING COMMENTARY FROM A FEMALE AIR FORCE VETERAN WHO IS NOW A TALK SHOW HOST. 
Kit Lange is a lady (Former Air Force) who has worked tirelessly on the Hutchins case. 
My Predictions for the New Obama “Presidency”. 
Now that America has shown us all that affirmative action even works in politics, I’ve compiled a list of things that you can probably expect to happen. These predictions are 80% gleaned from information all of us have access to, and 15% gut instinct based on many years of research, historical study, and being glued to current affairs. The other 5% is just anger at my countrymen’s stupidity–I admit it. 
– Websites and mass emails offering “free grants,” courtesy of the government and “Obama’s wealth redistribution.” Actually, this one’s a freebie, because I have an email with a date and timestamp of literally minutes after Obama was declared the winner, offering exactly that. 
– Israel will understand this election was the end of any type of assistance, military or otherwise, from the U.S. , and will stop holding back their defense at the request of the American administration. Look for a first strike on Iran soon, as well as increased activity by the Israeli military in general. Israel is on her own now, and God help us all because of it. 
– Look for Iranian retaliation–against American targets. That goes doubly for other terrorist organizations. We just elected a man with the full endorsement of every major terrorist group in the world as leader of the free world. It’s the political equivalent of hiring a child molester to babysit your kids while you leave for the weekend. Not only is HE going to have fun with your child, but he’ll probably sit and watch while his friends come over and do it too. 
– Look for far-left justices appointed to the Supreme Court, effectively tying up the entire government in a trifecta of liberal humanism, the buzzwords of which remain empty platitudes like “hope and change,” and the ultimate goal of which is socialism–and soon, sharia law. 
– Military cases of troops being tried and convicted for killing the enemy in combat will continue to rise–and the conviction/plea-bargain rate will stay at nearly 100%, as the government seeks to use the best men and women this country has to offer as sacrificial lambs on the altar of global appeasement. Those brave and honorable men who currently reside in prison cells across the country, stripped of their rank, their careers, families, and their good name, will not taste free air again for many years. Their sacrifices and their stories will be forgotten by the general public, remembered only by those of us who continue to fight for them. 
– Look for the slow but steady erosion of rights you have enjoyed for your entire lives–all the while being told it’s “for your own good.” Restrictions on gun ownership, home schooling, encouraged dependence on the ever-growing federal government. More nanny-state provisions will be put into place to protect the “disadvantaged” and the “poor,” (read: lazy, uneducated, unwilling to better themselves) even while groups like the unborn, the mentally handicapped, elderly, and terminally ill are slowly pushed toward euthanasia. Of course, this will be done with feel-good phrases like “death with dignity,” “not wanting to be a burden,” and “merciful release from suffering,” all of which ignore the basic fact that we are killing people without their consent for the “good of the people.” Before you tell me I’m crazy, let’s just remember that Barack Obama was the ONLY senator in the Illinois state senate to vote against providing medical care for babies who were inconsiderate enough to survive an abortion. Also, look for taxes to go up. Yes, they’ll go up. 
– You think the economy is bad now? Just wait. You’ll have the most expensive “free” health care ever. Bread lines aren’t just for Russians anymore. <BR< BR>We have traded experience for color, freedom for slavery–and the irony is that the average American sheeple thinks their vote somehow righted an ancient wrong, somehow ENDED the spectre of slavery and ushered in some beautiful era of liberty. In reality, we are about to be less free than you ever thought possible. 
I watched the faces of those crowded into the mob (excuse the pun) in Chicago . They stared at Obama like he was a god, an idol, a panacea to their every want and need. We have truly failed as a nation if we are at the point where we feel we must look to one man to take care of us all, to be our father figure and our sugar daddy. We have lost not only the “can-do” attitude of past generations, but the “MUST-do” attitude of our forefathers. We have allowed ourselves to become reduced from Patrick Henry’s proud cry of “liberty or death” to the sniveling, whining idea that we are owed something. We have gone from being the honorable defenders of freedom to being told we are the problem. 
The eyes of Obama and McCain were also telling. McCain acted with class and grace in his concession speech, offering the most honorable response I’ve seen yet. I don’t agree with all of McCain’s positions, but it cannot be denied that the man has served his nation–at permanent and severe detriment to himself–for half a century. His eyes were clear and sincere, honest. His speech underlined the very reasons why, of the two men offered, he was hands down the better choice. 
On the other hand, Obama’s eyes were cold, calculating. His manner was smug and still carried the arrogance he has always had. His facial expression was one of barely disguised disdain for everything people like me believe in. His body language was smooth, polished–too much so. He talked of patriotism as though it is a value he is familiar with–and yet, his horrifying attitude toward the country he now leads is as well-documented as his friendships with those who seek its demise. He is charismatic to those who don’t know what to look for, and he is inspiring to those who cannot or will not think for themselves. However, too many who voted for him are guilty of the most dangerous kind of hypocrisy. You see, we are told daily that we must not see color, just mankind. (We are all family, you know–or so we’re told.) And yet Barack Obama was handed the White House on a silver platter by a fawning media, a bevy of foreign donors (who, to this day and in violation of U.S. election laws, remain nameless and unaccounted for), and a populace
who voted based on color instead of right and wrong–even in the face of the most damning evidence against a Presidential candidate in many years, perhaps ever. 
It is said that the people receive the government they deserve. Sadly, I fear that’s correct. We have become complacent, unwilling to see the writing on the wall, content to frolic in the warm water without bearing to notice that it’s been getting hotter by the minute. We are two seconds from a rolling boil–and perhaps it is already too late. 
So, liberals, enjoy your victory. Jump around. Have a party, file for your free grants. Scream “Gimme my handout!” and make fun of those of us who fought to make sure your “messiah” didn’t get access to the most powerful position in the world. Just remember when it all comes crashing down: You own the White House, the Congress, and soon the Supreme Court. You have no one to blame but yourselves for the mess you just created. 
As for me, I’m buying my handguns this week so I have an answer for those who will come try to take them.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/charles-krauthammer/	Dr. Charles Krauthammer comments about President Obama	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Dr. Charles Krauthammer
Recently Dr. Charles Krauthammer spoke to the Center for the American Experiment.
He is brilliant, intellectual, seasoned & articulate.
He is forthright and careful in his analysis, and never resorts to emotions or personal insults.
He is NOT a fear monger nor an extremist in his comments and views.
He is a fiscal conservative, and has received a Pulitzer Prize for writing.
He is a frequent contributor to Fox News and writes weekly for the Washington Post.
Here is a summarization of his comments, as we are living in uncharted waters economically and internationally.
If you feel like forwarding this to those who are open minded and have not drunk the Kool-Aid, feel free.
Summary of his comments:
1. Mr. Obama is a very intellectual, charming individual. He is not to be underestimated. He is a cool customer who doesn’t show his emotions. It’s very hard to know what’s behind the mask. The taking down of the Clinton dynasty by a political neophyte was an amazing accomplishment. The Clintons still do not understand what hit them. Obama was in the perfect place at the perfect time.
2. Obama has political skills comparable to Reagan and Clinton. He has a way of making you think he’s on your side, agreeing with your position, while doing the opposite. Pay no attention to what he SAYS; rather, watch what he DOES!
3. Obama has a ruthless quest for power. He did not come to Washington to make something out of himself, but rather to change everything, including dismantling capitalism. He can’t be straightforward on his ambitions, as the public would not go along. He has a heavy hand, and wants to level the playing field with income redistribution and punishment to the achievers of society. He would like to model the USA to Great Britain or Canada .
4. His three main goals are to control ENERGY, PUBLIC EDUCATION, and NATIONAL HEALTHCARE by the Federal government. He doesn’t care about the auto or financial services industries, but got them as an early bonus. The cap and trade will add costs to everything and stifle growth. Paying for FREE college education is his goal. Most scary is his healthcare program, because if you make it FREE and add 46,000,000 people to a Medicare-type single-payer system, the costs will go through the roof. The only way to control costs is with massive RATIONING of services, like in Canada. God forbid!
5. He has surrounded himself with mostly far-left academic types. No one around him has ever even run a candy store. But they are going to try and run the auto, financial, banking and other industries. This obviously can’t work in the long run. Obama is not a socialist; rather he’s a far-left secular progressive bent on nothing short of revolution. He ran as a moderate, but will govern from the hard left. Again, watch what he does, not what he says.
6. Obama doesn’t really see himself as President of the United States, but more as a ruler over the world. He sees himself above it all, trying to orchestrate & coordinate various countries and their agendas. He sees moral equivalency in all cultures. His apology tour in Germany and England was a prime example of how he sees America, as an imperialist nation that has been arrogant, rather than a great noble nation that has at times made errors. This is the first President ever who has chastised our allies and appeased our enemies!
7. He is now handing out goodies. He hopes that the bill (and pain) will not come due until after he is reelected in 2012. He would like to blame all problems on Bush from the past, and hopefully his successor in the future. He has a huge ego, and Dr. Krauthammer believes he is a narcissist.
8. Republicans are in the wilderness for a while, but will emerge strong. Republicans are pining for another Reagan, but there will never be another like him. Krauthammer believes Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty & Bobby Jindahl (except for his terrible speech in February) are the future of the party. Newt Gingrich is brilliant, but has baggage. Sarah Palin is sincere and intelligent, but needs to really be seriously boning up on facts and info if she is to be a serious candidate in the future. We need to return to the party of lower taxes, smaller government, personal responsibility, strong national defense, and state’s rights.
9. The current level of spending is irresponsible and outrageous. We are spending trillions that we don’t have. This could lead to hyperinflation, depression or worse. No country has ever spent themselves into prosperity. The media is giving Obama, Reid and Pelosi a pass because they love their agenda. But eventually the bill will come due and people will realize the huge bailouts didn’t work, nor will the stimulus package. These were trillion-dollar payoffs to Obama’s allies, unions and the Congress to placate the left, so he can get support for #4 above.
10. The election was over in mid-September when Lehman brothers failed, fear and panic swept in, we had an unpopular President, and the war was grinding on indefinitely without a clear outcome. The people are in pain, and the mantra of change caused people to act emotionally. Any Dem would have won this election; it was surprising it was as close as it was.
11. In 2012, if the unemployment rate is over 10%, Republicans will be swept back into power. If it’s under 8%, the Dems continue to roll. If it’s between 8-10%, it will be a dogfight. It will all be about the economy. I hope this gets you really thinking about what’s happening in Washington and Congress. There is a left-wing revolution going on, according to Krauthammer, and he encourages us to keep the faith and join the loyal resistance. The work will be hard, but we’re right on most issues and can reclaim our country, before it’s far too late.
Our futures and children’s futures depend on our good understanding of what is really going on in DC,
and our action pursuant to that understanding!!
It really IS up to each of us to take individual action!!
Start with educating your friends and neighbors!!!

“A moment I’ve been dreading. George brought his n’er-do-well son around this morning and asked me to find the kid a job. Not the political one who lives in Florida ; the one who hangs around here all the time looking shiftless. This so-called kid is already almost 40 and has never had a real job. Maybe I’ll call Kinsley over at The New Republic and see if they’ll hire him as a contributing editor or something. That looks like easy work.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ted-kennedy-legacy/	"An Email about called ""The Last of the Kennedy Dynasty"""	 Truth! Fiction!& Unproven!				2015/03/17	" The Last of The Kennedy Dynasty
 As soon as his cancer was detected, I noticed the immediate attempt at the “canonization” of old Teddy Kennedy by the mainstream media. They are saying what a “great American” he is. I say, let’s get a couple things clear & not twist the facts to change the real history.
 1. He was caught cheating at Harvard when he attended it. He was expelled twice, once for cheating on a test, and once for paying a classmate to cheat for him.
 2. While expelled, Kennedy enlisted in the Army, but mistakenly signed up for four years instead of two. Oops! The man can’t count to four! His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to England (a step up from bootlegging liquor into the US from Canada during prohibition), pulled the necessary strings to have his enlistment shortened to two years, and to ensure that he served in Europe, not Korea , where a war was raging. No preferential treatment for him! (like he charged that President Bush received).
 3. Kennedy was assigned to Paris , never advanced beyond the rank of Private, and returned to Harvard upon being discharged. Imagine a person of his “education” NEVER advancing past the rank of Private!
 4. While attending law school at the University of Virginia , he was cited for reckless driving four times, including once when he was clocked driving 90 miles per hour in a residential neighborhood with his headlights off after dark. Yet his Virginia driver’s license was never revoked. Coincidentally, he passed the bar exam in 1959. Amazing!
 5. In 1964, he was seriously injured in a plane crash, and hospitalized for several months.. Test results done by the hospital at the time he was admitted had shown he was legally intoxicated. The results of those tests remained a “state secret” until in the 1980’s when the report was unsealed. Didn’t hear about that from the unbiased media, did we?
 6. On July 19, 1969, Kennedy attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts . At about 11:00 PM, he borrowed his chauffeur’s keys to his Oldsmobile limousine, and offered to give a ride home to Mary Jo Kopechne, a campaign worker. Leaving the island via an unlit bridge with no guard rail, Kennedy steered the car off the bridge, flipped, and into Poucha Pond.
 7. He swam to shore and walked back to the party, passing several houses and a fire station. Two friends then returned with him to the scene of the accident. According to their later testimony, they told him what he already knew – that he was required by law to immediately report the accident to the authorities. Instead Kennedy made his way to his hotel, called his lawyer, and went to sleep. Kennedy called the police the next morning and by then the wreck had already been discovered. Before dying, Kopechne had scratched at the upholstered floor above her head in the upside-down car. 
 The Kennedy family began “calling in favors”, ensuring that any inquiry would be contained. Her corpse was whisked out-of-state to her family, before an autopsy could be conducted. Further details are uncertain, but after the accident Kennedy says he repeatedly dove under the water trying to rescue Kopechne and he didn’t call police because he was in a state of shock. It is widely assumed Kennedy was drunk, and he held off calling police in hopes that his family could fix the problem overnight. Since the accident, Kennedy’s “political enemies” have referred to him as the distinguished Senator from Chappaquiddick. He pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident, and was given a SUSPENDED SENTENCE OF TWO MONTHS. Kopechne’s family received a small payout from the Kennedy’s insurance policy, and never sued. There was later an effort to have her body exhumed and autopsied, but her family successfully fought against this in court, and Kennedy’s family paid their attorney’s bills… a “token of friendship”?
 8. Kennedy has held his Senate seat for more than forty years, but considering his longevity, his accomplishments seem scant. He authored or argued for legislation that ensured a variety of civil rights, increased the minimum wage in 1981, made access to health care easier for the indigent, and funded Meals on Wheels for fixed-income seniors and is widely held as the “standard-bearer for liberalism”. In his very first Senate roll, he was the floor manager for the bill that turned U.S. immigration policy upside down and opened the floodgate for immigrants from third world countries.
 9. Since that time, he has been the prime instigator and author of every expansion of an increase in immigration, up to and including the latest attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Not to mention the pious grilling he gave the last two Supreme Court nominees, as if he was the standard bearer for the nation in matters of “what’s right”. What a pompous ass!
 10. He is known around Washington as a public drunk, loud, boisterous and very disrespectful to ladies. JERK is a better description than “great American”. “A blonde in every pond” is his motto.
 Let’s not allow the spin doctors make this jerk a hero — how quickly the American public forgets what his real legacy is. Let’s keep this going for truth, justice and the American way!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/lee-iacocca/	Lee Iacocca regarding leadership in America	Truth!				2015/03/17	"  I wonder how many of us really pay attention to the Congressional races. We should vote for visionaries who can implement a plan and folks who can work together. That is the problem with Congress; too many people posturing for the next election on Both sides of the aisle. I think Thomas Jefferson and Friends would not recognize our country today.  
Alot of truth in these words and both sides of the isle are at fault. 
———- 
Try to find something in this you disagree with. This needs to be said. Rep. or Dem. doesn’t even come into play in this statement. _____________________________________________________ 
Remember Lee Iacocca, the man who rescued Chrysler Corporation from it’s death throes? He has a new book, and here are some excerpts. _____________________________________________________________ 
Lee Iacocca Says: 
‘Am I the only guy in this country who’s fed up with what’s happening? Where the hell is our outrage? We should be screaming bloody murder. We’ve got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff, we’ve got corporate gangsters stealing us blind, and we can’t even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car. But instead of getting mad, everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say, ‘Stay the course’ 
Stay the course? You’ve got to be kidding. This is America , not the damned ‘Titanic’. I’ll give you a sound bite: ‘Throw all the bums out!’  
You might think I’m getting senile, that I’ve gone off my rocker, and maybe I have. But someone has to speak up. I hardly recognize this country anymore. 
The most famous business leaders are not the innovators but the guys in handcuffs. While we’re fiddling in Iraq , the Middle East is burning and nobody seems to know what to do. And the press is waving ‘pom-poms’ instead of asking hard questions. That’s not the promise of the ‘ America ‘ my parents and yours traveled across the ocean for. I’ve had enough. How about you? 
I’ll go a step further. You can’t call yourself a patriot if you’re not outraged. This is a fight I’m ready and willing to have. The Biggest ‘C’ is Crisis! Leaders are made, not born. Leadership is forged in times of crisis. It’s easy to sit there with your feet up on the desk and talk theory. Or send someone else’s kids off to war when you’ve never seen a battlefield yourself. It’s another thing to lead when your world comes tumbling down. 
On September 11, 2001, we needed a strong leader more than any other time in our history. We needed a steady hand to guide us out of the ashes.  
A Hell of a Mess. So here’s where we stand. We’re immersed in a bloody war with no plan for winning and no plan for leaving. We’re running the biggest deficit in the history of the country. We’re losing the manufacturing edge to Asia , while our once-great companies are getting slaughtered by health care costs. Gas prices are skyrocketing, and nobody in power has a coherent energy policy. Our schools are in trouble. Our borders are like sieves. 
The middle class is being squeezed every which way. These are times that cry out for leadership. But when you look around, you’ve got to ask: ‘Where have all the leaders gone?’ Where are the curious, creative communicators? Where are the people of character, courage, conviction, omnipotence, and common sense? I may be a sucker for alliteration, but I think you get the point. 
Name me a leader who has a better idea for homeland security than making us take off our shoes in airports and throw away our shampoo? We’ve spent billions of dollars building a huge new bureaucracy, and all we know how to do is react to things that have already happened. 
Name me one leader who emerged from the crisis of Hurricane Katrina. Congress has yet to spend a single day evaluating the response to the hurricane, or demanding accountability for the decisions that were made in the crucial hours after the storm. 
Everyone’s hunkering down, fingers crossed, hoping it doesn’t happen again. Now, that’s just crazy. Storms happen. Deal with it. Make a plan. Figure out what you’re going to do the next time. 
Name me an industry leader who is thinking creatively about how we can restore our competitive edge in manufacturing. Who would have believed that there could ever be a time when ‘The Big Three’ referred to Japanese car companies? How did this happen, and more important, what are we going to do about it? 
Name me a government leader who can articulate a plan for paying down the debt, or solving the energy crisis, or managing the health care problem. The silence is deafening. But these are the crises that are eating away at our country and milking the middle class dry. 
I have news for the gang in Congress. We didn’t elect you to sit on your asses and do nothing and remain silent while our democracy is being hijacked and our greatness is being replaced with mediocrity. What is everybody so afraid of? That some bonehead on Fox News will call them a name? Give me a break. Why don’t you guys show some spine for a change? 
Had Enough? 
Hey, I’m not trying to be the voice of gloom and doom here. I’m trying to light a fire. I’m speaking out because I have hope, I believe in America . In my lifetime I’ve had the privilege of living through some of America ‘s greatest moments. I’ve also experienced some of our worst crises: the ‘Great Depression’, ‘World War II’, the ‘Korean War’, the ‘Kennedy Assassination’, the ‘Vietnam War’, the 1970s oil crisis, and the struggles of recent years culminating with 9/11. If I’ve learned one thing, it’s this: ‘You don’t get anywhere by standing on the sidelines waiting for somebody else to take action. Whether it’s building a better car or building a better future for our children, we all have a role to play. That’s the challenge I’m raising in this book. It’s a call to ‘Action’ for people who, like me, believe in America . It’s not too late, but it’s getting pretty close. So let’s shake off the crap and go to work. Let’s tell ’em all we’ve had ‘enough.’

https://www.truthorfiction.com/michelle-obama-trip/	Michelle Obama cuts trip short because her husband is a Muslim and Shariarestrictions	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
Michelle Obama trip…….Interesting Information!     
I was at Blockbusters on Saturday renting videos, and I was going along the wall and there was a video called “Obama”. We started talking about Obama.
 These guys were Arabs, and I asked them why they thought Michelle Obama headed home following her visit in France instead of traveling on to Saudi Arabia and Turkey with her husband.
 They said she couldn’t go to Saudi Arabia, Turkey or Iraq.
 I said, “Laura Bush went to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Dubai.”
 They answered, “Obama is a Muslim, and by Muslim law, he would not be allowed to bring his wife into the countries that accept Sharia Law.”
 Just thought it was interesting that the Arabs at Blockbuster’s accept the idea that we’re being led by a Muslim who follows the Islamic creed. They also said that’s the reason he bowed to the King of Saudi Arabia. It was a signal to the Muslim world.
 Just thought you would like to know.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/military-deaths/	There Were More Military Deaths During The Clinton Presidency Than During the George W. Bush Presidency	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"
Whatever your politics, however you lean, however you feel about the War on Terrorism, this report should open some eyes.
________________________________________________________
Military Losses, 1980 through 2006
 
These are some rather eye-opening facts. Since the start of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, the sacrifice has been enormous. In the time period from the invasion of Iraq< B> in March 2003 through today, we have lost over 3,000 military personnel to enemy action and accidents. As tragic as the loss of any member of the US Armed Forces is, consider the following statistics:
The annual fatalities of military members while actively serving in the armed forces from 1980 through 2006:< /STRONG>
1980 ……….. 2,392 (Carter Year)
1981 ………. 2,380 (Reagan Year)
1984 ……….. 1,999 (Reagan Year)
1988 ………. 1,819 (Reagan Year)
1989 ……….. 1,636 (Bush, George HW Year)
1990 ………. 1,508 (Bush, George HW Year)
1991 ……… 1,787 (Bush, George HW Year)
1992 ……….. 1,293 (Bush, George HW Year)
1993 ………. 1,213 (Clinton Year)
1994 ……… 1,075 (Clinton Year)
1995 ……… 2,465 (Clinton Year)
1996 ……… 2,318 (Clinton Year) Clinton years (1993-2000): 14,000 deaths
1997 ………… 817 (Clinton Year)
1998 ……… 2,252 (Clinton Year)
1999 ……… 1,984 (Clinton Year)
2000 ……… 1,983 (Clinton Year)
2001 ……….. 890 (Bush, George W Year)
2002 ………. 1,007 (Bush, George W Year)
2003 ………. 1,410 (Bush, George W Year)
2004 ………. 1,887 (Bush, George W Year) Bush, George W years (2001-2006): 7,033 deaths
2005 …………. 919 (Bush, George W Year)
2006………….. 920 (Bush, George W Year)
If you are confused when you look at these figures, so was I. Do these figures mean that the loss from the two latest conflicts in the Middle East are LESS than the loss of military personnel during Mr. Clinton’s presidency; when America w asn’t even involved in a war?
And, I was even more confused; when I read that in 1980, during the reign of President (Nobel Peace Prize winner) Jimmy Carter, there were 2,39 2 US military fatalities! — almost 1/3 MORE than the worst year, 2004, of the Iraq / Afghan War under G.W. Bush!)
These figures indicate that many members of our Media and our Politicians will pick and choose. They present only those ‘facts’ which support their agenda-driven reporting. Why do so many of them march in lock-step to twist the trut h? Where do so many of them get their marching-orders for their agenda?
The latest census of Americans shows the following distribution of American citizens, by Race:
European descent .. ……………………. 69.12%
Hispanic …………………………………. 12.5%
Black ……………………………………… 12.3%
Asian . 3.7%
Native American . 1.0%
Other ………………………………………… 2.6%
Now… Here are the fatalities by Race; over the past three years in Iraqi Freedom:
European descent …….. ……..74.31%
Hispanic ……………. ……………….. 10.74%
Black …………………………………….. 9.67%
Asian . 1.81%
Native American . 1.09%
Other ……………………………………. 0.33%
The point here is that our mainstream media continues to spin these figures (for liberal political gain). Nothing more…it’s all about politics, and the liberals are famous for turning American against American for a vote.
(These statistics are published by Congressional Research Service, and they may be confirmed by anyone at:  http://WWW.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf )
Now ask yourself two questions:
1. ‘Why does the mainstream Print and TV Media never print or report statistics like these?’
2. ‘Why does the mainstream Print and TV Media hate the world wide web as much as they do?’
< /B> Be sure you do your homework before you place your vote.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/massie-obamas-no-like/	Why I Do Not Like The Obamas, an Opinion by Mychal Massie	Confirmed Authorship				2015/03/17	"Mychal Massie – Why I do not like the Obama’s:
The other evening on my twitter, a person asked me why I didn’t like the Obama’s? Specifically I was asked: “I have to ask, why do you hate the Obama’s? It seems personal, not policy related. You even dissed (disrespect) their Christmas family picture.”
The truth is I do not like the Obamas, what they represent, their ideology, and I certainly do not like his policies and legislation. I’ve made no secret of my contempt for the Obamas. As I responded to the person who asked me the aforementioned question, I don’t like them because they are committed to the fundamental change of my/our country into what can only be regarded as a Communist state.
I don’t hate them per definition, but I condemn them because they are the worst kind of racialists, they are elitist Leninists with contempt for traditional America. They display disrespect for the sanctity of the office he holds, and for those who are willing to admit same, Michelle Obama’s raw contempt for white America is transpicuous.
I don’t like them because they comport themselves as emperor and empress. I expect, no I demand respect, for the Office of President and a love of our country and her citizenry from the leader entrusted with the governance of same. President and Mrs. Reagan displayed an unparalleled love for the country and her people. The Reagan’s made Americans feel good about themselves and about what we could accomplish. His arrogance by appointing 32 leftist czars and constantly bypassing congress is impeachable. Eric Holder is probably the MOST incompetent and arrogant DOJ head to ever hold the job. Could you envision President Reagan instructing his Justice Department to act like jack-booted thugs?
Presidents are politicians and all politicians are known and pretty much expected to manipulate the truth, if not outright lie, but even using that low standard, the Obama’s have taken lies, dishonesty, deceit, mendacity, subterfuge and obfuscation to new depths. They are verbally abusive to the citizenry, and they display an animus for civility.
I do not like them, because they both display bigotry overtly, as in the case of Harvard Professor Louis Gates, when he accused the Cambridge Police of acting stupidly, and her code speak pursuant to now being able too be proud of America. I view that statement and that mindset as an insult to those who died to provide a country where a Kenyan, his illegal alien relatives, and his alleged progeny, could come and not only live freely, but rise to the highest, most powerful, position in the world. Michelle Obama is free to hate and disparage whites because Americans of every description paid with their blood to ensure her right to do same.
I have a saying, that “the only reason a person hides things, is because they have something to hide.” No president in history has spent over a million dollars to keep his records and his past sealed.
And what the two of them have shared has been proved to be lies. He lied about when and how they met, he lied about his mother’s death and problems with insurance, Michelle lied to a crowd pursuant to nearly $500,000 bank stocks they inherited from his family. He has lied about his father’s military service, about the civil rights movement, ad nausea. He lied to the world about the Supreme Court in a State of the Union address. He berated and publicly insulted a sitting Congressman. He has surrounded himself with the most rabidly, radical, socialist academicians today. He opposed rulings that protected women and children that even Planned Parenthood did not seek to support. He is openly hostile to business and aggressively hostile to Israel. His wife treats being the First Lady as her personal American Express Black Card (arguably the most prestigious credit card in the world). I condemn them because, as people are suffering, losing their homes, their jobs, their retirements, he and his family are arrogantly showing off their life of entitlement – as he goes about creating and fomenting class warfare.
I don’t like them, and I neither apologize nor retreat from my public condemnation of them and of his policies. We should condemn them for the disrespect they show our people, for his willful and unconstitutional actions pursuant to obeying the Constitutional parameters he is bound by, and his willful disregard for Congressional authority..
Dislike for them has nothing to do with the color of their skin; it has everything to do with their behavior, attitudes, and policies. And I have open scorn for their constantly playing the race card.
It is my intention to do all within my ability to ensure their reign is one term. I could go on, but let me conclude with this.. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the media for refusing to investigate them, as they did President Bush and President Clinton, and for refusing to label them for what they truly are. There is no scenario known to man, whereby a white president and his wife could ignore laws, flaunt their position, and lord over the people, as these two are permitted out of fear for their color.
As I wrote in a syndicated column titled, “Nero In The White House” – “Never in my life, inside or outside of politics, have I witnessed such dishonesty in a political leader. He is the most mendacious political figure I have ever witnessed. Even by the low standards of his presidential predecessors, his narcissistic, contumacious arrogance is unequaled. Using Obama as the bar, Nero would have to be elevated to sainthood… Many in America wanted to be proud when the first person of color was elected president, but instead, they have been witness to a congenital liar, a woman who has been ashamed of America her entire life, failed policies, intimidation, and a commonality hitherto not witnessed in political leaders. He and his wife view their life at our expense as an entitlement – while America’s people go homeless, hungry and unemployed.”

Please forward this to as many people as possible. Legislature Passes Bill for ‘Gay Day’ Celebrations in California Public Schools By Peter J. Smith
August 8, 2008, SACRAMENTO (LifeSiteNews. com) – California public schools soon will be planning ‘gay day’   celebrations every May 22 unless Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoes the legislation. Thursday the California Assembly approved AB 2567, which designates May 22 as ‘Harvey Milk Day.’ The 43 to 26 vote occurred on party lines with Democrats for, Republicans against. Earlier this week, AB 2567 passed the California State Senate on another party line vote 22-13 – Democrats for, Republicans against. The bill will require all public schools to ‘conduct suitable commemorative exercises’ in commemoration of the anti-religious, homosexualist agenda of the late San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk.  According to a Senate analysis of the bill, ‘This bill requires the Governor to proclaim May 22 as Harvey Milk Day.The designation of a day of significance triggers statutory encouragement for public schools to observe and conduct commemorative exercises suitable to the day.’ ‘This bad bill will teach impressionable schoolchildren the anti-religious, homosexual-bisexual -transsexual agenda of Harvey Milk,’ warned Randy Thomasson, President of Campaign for Children and Families. 
‘If signed into law, AB 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality, bisexuality, and transsexuality in California government schools.This will harm children as young as children as young as kindergarten. ‘ ‘The Democrats are so cocky, they have no qualms about pushing sexual indoctrination upon children in an election year.

Welcome to Maywood, Mexico 
by Roger Hedgecock 
06/25/2010 


Boasting a population that is 97% Hispanic, more than half foreign born, and 40% illegal, the Los Angeles County, Calif., incorporated city of Maywood has achieved the Reconquista goal. It is now as lawless and chaotic as any place in Mexico. Maywood is a warning to every city and town in America.  
The Maywood City Council announced this week that after years of radical policies, corruption and scandal, the city was broke and all city employees would be laid off and essential city services contracted out to neighboring cities or to L.A. County government. 
How did this happen? Until recently, Maywood was the model for “brown power” politics. 
Maywood was the first California city with an elected Hispanic City Council, one of the first “sanctuary” cities for illegal aliens, the first city to pass a resolution calling for a boycott of Arizona after that state passed a law to enforce federal immigration laws, the first California city to order its police department not to enforce state laws requiring drivers to have licenses to drive, the first American city to call on Congress to grant amnesty to all illegals. 
Council meetings were conducted in Spanish. Maywood was the leader in the peaceful, democratic achievement of the La Raza goal to take power in the U.S. 
The City of Maywood started out quite differently. Back after World War II, Maywood was a booming blue-collar town with good jobs, a multi-ethnic suburb of Los Angeles. 
On the 25th anniversary in 1949 of Maywood’s incorporation as a city, the town celebrated with a beard-growing contest, a rodeo, and wrestling matches in City Park. Chrysler operated an assembly plant there until 1971. 
But the early 1970s saw these industrial jobs in aerospace, auto and furniture manufacturing, and food processing evaporate under the pressure of higher taxes, increased local and state regulation, and the attraction of cheaper land and cheaper labor elsewhere. 
The multi-ethnic Maywood of the post-war years was transformed in the ’80s and ’90s by wave after wave of Hispanic immigrants, many of them illegal. 
In August 2006, a “Save Our State” anti-illegal immigration rally in Maywood drew hundreds of protesters—but a larger number of defenders of illegal immigration. The pro-illegal protesters carried signs which read “We are Indigenous ! The ONLY owners of this Continent!” and “Racist Pilgrims Go Home” and “All Europeans are Illegal Here.” 
According to newspaper reports at the time, objectors to illegal aliens were subject to physical attacks. A 70-year-old man was “slashed,” a woman attacked, and cars vandalized. Pro-illegal demonstrators raised the Mexican flag at the U.S. Post Office. 
The illegal population and their sympathizers became increasingly radicalized. Elections to the City Council saw “assimilationist” incumbent Hispanic council members ousted by La Raza supporting radical challengers. 
For years, the Maywood City Council authorized police checkpoints to stop drunk driving. Drivers without licenses had their cars impounded. Illegals in California cannot get drivers licenses. By 2005, the number of such impounds were in the hundreds. A community campaign was launched forcing the City Council to suspend the checkpoints. 
Cars were still being impounded whenever a police traffic-violation stop resulted in a driver without a license. Felipe Aguirre, a community activist with Comite Pro-Uno, an “immigration service center,” coordinated a new campaign against any impounds. He was elected in 2005 to the City Council. He is the mayor of Maywood today. 
Aguirre and a new majority of the council dismantled the Traffic Department. Illegals were given overnight-parking permits and impounds stopped. You didn’t need a license to drive in Maywood. The Los Angeles Times wrote glowingly of this “progress” in a story entitled “Welcome to Maywood, Where Roads Open Up For Immigrants”. 
The Maywood Police Department was restructured by the new council. A new chief and new officers were hired. Later it turned out that many of the new officers had previously been fired from other law enforcement agencies for a variety of infractions. The Maywood P.D. was known as the “Department of Second Chances.” 
Among those hired was a former L.A. Sheriff’s deputy terminated for abusing jail inmates; a former LAPD officer fired for intimidating a witness; and an ex-Huntington Park officer charged with negligently discharging a handgun and driving drunk. 
Even the L.A. Times called the Maywood Police Department a “haven for misfit cops.” Their story alleged that a veteran officer was extorting sex from relatives of a criminal fugitive; that another officer tried to run over the president of the Maywood Police Commission; and that another officer has impregnated a teenage police-explorer scout. 
Charges of corruption and favoritism led to one recall of city council members and threats of more recalls are heard to this day. 
Maywood is represented in the state Senate by Democrat “One Bill” Gil Cedillo. He earned the nickname by introducing every year in the state legislature a bill to grant drivers licenses to illegals. Maywood is represented in Congress by Democrat Lucille Roybal-Allard, a staunch advocate of amnesty for illegals. 
Today, Maywood is broke. Its police department dismantled along with all other city departments and personnel. Only the city council remains and a city manager to manage the contracts with other agencies for city services in Maywood.  
Maywood is the warning of what happens when illegal immigrants, resisting assimilation as Americans, bring with their growing numbers the corruption and the radical politics of their home countries. Add the radical home-grown anti-Americanism of Hispanic “leaders” and groups like La Raza and you get schools where learning is replaced with indoctrination, business and jobs replaced by welfare and gangs, and a poisonous stew of entitlement politics. 
In too many American communities, this sad tale is all too familiar.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/mark-arnolds/	Pastor Mark Arnold Meets McCain and Palin	Reported to be Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
This past Tuesday, the McCain / Palin Bus came through a little town called, Lebanon, Ohio. The LORD allowed me to go to the Rally giving them a message that He wanted me to personally deliver. 
Sunday Night – a burden hit me that would only shake me to my knees – I prayed and wept for our Nation. Never has my heart been so broken before God. I literally interceded for these wonderful people who do not deserve all the hate against them. The GOD-Haters are going to try everything to stop them, but they will not succeed! 
God is not pleased with the ‘bashing’ in the News of this ‘Anointed’ person. He has called her for this time! I promised God that I would pray and hold them up in prayer. I would ‘listen’ out and be mindful of where they were. The following day is important in this time-line…because I didn’t even know until God spoke to me… 
Monday and into Monday Night – the burden of prayer was so heavy that I was literally shaking and could not stop weeping. I didn’t know that they were coming to Ohio. I prayed and walked and wept and walked. I prayed and prayed and wept and prayed… 
Tuesday at 2:00 A.M. – God spoke these words to me – ‘…Go turn the Radio on!’ Immediately the the Reporter’s Words were – ‘McCain & Palin Bus to be in Lebanon later this morning for a 10:00 A.M. Rally!’ 
Immediately on hearing that news, I heard God again… 
God said, ‘You are to go. You will meet them and give them a message for Me!’ 
I prayed as an intercessor and went to a place in prayer that I don’t think I’ve ever been…because the LORD had just visited me…and I knew I was on a ‘Mission.’ I had now been up since Sunday Night…and now it’s Tuesday and I’ve got to go on the ‘WORD of the LORD.’  He sure became My Strength as this unfolds… 
I didn’t stop praying until I drove over to the town and parked the car. The News would later report they were expecting 5,000 people and the actual head-count of those who had been scanned was more than 10,000 people. 
I simply obeyed…and God actually told me where to stand, who to talk to…and when to be on the move. I had sure learned on the Mission Field, when God wants to open a door, He will do it at the appropriate time. He always has someone to assist…and even those standing beside you may just be an Angel.  
I struck up a conversation with an agent on the ground – he simply said, ‘I can’t allow you to stand here!’ Here is where the bus was going to actual pull up to. They had to make a much larger perimeter so the entire area was now being moved back several blocks. The only other thing he told me to do was to go through the metal detector zone and just watch from the back. So, that’s what I did. 
Due to sensitivity of the internet…I can’t share much of the story as to what happened next was a definite GOD THING ALL THE WAY. 
Looking over the shoulders and backs and heads of all those people…I knew it would take a miracle for what GOD told me to do. 
As I was standing there, two Boy Scouts came running up my back…literally, they almost knocked me to the ground because they were running so fast behind me…up my back and over to the right. These Boy Scouts were about Junior High Age. Their Scout Leader and several others were behind them…but as the two out front was trying to push through the crowd, saying they were late…the smaller scouts were left in the dust. The Scout Leader who was with a McCain Rep from the State grabbed me and told me bring the other Scouts up front as they try to keep up with the first two that just came through. 
I just became the leader of the rest of the Scouts to lead them right up front and center. As the Rep was shouting back at me…to bring the Scouts forward…the people parted just like God parted the Red Sea. 
I marched them boys right up front and to the right of the stage as one was looking from the back. When I got there I was fifteen feet from the podium. GOD said, ‘Stand here, and don’t move from this spot.’ 
Within five minutes…the bus pulled up and around the other side McCain, Sarah Palin and her husband Todd stepped up and the speeches took off. I was where God placed me…and even Sarah Palin and Todd were standing on my side of the stage. I made eye contact, I gave them thumbs up gestures…and I knew they were just happy to see me standing there. Ha Ha 
When they came around the podium and started on the other side, I knew they were coming right toward me, a little lady who stood by me, reached up and told the Rep that they had promised a Picture with her because she was the one who had lost a son in Iraq, recently. The Rep confirmed she would get a pic with them and they would talk to her. When McCain came to hug her… he immdiately shook my hand and following his moment with her, I shook his hand as he grabbed my hand, now for the second time, and I said, ‘God wants you to know that I’m praying for you, Sir!’ He thanked me and kept smiling. I repeated that phrase to him five times. He grabbed my hands and looked right into my eyes and said, ‘I won’t make it without prayer. Sir, Thank You for praying for me, and don’t let one day go by that you don’t pray for me. I need all the prayers that I can get. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!’ 
As he moved to my right, Sarah Palin, came over to my left side…standing over the crowd and then looking at the little lady who had lost the son. It took a moment for her to shake some hands and people were pushing in all around. Sarah came and got on her hands and knees on that side of the stage and hugged that little Mom, telling her, ‘…it was not in vain.’ She promised her support. 
It was at this moment Sarah Palin, reached out for me to help her up and as I was assisting her to stand I was now face to face with her and GOD said, ‘Open up your Mouth and I will fill it.’ 
Here is what came out… 
‘God wants you to know that you are a present day Esther!’ [She immdiately began to cry]! ‘God wants to tell you that you are Chosen for such a time as this!’ ‘You are called, and chosen to be a leader.’ ‘Don’t lose heart and don’t fear man.’ ‘The news and nay-sayers and criticizers are going to be very hateful toward you… and in the days ahead they are going to turn up the heat…but do not fear.’ ‘You are a present day Esther.’ You are an Esther. You are an Esther! ‘Keep your eyes on GOD and know that He has chosen you to Reign!’  
‘Stay strong…be strong…don’t tire. Don’t be weary in well-doing. Be strong.’ 
Her husband Todd came over and I told him what I told her. He began to cry. I emphasized the fact that he was to guard her at this time…and know that ‘…she is GOD-CALLED and GOD-ANOINTED.’ 
‘…this is a GOD-THING and your wife is a Present day Esther…she is for God to use at this time…She is an Esther…she is an Esther…she is an Esther.’ 
‘You will be hated…but stand strong…GOD has called both of you to stand!’ ‘We are praying and I am praying for you…!’ 
At this moment, McCain came right to where I was finishing talking to Todd and I told Mr. McCain exactly what I told to Sarah and Todd Palin. 
‘Mr. McCain, …they are called of God and she is an Esther.’ ‘Don’t lose hope and don’t lose heart.’ 
‘We are praying for all of you!’ 
He shook my hand and with a deep look of understanding what I had just said, he said, ‘Thank you for your prayers and support…I really do mean that!’ And he turned and shook more hands…and I watched them as they went through the crowd. 
Then I got to my car I sat there for quite a long time…knowing the GOD of the Universe had just used me to deliver a message confirming to Sarah and Todd to realize they are truly chosen vessels of God. 
I wept. I have not stopped praying and crying My heart is full knowing they had to have all the staging and all the hype and all the crowd…but the GOD of Heaven and Earth…wanted to give them a Divine-God-Appointment! 
To God be all the GLORY and HONOR.
If anyone wants to know if I believe God can speak. Yes…Absolutely, is my Answer! 
Be praying for me…and let me know what you think about all of this. 
Burdened for all of our Leaders!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/montana-town-hall/	Anonymous Report From a Presidential Town Hall Meeting in Montana	Truth! and Unproven!				2015/03/17	" 
This comes from a friend’s relative who lives in MT. 
 Hello All,
 By now you have probably heard that President Obama came to Montana last Friday. However, there are many things that the major news has not covered. I feel that since Joe and I live here and we were at the airport on Friday I should share some facts with you. Whatever you decide to do with the information is up to you. If you chose to share this email with others I do ask that you DELETE my email address before you forward this on.
 On Wednesday, August 5th it was announced locally that the President would be coming here. There are many groups here that are against his healthcare and huge spending so those groups began talking and deciding on what they were going to do. The White House would not release ANY details other than the date.
 On about Tuesday Joe found out that they would be holding the “Town Hall” at the airport. (This is only because Joe knows EVERYONE at the airport) Our airport is actually located outside of Belgrade (tiny town) in a very remote location. Nothing is around there. They chose to use a hangar that is the most remotely located hangar. You could not pick a more remote location, and you can not get to it easily. It is totally secluded from the public.
 FYI: We have many areas in Belgrade and Bozeman which could have held a large amount of folks with sufficient parking. (gymnasiums/auditoriums). All of which have chairs and tables, and would not have to be SHIPPED IN!! $$$$$
 During the week, cargo by the TONS was being shipped in constantly. Airport employees could not believe how it just kept coming. Though it was our President coming several expressed how excessive it was, especially during a recession. $$$$$ 
 Late Tuesday/early Wednesday the 12th, they said that tickets would be handed out on Thursday 9am at two locations and the president would be arriving around 12:30 Friday.
 Thursday morning about 600 tickets were passed out. However, 1500 were printed at a Local printing shop per White House request. Hmmmm……900 tickets just DISAPPEARED.
 This same morning someone called into the radio from the local UPS branch and said that THOUSANDS of Dollars of Lobster were shipped in for Obama. Montana has some of the best beef in the nation!!! And it would have been really wonderful to help out the local economy. Anyone heard of the Recession?? Just think…with all of the traveling the White House is doing. $$$$$ One can only imagine what else we are paying for.
 On Friday Joe and I got out to the airport about 10:45am. The groups that wanted to protest Obama’s spending and healthcare had gotten a permit to protest and that area was roped off. But that was not to be. A large bus carrying SEIU (Service Employees International Union) members drove up onto the area (illegal) and unloaded right there. It was quite a commotion and there were specifically 2 SEIU men trying to make trouble and start a fight. Police did get involved and arrested the one man but they said they did not have the manpower to remove the SEIU crowd. 
 The SEIU crowd was very organized and young. About 99% were under the age of 30 and they were not locals! They had bullhorns and PROFESSIONALLY made signs. Some even wore preprinted T-shirts. Oh, and Planned Parenthood folks were with them…..professing abortion rights with their T-shirts and preprinted signs. (BTW, all these folks did have a permit to protest in ANOTHER area)
 Those against healthcare/spending moved away from the SEIU crowd to avoid confrontation. They were orderly and respectful. Even though SEIU kept coming over and walking through, continuing to be very intimidating and aggressive at the direction of the one SEIU man.
 So we had Montana folks from ALL OVER the state with their homemade signs and their DOGS with homemade signs. We had cowboys, nurses, doctors you name it. There was even a guy from Texas who had been driving through. He found out about the occasion, went to the store, made a sign, and came to protest.
 If you are wondering about the press…..Well, all of the major networks were over by that remote hangar I mentioned. They were conveniently parked on the other side of the buildings FAR away. None of these crowds were even visible to them. I have my doubts that they knew anything about the crowds.
 We did have some local news media around us from this state and Idaho. Speaking of the local media…they were invited. However, all questions were to be turned into the White House in advance of the event. Wouldn’t want anyone to have to think off the top of their head.
 It was very obvious that it was meant to be totally controlled by the White House. Everything was orchestrated down to the last detail to make it appear that Montana is just crazy for Obama and government healthcare. Even those people that talked about their insurance woes……..the White House called our local HRDC (Human Resource and Development Committee) and asked for names. Then the White House asked those folks to come. Smoke and mirrors…EVERYTHING was staged!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I am very dismayed about what I learned about our current White House. The amount of control and manipulation was unbelievable. I felt I was not living in the United States of America, more like the USSR!! I was physically nauseous. Joe and I have been around when Presidents or Heads of State visit. It has NEVER been like this. I am truly very frightened for our country. America needs your prayers and your voices. If you care about our country please get involved. Know the issues. And let Congress hear your voices again and again!! If they are willing to put forth so much effort to BULLY a small town one can only imagine what is going on in Washington DC. Scary!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ap-obama-case/	Associated Press Story About Obama Citizenship Case Reaching SupremeCourt	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Read and you decide if this is true or not…. VERY QUIETLY OBAMA’S CITIZENSHIP CASE REACHES THE SUPREME COURT.
 Just researched : Apparently Hawaii had until August 8, 2011, to produce documents and open the books for a full investigation. This order was delivered on July 5, 2011, under a direct order of the Supreme Court.
 VERY QUIETLY OBAMA’S CITIZENSHIP CASE REACHES THE SUPREME COURT  AP – WASHINGTON D.C. – 
 In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama’s qualifications for the presidency, the group “Americans for Freedom of Information” has Released copies of President Obama’s college transcripts from Occidental College.
 Now released, the transcript school indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California.
 The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship.
 This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama’s detractors have been seeking. Along with the evidence that he was first born in Kenya and there is no record of him ever applying for US citizenship, this is looking pretty grim. 
 The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama’s legitimacy and qualification to serve as President in an article titled, “Obama Eligibility Questioned,” which led some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama’s first official visit to the U.K.          
 In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama’s legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey .
 This lawsuit claims Obama’s dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president.. Donofrio’s case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama’s citizenship or qualification to serve as president.
 Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama’s campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records.
 Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. Attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter…
 LET OTHERS KNOW THIS NEWS, THE MEDIA WON’T ! 
 Subject RE: Issue of Passport?  Paul Hollrah at FSM asked and believes the issue can be resolved by Obama answering one simple question: What passport did Obama use when he was shuttling between New York , Jakarta , and Karachi ?
 So how did a young man who arrived in New York in early June 1981, without the price of a hotel room in his pocket, suddenly come up with the price of a round-the-world trip just a month later?
 And once he was on a plane, shuttling between New York , Jakarta , and Karachi , what passport was he offering when he passed through Customs and Immigration?
 The American people not only deserve to have answers to these questions, they must have answers. It makes the debate over Obama’s citizenship a rather short and simple one.
 Q: Did he travel to Pakistan in 1981, at age 20?  A : Yes, by his own admission.  Q: What passport did he travel under?  A : There are only three possibilities:  1) He traveled with a U.S. Passport,  2) He traveled with a British passport, or  3) He traveled with an Indonesia passport.  Q: Is it possible that Obama traveled with a U.S. Passport in 1981?  A: No. It is not possible. Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department’s “no travel” list in 1981. 
 Conclusion: When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981, he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport. If he were traveling with a British passport, that would provide proof that he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims.
 And if he were traveling with an Indonesian passport, that would tend to prove that he relinquished whatever previous citizenship he held, British or American, prior to being adopted by his Indonesian step-father in 1967.
 Whatever the truth of the matter, the American people need to know how he managed to become a “natural born” American citizen between 1981 and 2008.
 Given the destructive nature of his plans for America, as illustrated by his speech before Congress and the disastrous spending plan he has presented to Congress, the sooner we learn the truth of all this, the better.
 If you Don’t care that Your President is not a natural born Citizen and in Violation of the Constitution, then Delete this, and then lower your American Flag to half-staff, because the U.S. Constitution is already on life-support, and won’t survive much longer.
 If you do care then Forward this to as many patriotic Americans as you can, because our country�s future is truly in grave danger and needs your attention and active support.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hot-mike-obama-4th-07102013/	Open Microphone Catches POTUS in Unpatriotic Moment	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Friday, July 5, 2013
Obama’s “hot mike” comments
(WASHINGTON) — A “hot mic” has apparently picked up some very unflattering words from President Obama this Fourth of July, and may plunge him deeper into some very hot water.
“Hot” or “open mics” frequently catch public figures unknowingly expressing their true feelings, usually with colorful language (prime example: in 2000, then presidential candidate George W. Bush was caught complaining to vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney that a reporter covering their campaign was a “major league asshole”). However Obama’s “slip” while exiting the balcony of the White House after his fifth Independence Day address may well exceed the average “hot mic faux pas.”
The smaller of Obama’s two microphones, which was clipped inches below Obama’s shirt collar, was supposed to have been turned off immediately after his closing remarks to guests and reporters on the White House lawn. But the microphone remained “hot,” catching the President muttering:
“God, this holiday sucks! All this national pride shit get’s on my nerves.”
Obama’s candid comments are sure to further drag down his approval ratings, as recent scandals involving the IRS, the Benghazi terrorist attacks, and massive spying on average citizens by the NSA have sunk Obama’s approval numbers below that of former president George W. Bush. It took Obama thirty seconds before he completely exited the White House balcony and removed his microphone, during which it picked up more utterances by the Commander-in-Chief, none of which pundits view will help his ratings any time soon.
“You’d think we’d stop celebrating the birth of the worst imperial power in history –but nooooo…we have to do this flag-waving bullshit every year,” Obama muttered more as he made his way from the podium. “I can’t believe I have to miss a good day of golf for this crap!”
Although Obama’s presumably inaudible words were not heard nearly as loudly as his official Independence Day speech, a few reporters and attendees close to the speakers beneath the White House balcony heard him distinctly.
PASS THIS ON TO ALL THE OBAMA VOTERS…

https://www.truthorfiction.com/turtle-island-mccain/	My Holiday With John McCain	Unproven!				2015/03/17	" 
MY HOLIDAY WITH JOHN McCAIN  
It was just before John McCain’s last run at the presidential nomination in 2000 that my husband and I vacationed in Turtle Island in Fiji with John McCain, Cindy, and their children, including Bridget (their adopted Bangladeshi child). 
 It was not our intention, but it was our misfortune to be in close quarters with John McCain for almost a week, since Turtle Island has a small number of bungalows and their focus on communal meals force all vacationers who are there at the same time to get to know each other intimately. 
 McCain arrived at our first group meal and started reading quotes from a pile of William Faulkner books with a forest of Post-Its sticking out of them. As an English Literature major myself, my first thought was “if he likes this so much, why hasn’t he memorized any of this yet?” I soon realized that McCain actually thought we had come on vacation to be a volunteer audience for his “readings” which then became a regular part of each meal. Out of politeness, none of the vacationers initially protested at this intrusion into their blissful holiday, but people’s buttons definitely got pushed as the readings continued day after day. 
 Unfortunately this was not his only contribution to our mealtime entertainment. He waxed on during one meal about how Indo-Chine women had the best figures and that our American corn-fed women just couldn’t meet up to this standard. He also made it a point that all of us should stop Cindy from having dessert as her weight was too high and made a few comments to Amy, the 25 year old wife of the honeymooning couple from Nebraska that she should eat less as she needed to lose weight.  
McCain’s appreciation of the beauty of Asian women was so great that David the American economist had to move his Thai wife to the other side of the table from McCain as McCain kept aggressively flirting with and touching her. 
Needless to say I was irritated at his large ego and his rude behavior towards his wife and other women, but decided he must have some redeeming qualities as he had adopted a handicapped child from Bangladesh . I asked him about this one day, and his response was shocking: “Oh, that was Cindy’s idea – I didn’t have anything to do with it. She just went and adopted this thing without even asking me. You can’t imagine how people stare when I wheel this ugly, black thing around in a shopping cart in Arizona . No, it wasn’t my idea at all.” 
 I actively avoided McCain after that, but unfortunately one day he engaged me in a political discussion which soon got us on the topic of the active US bombing of Iraq at that time. I was shocked when he said, “If I was in charge, I would nuke Iraq to teach them a lesson”. Given McCain’s personal experience with the horrors of war, I had expected a more balanced point of view. I commented on the tragic consequences of the nuclear attacks on Japan during WWII — but no, he was not to b e dissuaded. He went on to say that if it was up to him he would have dropped many more nuclear bombs on Japan . I rapidly extricated myself from this conversation as I could tell that his experience being tortured as a POW didn’t seem to have mellowed out his perspective, but rather had made him more aggressive and vengeful towards the world. 
 My final encounter with McCain was on the morning that he was leaving Turtle Island . Amy and I were happily eating pancakes when McCain arrived and told Amy that she shouldn’t be having pancakes because she needed to lose weight. Amy burst into tears at this abusive comment. I felt fiercely protective of Amy and immediately turned to McCain and told him to leave her alone. He became very angry and abusive towards me, and said, “Don’t you know who I am.” I looked him in the face and said, “Yes, you are the biggest asshole I have ever met” and headed back to my cabin. I am happy to say that later that day when I arrived at lunch I was given a standing ovation by all the guests for having stood up to McCain’s bullying. 

Although I have shared my McCain story informally with friends, this is the first time I am making this public. I almost did so in 2000, when McCain first announced his bid for the Republican nomination, but it soon became apparent that George Bush was the shoo-in candidate and so I did not act then. However, now that there is a very real possibility that McCain could be elected as our next president, I feel it is my duty as an American citizen to share this story. I can’t imagine a more scary outcome for America than that this abusive, aggressive man should lead our nation. I have observed him in intimate surroundings as he really is, not how the media portrays him to be. I f his attitudes toward women and his treatment of his own family are even a small indicator of his real personality, then I shudder to think what will happen to America were he to be elected as our President.

House Republicans Schedule Obama Impeachment Hearings
 GOP Leaders Cite Inability to Halt Government Shutdown Republicans in the House of Representatives have scheduled impeachment proceedings against President Obama, claiming his inability to halt the federal government shutdown makes him unfit for office. 
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann introduced a resolution to impeach Obama this morning and referred the matter to the House Judiciary Committee. Senior aides close to judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte say hearings will begin Thursday. 
“I think it’s high time President Obama be held accountable for his crimes,” explains Bachmann. “For two weeks now, vital government services have been disrupted, federal workers have gone without pay and national memorials have been closed, all because of the president’s refusal to negotiate over Obamacare. 
“This isn’t just poor leadership. The Obama administration is corrupt to the core. The scandals surrounding the IRS, Benghazi, the Fast and the Furious (sic) and Solyndra have shown us this cabal will do anything to stay in power. 
“But in shutting down the government President Obama has committed economic treason against the United States of America, and he must be removed before it’s too late. The Constitution provides us the mechanism of impeachment. It’s time to end this dictatorial regime and return the presidency back to the American people.”
Sour Tea The U.S. federal government shut down on Oct. 1 after House Republicans refused to fund it unless President Obama agreed to repeal his signature health care reform, the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. 
Although most polls show that a majority of Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown, many in the Tea Party feel President Obama is at fault for not immediately acquiescing to their demands. 
“The tipping point for me was closing the World War II memorial,” says Texas Republican Louie Gohmert, who voted for the bill which effectively shut down the government. “I can’t believe Obama did that. I mean how dare he put politics ahead of our veterans. 
“All this clown needs to do is repeal the most important law he ever passed, and then this will all be over. Why is that so hard? The Tea Party represents almost 22 percent of Americans. Only a dictator would refuse to give us everything we want. Obama should be more than impeached — he should be in jail.”  
Hearings in the judiciary committee are expected to last for two weeks, after which the committee will create specific impeachment charges and refer them to the full House. If a majority of House members vote to impeach the President, the matter is referred to the Senate, where he will face trial. The Senate’s Democratic majority makes ultimate success unlikely. 
“We probably won’t be successful,” admits Ted Cruz, one of the few Republicans in the Senate supporting the impeachment process. “But we have to try. This guy is worse than Hitler. We have to do something.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/meet-lepage/	Meet Maine ‘s New Governor Paul R. LePage	Opinion!				2015/03/17	"Meet Maine ‘s New Governor—In case you haven’t heard about this guy before, his name will stick in your mind, Paul R. LePage!
The new Maine Governor, is making New Jersey ‘s Chris Christie look timid. He isn’t afraid to say what he thinks. Judging by the comments, every time he opens his mouth, his popularity goes up.
He brought down the house at his inauguration when he shook his fist toward the media box and said, “You’re on notice! I’ve inherited a financially troubled State to run. Observe…cover what we do…but don’t whine if I don’t waste time responding to your every whim just for your amusement.”
During his campaign for Governor, he was talking to commercial fishermen who are struggling because of federal fisheries rules. They complained that Obama brought his family to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park for a long Labor Day holiday and found time to meet with union leaders, but wouldn’t talk to the fishermen. LePage replied, “I’d tell him to go to hell and get out of my State.” The Lame Stream Media crucified LePage, but he jumped 6 points in the pre-election poll.
The NAACP specifically asked LePage to spend Martin Luther King Day visiting black inmates at the Maine State Prison. He told them that he would meet with ALL inmates, regardless of race, if he were to visit the prison. The NAACP balked and then put out a news release claiming falsely that he refused to participate in any MLK events. He read it in the paper for the 1st time the next morning while being driven to an event and went ballistic because none of the reporters had called him for comment before running the NAACP release.
He arrived at that event & said in front of a TV camera, “If they want to play the race card on me they can kiss my ass”, and he reminded them that he has an adopted black son from Jamaica and that he attended the local MLK Breakfast every year that he was mayor of Waterville. (He started his morning there on MLK Day.)
He then stated that there’s a right way and a wrong way to meet with the Governor, and he put all special interests on notice that press releases, media leaks, and all demonstrations would prove to be the wrong way. He said any other group, which acted like the NAACP could expect to be at the bottom of the Governor’s priority list!
He then did the following, and judging from local radio talk show callers, his popularity increased even more: The State employees union complained because he waited until 3 P.M. Before closing State offices and facilities and sending non-emergency personnel home during the last blizzard. The prior Governor would often close offices for the day with just a forecast before the first flakes. (Each time the State closes for snow, it costs the taxpayers about $1 million in wages for no work in return.)
LePage was CEO of the Marden’s chain of discount family bargain retail stores before election as governor. He noted that State employees getting off work early could still find lots of retail stores open to shop. So, he put the State employees on notice by announcing: “If Marden’s is open, Maine is open!”
He told State employees: “We live in Maine in the winter, for heaven’s sake, and should know how to drive in it. Otherwise, apply for a State job in Florida !”
Governor LePage symbolizes what America needs; Refreshing politicians who aren’t self-serving and who exhibit common sense.
THE LAW IS THE LAW!
This is one of the better e-mails I have received in a long time! I hope this makes its way around the USA several times over!!!!!HERE IS WHAT Governor LePage said,
“THE LAW IS THE LAW So “if” the US government determines that it is against the law for the words “under God” to be on our money, then, so be it.
And “if” that same government decides that the “Ten Commandments” are not to be used in or on a government installation, then, so be it.
I say, “so be it,” because I would like to be a law abiding US citizen
I say, “so be it,” because I would like to think that smarter people than I are in positions to make good decisions.
I would like to think that those people have the American public’s best interests at heart.
BUT, he said, “YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I’D LIKE?
Since we can’t pray to God, can’t Trust in God and cannot post His Commandments in Government buildings, I don’t believe Government (Federal, State and Local) and its employees should participate in Easter and Christmas celebrations which honor the God that our government is eliminating from many facets of American life.
I’d like my mail delivered on Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving & Easter. After all, it’s just another day.
I’d like the” US Supreme Court to be in session on Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving & Easter as well as Sundays.” After all, it’s just another day.
I’d like the Senate and the House of Representatives to not have to worry about getting home for the “Christmas Break.” After all it’s just another day.
I’m thinking a lot of my taxpayer dollars could be saved, if all government offices & services would work on Christmas, Good Friday & Easter. It shouldn’t cost any overtime since those would be just like any other day of the week to a government that is trying to be “politically correct.”
In fact….I think our government should work on Sundays (AFTER ALL, It was initially set aside for worshipping God….) because, AFTER ALL, our government says that it should be Just ANOTHER DAY….”
What do you all think???? If this idea gets to enough people, maybe our elected officials will stop giving in to the “minority opinions” and begin, once again, to represent the “majority” of ALL of the American people.
If this gets around the country a few times, perhaps we will see better days!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/mccain-son/	John McCain's Marine Son	Truth!  But Obama quote is Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
 McCain’s Sons 
Talk about putting your most valuable where your mouth is! Apparently this was not “newsworthy” enough for the media to comment about. Can either of the other presidential candidates truthfully come close to this? … Just a question for each of us to seek an answer, and not a statement. 
 You see…character is what’s shown when the public is not looking. There were no cameras or press invited to what you are about to read about, and the story comes from one person in New Hampshire. 
 One evening last July, Senator John McCain of Arizona arrived at the New Hampshire home of Erin Flanagan for sandwiches, chocolate-chip cookies and a heartfelt talk about Iraq. They had met at a presidential debate, when she asked the candidates what they would do to bring home American soldiers -soldiers like her brother, who had been killed in action a few months earlier. 
 Mr. McCain did not bring cameras or press. Instead, he brought his youngest son, James McCain, 19, then a private first class in the Marine Corps about to leave for Iraq. Father and son sat down to hear more about Ms. Flanagan’s brother Michael Cleary, a 24-year-old Army First Lieutenant killed by an ambush … a roadside bomb. 
 No one mentioned the obvious: In just days, Jimmy McCain could face similar perils. ‘I can’t imagine what it must have been like for them as they were coming to meet with a family that ……’ Ms. Flanagan recalled, choking up. ‘We lost a dear one,’ she finished. 
 Mr. McCain, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has staked his candidacy on the promise that American troops can bring stability to Iraq. What he almost never says is that one of them is his own son, who spent seven months patrolling Anbar Province and learned of his father’s New Hampshire victory in January while he was digging a stuck military vehicle out of the mud. 
 Two of Jimmy’s three older brothers went into the military. Doug McCain,  48, was a Navy pilot. Jack McCain, 21, is to graduate from the Naval Academy next year, raising the chances that his father, if elected, could become the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower with a son at war. 
 I chose to share this with those who I believe will pass it on, to others who will pass it on. We hear so much inflated trash out there. How about a simple act of kindness … and dedication to others placed above oneself? 
 Has anybody heard if Barack Hussein Obama has served in The American Armed Services? 
 This is for all you Barack voters. 
 From Barack’s book, Audacity of Hope: 
 “I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.” 
 HE DID NOT SAY STAND WITH AMERICANS!!!!!

Purge of Military Commanders?
On October 12, 2013, ABC’s Dianne Sawyer brought us a video of a 9th, yes 9th, General fired from the military this week. It’s even reaching some of the more liberal stations and begging them to ask the question, “What is going on?” It seems President Obama is preparing what he calls “my military” for his version of the final solution. With all the documentation we have, it looks as though he is purging the military for the next step. 
We have now seen this official President Obama temper-tantrum in action this week. But is it a temper-tantrum or is there a method to his madness? 
We have been warned by a Pentagon Official to expect radical changes. You heard of our dire warnings of Chinese Economists planning to foreclose and forming the TPP Treaty that could set a global economy in motion. We have the very real possibility of 16 U.S. States being shut-down and handed over due to debt in this mess. We even have a CIA whistle blower warning us that President Obama wants to radically take over power. People are crying out, where is our military in this mess? 
Well, there seems to be some very credible evidence that since last year and through this year that there has been a “litmus test” given to American Military Officers. The Main point of that test, “Would you fire on an American Citizen?” If you say no, then as Donald Trump would say, “Your fired!” Since the beginning of the year these retired officers have come forward with ““President Obama is preparing for war against the U.S. ”. We even know Dr. Garrow and others confirmed this litmus test. 
Then we have heard President Obama himself talk about “My Military”. 
And this isn’t all. This strange chain of firings from the Military is so bizarre and so unheard of that even Dianne Sawyer of ABC news reached out to cover it when the 9th, yes 9th, Military Commanding Officer was relieved of duty in less than a year. This doesn’t include the long list last year, this is just the nine individuals this year alone. 
General Carter Hamm, United States Army-Served as head of the United States African Command. Was in charge of the US African command during the fateful night of September 11, 2012 when the lives of four American citizens was taken in the Embassy in Benghazi . Hamm was extremely critical of our Commander and Chief and stated he lied about not having reinforcements in the area on that night. Hamm “resigned and retired” on April of 2013. 
Rear Admiral Charles Gaouette/ United States Navy-Commander of Carrier Strike Group Three. His most recent activity served as Deputy Commander of the US Naval Forces, US Central Command. He was in charge of Air Craft Carriers in the Mediterranean Sea the night of September 11, 2012. He testified before the hearing committee and said that there may not have been time to get the flight crews there but left the door open on if told when the events took place if that he could have had the aircraft launched upon cross-examination by Rep. Tray Gowdey. Recently fired from the Administrative post and relieved of Duty by the Obama Administration for “utterance of a racial slur”. 
Major General Ralph Baker, United States Army- Major General Baker served as the Commander of the Joint Task Force-Horn at Camp Lamar , Djibouti , Africa . Was also involved in some aspect with the incident September 11, 2012, being under the African Command. Had said he believed attack helicopters could have made it in time. Relieved of command and fired for groping a civilian (no assault charges or sexual misconduct charges filed with JAG) 
Brigadier General Bryan Roberts, United States Army-General Roberts took command of Fort Jackson in 2011. Was considered a rising star in his field. He served in Iraq during his service as the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, and was the Deputy Commanding General of the United States Army Recruiting Command, Fort Knox , KY. Relieved of Duty and Fired for Adultery. While this is still on the books in the United States Code of Military Justice, it has rarely been used since President Bill Clinton’s indiscretions. 
Major General Gregg A. Sturdevant, United States Marine Corps-Director of Strategic Planning and Policy of for the United States Pacific Command and Commander of the aviation wing at Camp Bastion , Afghanistan . Highly decorated soldier with two Naval and Marine Commendations and two Naval and Marine Good Conduct medals. He also has an Air Medal with a gold star. He served honorably and distinctively. He had asked about supplies to his command. He was one of two commanding officers suddenly relieved of command and fired from the military for failure of proper force protection. 
Major General Charles M.M. Gurganus, United States Marine Corps- Regional Commander in the Southwest and I Marine Expeditionary Force (a forward or frontal division) in Afghanistan. Also Highly decorated with a Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legion of Merritt w/Valor, and three Meritorious Service Commendations. Major General C.M.M. Gurganus had questioned the use of Afghanistan patrols along side American patrols after two officers were executed at their desk and a platoon was lead into an ambush on the front lines. Was the other commander relieved of duty for failure of proper force protection. 
Lieutenant General David Holmes Huntoon Jr, United States Army-Served as the 58th Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. He had graduated from the same academy in 1973 and had served in Senior Planning and Education Services through the majority of his career. He was “censored” for “an investigation” into an “improper relationship” according to The Department of Defense. Nothing was released to the nature of the improper relationship. Nothing was even mentioned if an actual investigation even took place. 
Vice Admiral Tim Giardina, United States Navy-Deputy Commander of the United States Strategic Command. Commander of the Submarine Group Trident, Submarine Group 9 and Submarine Group 10, where every single one of the 18 Nuclear Submarines with Nuclear Trident Missiles of those three groups were in his command. This commander earned six Legions of Merit, Two Meritorious Service Medals, two Joint Service Commendation Medals, and several other medals, ribbons and decorations in his illustrious career. He was removed from service and fired from the military for the charge of using counterfeit poker chips (not making that up). 
Last on the list, Major General Michael Carry, United States Air Force-Commander 20th Air Force in charge of 9,600 people and 450 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) at three operational wings and served in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. He was Fired October 11, 2013, for “Personal Misbehavior” is what was told to ABC News. He and Giardina were both the two top Commanders over the United States Nuclear Arsenal before their dismissal within 48 hours of each other. 
As ABC News reports, this is an extremely alarming rate and
one of the biggest and fastest purges of military personnel ever recorded. It apparently is such a shock at the rate even for a long time veteran of reporting the news as Dianne Sawyer, because at one point she gets heated saying two Commanders of the Nuclear Command. 
You don’t put people who are not very intelligent and without a squeaky clean record over that area of the Military. It is enough to make the hardest and staunchest of supporters as the ABC news crew to pause and ask themselves, “what step is he planning?”
Another version:

Since Barack Obama has been in the White House, high ranking military officers have been removed from their positions at a rate that is absolutely unprecedented. Things have gotten so bad that a number of retired generals are publicly speaking out about the ‘purg’ of the U.S. military that they believe is taking place. As you will see below, dozens of highly decorated military leaders have been dismissed from their positions over the past few years. So why is this happening? What is going on right now is absolutely crazy especially during a time of peace. Is there a deliberate attempt to reshape the military and remove those who don’t adhere to the proper ‘viewpoints’ ? Does someone out there feel a need to get officers that won’t cooperate out of the way?  Throughout world history, whatever comes next after a military purge is never good.  If this continues, what is the U.S. military going to look like in a few years?  Perhaps you are reading this and you think that ‘purge’ is too strong a word for what is taking place. Well, justconsider the following quotes from some very highly decorated retired officers:  -Retired Army Major General Paul Vallely: The White House protects their own. That’s why they stalled on the investigation into fast and furious, Benghazi and Obamacare. He’s intentionally weakening and gutting our military, Pentagon and reducing us as a superpower, and anyone in the ranks who disagrees or speaks out is being purged.  -Retired Army Major General Patrick Brady: There is no doubt he (Obama) is intent on emasculating the military and will fire anyone who disagrees with him. -Retired Army Lt. General William G. Jerry Boykin: Over the past three years, it is unprecedented for the number of four-star generals to be relieved of duty, and not necessarily relieved for cause.  -Retired Navy Captain Joseph John: I believe there are more than 137 officers who have been forced out or given bad evaluation reports so they will never make Flag (officer), because of their failure to comply to certain views.  A Pentagon official who asked to remain nameless because they were not authorized to speak on the matter said even young officers, down through the ranks have been told not to talk about Obama or the politics of the White House. They are purging everyone and if you want to keep your job just keep your mouth shut. Now this trend appears to be accelerating.  http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/why-are-dozens-of-high-ranking-officers-being-purged-from-the-u-s-military  General Vallely’s comment:  Absolutely every communist regime on the planet did this as soon as they got in power. I am surprised this communist traitor with his feet up on our furniture in the white house hasn’t done this until now!  SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?  I am doing my part. How about forwarding this.  Paul  (General Paul Vallely)

https://www.truthorfiction.com/mccainbaptized/	John McCain Just Got Baptized	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" WOW, THIS IS GREAT NEWS


Subject: FW: McCain Just Got Baptized by James Dobson! 
Rick, I was so shocked this morning that I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing! John McCain visited the Focus on the Family headquarters this morning for a meeting with James Dobson. We were preparing for a really intense meeting, but it turned into one of the most incredible things I’ve ever witnessed. 
After about thirty minutes of intense debate, John McCain really shared his soul with us, and after a two-hour conversation he expressed his desire to finally accept Christ and become baptized. Apparently, McCain has always gone to church but never really made a commitment. James was really caught off-guard at how genuine McCain was! We talked through it and John McCain ended up getting baptized at James Dobson’s swimming pool at his house! We had a big barbeque to celebrate. It was the craziest day I’ve ever had while working at Focus on the Family! 
We know that the media will probably twist this to make McCain sound weird, but we don’t care. This is obviously incredible and amazing, and I just wanted to pass it on. He’s definitely got my vote! Tell as many people as you can!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dick-morris-hillary-clinton-101313/	Analysis of Hillary Clinton by Dick Morris	Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	"ANALYSIS WORTH READING:
by Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill Clinton
If you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying that he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary’s background . .
beware.
As I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone, I offer a few corrections;
Bill says: “In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.”
The facts are: Hillary’s main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.
Bill says: “Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children’s rights project for poor kids.”
The facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.
Bill says: “Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.”
The facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam, yes, flunked, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, none, and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.
Bill says: “President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its chairman.”
The facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill’s support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter’s choice to be chairman.
Bill says: “She served on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital.”
The facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-mart board of directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.
Bill says: “Hillary didn’t succeed at getting heal th care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.”
The facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals’ tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.
Bill says: “Hillary was the face of America all over the world.”
The facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.
Bill says: “Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children’s and women’s issues.”
The facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico . A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer’s or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize the Woodstock fiasco of 40 years ago.
Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country (that’s you and me!) when it comes to the war on terror.
1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.
2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA .
3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.
4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.
5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.
One cannot think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror.
But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us.
Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/naacp-washington-statue/	George Washington Statue Covered to Prevent Martin Luther King CelebrantsFrom Being Offended	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
 
 
The annual MLK observance at the state house in Columbia, SC had an interesting twist this year. The event is held on the north side steps of the statehouse. Prominent at that location is a large bronze statue of George Washington. This year, the NAACP constructed a “box” to conceal the Father of His Country from view so that participants would not be offended by his presence. 


I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this picture of the MLK Day rally in Columbia, South Carolina yesterday. This rally was sponsored by the NAACP and they said that they covered the statue because they “didn’t want to offend anyone”. Really? George Washington is the father of this nation.. How is he offensive to anyone? 


Can you imagine what would happen if we covered the statue of Dr. King on President’s Day? Of course, this disgusting display of anti-Americanism wasn’t covered at all by the national media and only the local paper in Columbia had a little piece on it. It has been covered a little by the blog-world and I think the word needs to get out to the general public that this is what the NAACP is all about…..militant, hateful and racist. In doing this, they disrespected Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I bet he would be equally disgusted. Awful.

Why I Can’t Vote For Obama  By Huntley Brown 
Dear Friends, A few months ago I was asked for my perspective on Obama, I sent out an e-mail with a few points. With the election just around the corner I decided to complete my perspective. Those of you on my e-list have seen some of this before but its worth repeating.. 
First I must say who ever wins the election will have my prayer support. Obama needs to be commended for his accomplishments but I need to explain why I will not be voting for him. 
Many of my friends process their identity through their blackness. 
I process my identity through Christ. Being a Christian (a Christ follower) means he leads I follow. I can’t dictate the terms he does because he is the leader. 
I can’t vote black because I am black I have to vote Christian because that’s who I am. Christian first black second. Neither should anyone from the other ethnic groups vote because of ethnicity. 200 years from now I wont be asked if I was black or white. I will be asked if I know Jesus and accepted him as Lord and savior. 
In an election there are many issues to consider but when a society gets abortion, same-sex marriage, embryonic stem-cell research, human cloning to name a few wrong economic concerns will soon not matter. 
We need to follow Martin Luther King’s words don’t judge someone by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I don’t know Obama so all I can go off is his voting record. 
His voting record earned him the title of the most liberal senator in the US Senate in 2007. 
NATIONAL JOURNAL: Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007 (01/31/2008) 
To beat Ted Kennedy and Hilary Clinton as the most liberal senator, takes some doing.  Obama accomplished this feat in 2 short years. I wonder what would happen to America if he had four years to work with. 
There is a reason planned parenthood gives him a 100 % ratings. There is a reason the homosexual community supports him. There is a reason Ahmadinejad, Chavez, Castro, Hamas etc loves him.  There is a reason he said he would nominate liberal judges to the supreme court.  There is a reason he voted against the infanticide bill.  There is a reason he voted No on the constitutional ban of same-sex marriage.  There is a reason he voted no on partial birth abortion. There is a reason he voted no on confirming Justices Roberts and Alito. These two judges are conservatives and they have since overturned partial birth abortion. The same practice Obama wanted to continue. 
Lets take a look at the practice he wanted to continue. 
The 5 Step Partial Birth Abortion procedure  A. Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby’s leg with forceps.  (Remember this is a live baby) B. The baby’s leg is pulled out into the birth canal. C. The abortionist delivers the baby’s entire body, except for the head. D. The abortionist jams scissors into the baby’s skull. The scissors are then opened to enlarge the hole. E. The scissors are removed and a suction catheter is inserted. The child’s brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The dead baby is then removed.  God help him. 
There is a reason Obama opposed the parent notification law. 
Think about this you can’t give a kid an aspirin without parental notification but that same kid can have an abortion without parental notification. This is insane. 
There is a reason he went to Jeremiah Wright’s church for 20 years. 
Obama tells us he has good judgement but he sat under Jeremiah Wright teaching for 20 years. Now he is condemning Wrights sermons. I wonder why now? 
Obama said Jeremiah Wright led him to the Lord and discipled him. A disciple is one in training. Jesus told us in Matthew 28 v 19 – 20 Go and make disciples of all nations. This means reproduce yourself. Teach people to think like you, walk like you, talk like you believe what you believe etc. The question I have is what did Jeremiah Wright teach him? 
Would you support a White President who went to a church which has tenants that said they have a 
1. Commitment to the White Community  2. Commitment to the White Family 3. Adherence to the White Work Ethic  4. Pledge to make the fruits of all developing and acquired skills available to the White Community .  5. Pledge to Allocate Regularly, a Portion of Personal Resources for Strengthening and Supporting White Institutions  6. Pledge allegiance to all White leadership who espouse and embrace the White Value System  7. Personal commitment to embracement of the White Value System.”  Would you support a President who went to a church like that?  
Just change the word from white to black and you have the tennants of Obamas former church. If President Bush was a member of a church like this, he would be called a racist. Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton would have been marching outside.  
This kind of church is a racist church. Obama did not wake up after 20 years and just discovered he went to a racist church. The church can’t be about race. Jesus did not come for any particular race. He came for the whole world. 
A church can’t have a value system based on race. The churches value system has to be based on biblical mandate. It does not matter if its a white church or a black church its still wrong. Anyone from either race that attends a church like this would never get my vote. 
Obama’s former Pastor Jeremiah Wright is a disciple of liberal theologian James Cone, author of the 1970 book A Black Theology of Liberation. Cone once wrote: “Black theology refuses to accept a God who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community. If God is not for us and against white people, then he is a murderer, and we had better kill him. 
Cone is the man Obama’s mentor looks up to. Does Obama believe this? 
So what does all this mean for the nation? 
In the past when the Lord brought someone with the beliefs of Obama to lead a nation it meant one thing judgement. 
Read 1 Samuel 8. When Israel asked for a king. First God says 1 Samuel 8 v 9 Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do.” 
Then God says  1 Samuel 8 v 18 When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king  you have chosen, and the LORD will not answer you in that day.”  19 But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. 20 Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”  21 When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the LORD. 22 The LORD answered,
“Listen to them and give them a king.”   
Here is what we know for sure  
God is not schizophrenic 
He would not tell one person to vote for Obama and one to vote for McCain. As the scripture says a city divided against itself cannot stand, so obviously many people are not hearing from God. 
Maybe I am the one not hearing but I know God does not change and Obama contradicts many things I read in scripture so I doubt it. 
For all my friends who are voting for Obama can you really look God in the face and say Father based on your word, I am voting for Obama even though I know he will continue the genocidal practice of partial birth abortion. 
He might have to nominate three or four supreme court justices, and I am sure he will be nominating liberal judges who will be making laws that are against you. 
I also know he will continue to push for homosexual rights, even though you destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for this.I know I can look the other way because of the economy. 
I could not see Jesus agreeing with many of Obama’s positions. Finally I have two questions for all my liberal friends. 
Since we know someone’s value system has to be placed on the nation, 
1 Whose value system should be placed on the nation. 
2 Who should determine that this is the right value system for the nation? 
Blessings, Huntley Brown

https://www.truthorfiction.com/newt-911-mosque/	Commentary by Newt Gingrich Disapproving The Construction of a ProposedMosque Near Ground Zero	Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	" 
Newt Gingrich Statement on the Proposed “Cordoba House” Mosque near Ground Zero  July 21, 2010 6pm 
There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia . The time for double standards that allow Islamists to behave aggressively toward us while they demand our weakness and submission is over. 
 The proposed ” Cordoba House” overlooking the World Trade Center site – where a group of jihadists killed over 3000 Americans and destroyed one of our most famous landmarks – is a test of the timidity, passivity and historic ignorance of American elites. For example, most of them don’t understand that Cordoba House is a deliberately insulting term. It refers to Cordoba, Spain – the capital of Muslim conquerors who symbolized their victory over the Christian Spaniards by transforming a church there into the world’s third-largest mosque complex.
 Today, some of the Mosque’s backers insist this term is being used to “symbolize interfaith cooperation” when, in fact, every Islamist in the world recognizes Cordoba as a symbol of Islamic conquest. It is a sign of their contempt for Americans and their confidence in our historic ignorance that they would deliberately insult us this way. Those Islamists and their apologists who argue for “religious toleration” are arrogantly dishonest. They ignore the fact that more than 100 mosques already exist in New York City . Meanwhile, there are no churches or synagogues in all of Saudi Arabia . In fact no Christian or Jew can even enter Mecca .
 And they lecture us about tolerance.
 If the people behind the Cordoba House were serious about religious toleration, they would be imploring the Saudis, as fellow Muslims, to immediately open up Mecca to all and immediately announce their intention to allow non-Muslim houses of worship in the Kingdom. They should be asked by the news media if they would be willing to lead such a campaign. 
 We have not been able to rebuild the World Trade Center in nine years. Now we are being told a 13 story, $100 million megamosque will be built within a year overlooking the site of the most devastating surprise attack in American history.   Finally where is the money coming from? The people behind the Cordoba House refuse to reveal all their funding sources.   America is experiencing an Islamist cultural-political offensive designed to undermine and destroy our civilization. Sadly, too many of our elites are the willing apologists for those who would destroy them if they could. 
 No mosque. No self deception. No surrender. The time to take a stand is now – at this site on this issue.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/luther-obama/	Photo of President Barack Obama and Son at 2012 Democratic Convention	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	"CHARLOTTE, NC — The first family has turned more than a few heads at this week’s Democratic National Convention, where the president, as he greets delegates and waves to crowds of supporters, is often accompanied not only by his wife and two daughters, but also his rarely seen 19-year-old son, Luther.
The shy, slightly overweight teenager, who has lived his entire life with his mother in central Illinois, seldom appears in public with the president, with whom he has reportedly shared a somewhat distant and occasionally strained relationship.
“When I saw that kid with President Obama, I had no clue who he was,” said Georgia delegate Kathy Tyson, stating that the teen appeared to have difficulty sustaining eye contact with others and stood uncomfortably alongside his father when he shook hands with voters Thursday. “I guess he does kind of look like the president, though a bit shorter and stockier.”
Luther was born in 1993 to Andrea Pletcher, then a 24-year-old diner cashier whom Obama, a young law professor at the time, met during a brief trip to the state capital of Springfield. While the president’s son is said to have faced numerous obstacles during his childhood, including academic troubles, repeated emotional outbursts, and his mother’s bouts with alcoholism, family friends have stated that overall he was a “good kid” who “genuinely meant well.”
White House aides said the president sends money to Pletcher each month for Luther’s care. After he became a U.S. senator and moved to Washington, Obama reportedly visited his 11-year-old son every other Saturday afternoon, playing wiffle ball with him or taking him out to a movie matinee and then dinner at the local Applebee’s.
When he became president, however, Obama’s contact with the boy reduced markedly, though sources confirmed he would still send Luther a birthday card and speak with him on the phone every month or so, often talking him through his schoolwork or asking about his son’s interests in music and online gaming.
According to reports, the two have often struggled to find common ground, owing largely to their sharply differing levels of motivation and expectations for academic and personal success.
“There was a rough patch during Luther’s early and mid-teens when he and his dad didn’t get along at all,” said Pletcher, speaking from the $600-a-month ground-level condominium she shares with her son and live-in boyfriend. “But Barry came to Luther’s high school graduation last year, and that was a big step forward for them. And now that Luther’s rebellious phase seems to be winding down, there’s definitely a greater respect between them.”
“I’ll tell you, though, Luther was a real handful for a while there, with his ADD and all,” Pletcher continued. “But he’s doing okay now. And I’ve been with [boyfriend] Ian [Williams] for the past three years, so Luther’s had a male figure he can look up to a little bit.”
In a sign of their improving relationship, Obama is said to have congratulated his son heartily upon learning Luther was giving school another shot this fall, enrolling part-time at Lincoln Land Community College. Additionally, Obama expressed optimism that his son could have a “real bright future” in the field of sales or, if he applied himself, computers.
With Luther now slated to join the first family on the campaign trail, staffers confirmed the president has encouraged them to entrust the frequently expressionless teen, who often dresses in all-black clothing, with some minor tasks to help him learn about responsibility.
“We’ve got Luther stuffing envelopes and handing out pins to the delegates, and he’s doing a great job,” senior campaign aide Stephanie Cutter said. “It takes a while for him to come out of his shell, but once he opens up he’s a real nice kid. Plus he’s just so great with Sasha and Malia. They really love their half-brother.”
“Luther may not have his father’s smarts or gift for rhetoric,” Cutter added, “but he tries. And he’s got a good heart—a real good heart.”
Despite comments that interactions between the president and his son have remained noticeably stiff and awkward, Obama said he was excited that he and Luther were spending quality time together and “finally starting to get to know each other.”
“I can’t say I was the perfect father by any means,” said Obama, admitting candidly that he “wasn’t always there for Luther.” “While my son has battled his share of problems, his mother really did the best she could raising him, and I think she did a fine job. Now Luther and I are ready to move forward and make up for lost time.” “I’m real proud of my boy,” he added, putting his arm around his son, who flinched ever so slightly at the physical contact.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/norris-obama-letter/	“Obama, Now That You Work For Me”	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Obama, Now That You Work for Me (A Letter to the President-Elect)
By Chuck Norris
11/11/2008
Dear President-elect Obama:

First, congratulations on your victory. The historical magnitude of your presidential win is nothing short of stupendous and a colossal fulfillment of the American dream (an achievement embedded long ago in the equality clauses of the Declaration of Independence).
It’s likely no big surprise that I don’t see eye to eye with you politically. Actually, I stand in stark opposition to most of your politics. Still, I realize that we must learn to work together if we are to see our country get back on track. After Election Day, I asked myself, “How can I work for our new president to help better America ?”   Then a thought occurred to me. The first question that should be answered is: How will you work for me? After all, “We the People” of the United States employ you, correct?

So here are a few ways
You might begin to gain the respect of those who oppose you and to show that your campaign pledges to bridge the divides were not empty promises to get you into office. And these requests I make are based upon the inaugural oath you will make Jan. 20, “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” No doubt these won’t be my only requests through the years, but they serve as a good beginning:
Use and cite the Constitution. If that constitutional oath (“preserve, protect and defend”) is the central duty of your job description, then I assume we will be hearing often from you about exactly how you are doing just that. There is no replacement for strict adherence, application and defense of the Constitution. And it’s high time that presidents quit reciting the presidential oath tritely and then abandoning its tenets when they enter the Oval Office. You should be quoting from the Constitution publicly as often as a preacher quotes the Bible to his congregation — at least weekly. If you take this oath and challenge seriously, you will limit the powers of federal government, reduce taxes (for everyone), encourage the freedom of religion and expression (even in the public square), and stand up for such things as our right to bear arms. The American public and the government have lost their grip on the content and role of the Constitution, but if you daily choose, you can help to re-educate and model its usage for them.
Protect American life. Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1809, “The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” Those are powerful and enlightening words. Of course, such a role was created and secured in the very fabric of our nation — in the Declaration of Independence.  The commitment to protect life should serve as the basis for all you do, even as a foundation for your national defense strategy. I’m sure the first of your secret briefings this past week on our global security threats have opened your eyes to the extensive onslaught of our enemies. Don’t allow your pride, partisanship, personal bias or political abilities to jeopardize the safety of Americans lives. As commander in chief, you are called to preserve American life. Quite frankly, that is why I’m surprised that a man such as you, who professes to fight for minorities, would not recognize the clear value of a human life in a womb. Federal law should not decree the sacrifice of one human life for the preference of another. Both lives should be protected. Otherwise, what do Jefferson ‘s 1809 words mean? As president, you are called to protect (not destroy) human life; it is the “first and only legitimate object of good government.”
Lead more from the center. It’s been pointed out by countless pundits, and your track record is clear: You have one of the most liberal records in the Senate. You’ve had the liberty of voting and fighting for an agenda “from the left” as you’ve tried to persuade state and federal lawmakers to do the same. But if you continue to lead our country down a more liberal road, you will follow the peril of Bill Clinton, who stepped into office and initially tried to lift the ban on gays in the military and extend abortion rights, only to prompt the creation of a more balanced and strong Republican Congress in the 1990s. Don’t underestimate the resurrecting power of the conservative voice. You observed in last week’s election how three states across this union voted to protect marriage in their constitutions (the 28th, 29th and 30th states to do so — California , Arizona and Florida).
We will be watching who you choose to be in your Cabinet. We will discern how you lead Pelosi and Reid. We will be observing those you select as candidates for Supreme Court justices. The election is over.  No more promises. No more words. You might work well in a team, but this time, you don’t have congressional members to hide behind. You’re on your own — leading the pack — and the whole country is watching.

I, especially, am watching.
So make sure you lead more from the center.
One of your 300 million bosses,
Chuck Norris

https://www.truthorfiction.com/joseph-olson/	Law Professor points out some interesting facts concerning thePresidential election	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
Interesting Statistics Professor Joseph Olson of Hemline University School of Law, St. Paul , Minnesota , points out some interesting facts concerning the Presidential election:
 
 
 Number of States won by: Democrats: 19 Republicans: 29 Square miles of land won by: Democrats: 580,000 Republicans: 2,427,000 Population of counties won by: Democrats: 127 million Republicans: 143 million Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by: Democrats: 13.2 Republicans: 2.1 
Professor Olson adds: “In aggregate, the map of the territory Republican won by Republicans was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of the country.  Democrat territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in government-owned tenements and living off various forms of government welfare.
 Professor Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the”complacency and apathy” phase of Professor Tyler’s definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nation’s population already having reached the “governmental dependency” phase. 
If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty million criminal invaders called illegal’s and they vote, then we can say goodbye to the USA in fewer than five years 
Pass this along to help everyone realize just how much is at stake, knowing that apathy is the greatest danger to our freedom.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/missouri-illegal-aliens/	A viral email and social media posting alleges that Missouri has no unauthorized immigrants because state lawmakers have passed a number of bills aimed at cracking down on them.	Not True	['immigration', 'missouri', 'undocumented workers']			2015/03/17	" SMARTEST LAWMAKERS ARE IN MISSOURI!  “Smartest State in the USA”???  
Missouri has no illegals, go figure…shouldn’t the other states do the same? Missouri ‘s approach to the problem of illegal immigration appears to be more advanced, sophisticated, strict and effective than anything to date in Arizona . Does the White House appreciate what Missouri has done? So, why doesn’t Missouri receive attention? Answer: There are no illegals in Missouri to demonstrate. The “Show Me” state has again shown us how it should be done. There needs to be more publicity and exposure regarding what Missouri has done. Please pass this around. In 2007, Missouri placed on the ballot a proposed constitutional amendment designating English as the official language of Missouri . In November, 2008, nearly 90% voted in favor! Thus, English became the official language for ALL governmental activity in Missouri . No individual has the right to demand government services in a language OTHER than English. In 2008, a measure was passed that required the Missouri Highway Patrol and other law enforcement officials to verify the immigration status of any person arrested, and inform federal authorities if the person is found to be in Missouri illegally. Missouri law enforcement officers receive specific training with respect to enforcement of federal immigration laws. In Missouri , illegal immigrants do NOT have access to taxpayer benefits such as food stamps or health care through Missouri Health NET.
In 2009, a measure was passed that ensures Missouri ‘s public institutions of higher education do NOT award financial aid to individuals who are illegally in the United States.
In Missouri , all post-secondary institutions of higher education to annually certify to the Missouri Dept. Of Higher Education that they have NOT knowingly awarded financial aid to students who are unlawfully present in the United States .
So, while Arizona has made national news for its new law,it is important to remember, Missouri has been far more proactive in addressing this horrific problem. Missouri has made it clear that illegal immigrants are NOT welcome in the state and they will certainly NOT receive public benefits at the expense of Missouri taxpayers.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-executive-orders-number/	923 Executive Orders Enacted by President Obama	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
EXECUTIVE ORDERS ISSUED… Teddy Roosevelt 3 Others to FDR NONE FDR 11 in 16 years Truman 5 in 7 years Ike 2 in 8 years Kennedy 4 in 3 years LBJ 4 in 5 years Nixon 1 in 6 years Ford 3 in 2 years Carter 3 in 4 years Reagan 5 in 8 years Bush 3 in 4 years Clinton 15 in 8 years George W. Bush 62 in 8 years Obama 923 in 3 1/2 years!

Subject: Executive Orders …. where’s the media?
 If you don’t get the implications, you’re not paying attention. How many warnings do you need?
923 Executive Orders in 40 Months 
During my lifetime, all Presidents have issued Executive Orders, for reasons that vary, some more than others. 
When a President issued as many as 30 Ex. Orders during a term in office, people thought there was something amiss.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT 923 EX. ORDERS IN ONE PART OF ONE TERM? YES, THERE IS A REASON. IT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. 
Even some Democrats in the House have turned on him, plus a very small number of Democrat Senators question him. 
HE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. WHAT IS HE REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH??? 
DOES THIS SCARE YOU AS MUCH AS IT DOES ME? ________________________________ 
Not really surprising that he appointed “Czars” to be in charge of everything. Emperor Obama? Coming soon to a neighborhood near you. 
THIS IS NOT FUNNY, AND IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN, YOU CAN EXPECT MORE! 
Remember what he told Russia ‘s Putin: “I’ll be more flexible after I’m re-elected”. 
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: Obama has signed 923 Executive Orders in 40 months! What did Congress do in those 40 months? (The House – considerable. The Senate -nothing, not even a budget nor allowing any House bill to be considered.) A whole new order must prevail in Wash. DC as a result of this next election! Now look at these: 
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports. -EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.

Feel free to verify the “executive orders” at will… and these are just the major ones I’m sure you’ve all heard the tale of the “Frog in the Pot”… you all comfortable??? Watch Obama’s actions, not his words! By his actions he will show you where America is headed. 
. Just this week, Obama has issued a new executive order that seeks to “harmonize” U.S. economic regulations with the rest of the world. This new executive order is yet another incremental step that is pushing us closer to a North American Union and a one world economic system. 
Unfortunately, most Americans have absolutely no idea what is happening. The American people need to understand that Barack Obama is constantly looking for ways to integrate the United States more deeply with the rest of the world. The globalization of the world economy has accelerated under Obama, and this latest executive order represents a fundamental change in U.S. economic policy. Now federal regulators will be required to “harmonize” their work with the international community. 
THIS IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE?? THEN PROVE TO YOURSELF IT’S WRONG. Just Google it!

Subject: Fw: America’s Most Biblically-Hostile U.S. President 




America’s Most Biblically-Hostile U. S. President
 When one observes President Obama’s unwillingness to accommodate America’s four-century long religious conscience protection through his attempts to require Catholics to go against their own doctrines and beliefs, one is tempted to say that he is anti-Catholic. But that characterization would not be correct. Although he has recently singled out Catholics, he has equally targeted traditional Protestant beliefs over the past four years. So since he has attacked Catholics and Protestants, one is tempted to say that he is anti-Christian. But that, too, would be inaccurate. He has been equally disrespectful in his appalling treatment of religious Jews in general and Israel in particular. So perhaps the most accurate description of his antipathy toward Catholics, Protestants, religious Jews, and the Jewish nation would be to characterize him as anti-Biblical. And then when his hostility toward Biblical people of faith is contrasted with his preferential treatment of Muslims and Muslim nations, it further strengthens the accuracy of the anti-Biblical descriptor. In fact, there have been numerous clearly documented times when his pro-Islam positions have been the cause of his anti-Biblical actions.  Listed below in chronological order are (1) numerous records of his attacks on Biblical persons or organizations; (2) examples of the hostility toward Biblical faith that have become evident in the past three years in the Obama-led military; (3) a listing of his open attacks on Biblical values; and finally (4) a listing of numerous incidents of his preferential deference for Islam’s activities and positions, including letting his Islamic advisors guide and influence his hostility toward people of Biblical faith. 1. Acts of hostility toward people of Biblical faith: 
April 2008 – Obama speaks disrespectfully of Christians, saying they “cling to guns or religion” and have an “antipathy to people who aren’t like them.” 1 February 2009 – Obama announces plans to revoke conscience protection for health workers who refuse to participate in medical activities that go against their beliefs, and fully implements the plan in February 2011. 2  April 2009 – When speaking at Georgetown University, Obama orders that a monogram symbolizing Jesus’ name be covered when he is making his speech. 3  May 2009 – Obama declines to host services for the National Prayer Day (a day established by federal law) at the White House. 4  April 2009 – In a deliberate act of disrespect, Obama nominated three pro-abortion ambassadors to the Vatican; of course, the pro-life Vatican rejected all three. 5  October 19, 2010 – Obama begins deliberately omitting the phrase about “the Creator” when quoting the Declaration of Independence – an omission he has made on no less than seven occasions. 6  November 2010 – Obama misquotes the National Motto, saying it is “E pluribus unum” rather than “In God We Trust” as established by federal law. 7  January 2011 – After a federal law was passed to transfer a WWI Memorial in the Mojave Desert to private ownership, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that the cross in the memorial could continue to stand, but the Obama administration refused to allow the land to be transferred as required by law, and refused to allow the cross to be re-erected as ordered by the Court. 8  February 2011 – Although he filled posts in the State Department, for more than two years Obama did not fill the post of religious freedom ambassador, an official that works against religious persecution across the world; he filled it only after heavy pressure from the public and from Congress. 9  April 2011 – For the first time in American history, Obama urges passage of a non-discrimination law that does not contain hiring protections for religious groups, forcing religious organizations to hire according to federal mandates without regard to the dictates of their own faith, thus eliminating conscience protection in hiring. 10  August 2011 – The Obama administration releases its new health care rules that override religious conscience protections for medical workers in the areas of abortion and contraception. 11  November 2011 – Obama opposes inclusion of President Franklin Roosevelt’s famous D-Day Prayer in the WWII Memorial. 12  November 2011 – Unlike previous presidents, Obama studiously avoids any religious references in his Thanksgiving speech. 13  December 2011 – The Obama administration denigrates other countries’ religious beliefs as an obstacle to radical homosexual rights. 14  January 2012 – The Obama administration argues that the First Amendment provides no protection for churches and synagogues in hiring their pastors and rabbis. 15  February 2012 – The Obama administration forgives student loans in exchange for public service, but announces it will no longer forgive student loans if the public service is related to religion. 16 2. Acts of hostility from the Obama-led military toward people of Biblical faith: 
June 2011 – The Department of Veterans Affairs forbids references to God and Jesus during burial ceremonies at Houston National Cemetery. 17  August 2011 – The Air Force stops teaching the Just War theory to officers in California because the course is taught by chaplains and is based on a philosophy introduced by St. Augustine in the third century AD – a theory long taught by civilized nations across the world (except America). 18  September 2011 – Air Force Chief of Staff prohibits commanders from notifying airmen of programs and services available to them from chaplains. 19  September 2011 – The Army issues guidelines for Walter Reed Medical Center stipulating that “No religious items (i.e. Bibles, reading materials and/or facts) are allowed to be given away or used during a visit.” 20 November 2011 – The Air Force Academy rescinds support for Operation Christmas Child, a program to send holiday gifts to impoverished children across the world, because the program is run by a Christian charity. 21 November 2011 – The Air Force Academy pays $80,000 to add a Stonehenge-like worship center for pagans, druids, witches and Wiccans. 22 February 2012 – The U. S. Military Academy at West Point disinvites three star Army general and decorated war hero Lieutenant General William G. (“Jerry”) Boykin (retired) from speaking at an event because he is an outspoken Christian. 23 February 2012 – The Air Force removes “God” from the patch of Rapid Capabilities Office (the word on the patch was in Latin: Dei). 24 February 2012 – The Army orders Catholic chaplains not to read a letter to parishioners that their archbishop asked them to read. 25 3. Acts of hostility toward Biblical values: 
January 2009 – Obama lifts restrictions on U.S. government funding for groups that provide abortion services or counseling abroad, forcing taxpayers to fund pro-abortion groups that either promote or perform abortions in other nations. 26 January 2009 – President Obama’s nominee for deputy secretary of state asserts that American taxpayers are required to pay for abortions and that limits on abortion funding are unconstitutional. 27 March 2009 – The Obama administration shut out pro-life groups from attending a White House-sponsored hea
lth care summit. 28 March 2009 – Obama orders taxpayer funding of embryonic stem cell research. 29 March 2009 – Obama gave $50 million for the UNFPA, the UN population agency that promotes abortion and works closely with Chinese population control officials who use forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations. 30 May 2009 – The White House budget eliminates all funding for abstinence-only education and replaces it with “comprehensive” sexual education, repeatedly proven to increase teen pregnancies and abortions. 31 He continues the deletion in subsequent budgets. 32 May 2009 – Obama officials assemble a terrorism dictionary calling pro-life advocates violent and charging that they use racism in their “criminal” activities. 33 July 2009 – The Obama administration illegally extends federal benefits to same-sex partners of Foreign Service and Executive Branch employees, in direction violation of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. 34 September 16, 2009 – The Obama administration appoints as EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum, who asserts that society should “not tolerate” any “private beliefs,” including religious beliefs, if they may negatively affect homosexual “equality.” 35 July 2010 – The Obama administration uses federal funds in violation of federal law to get Kenya to change its constitution to include abortion. 36 August 2010 – The Obama administration Cuts funding for 176 abstinence education programs. 37 September 2010 – The Obama administration tells researchers to ignore a judge’s decision striking down federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. 38 February 2011 – Obama directs the Justice Department to stop defending the federal Defense of Marriage Act. 39 March 2011 – The Obama administration refuses to investigate videos showing Planned Parenthood helping alleged sex traffickers get abortions for victimized underage girls. 40 July 2011 – Obama allows homosexuals to serve openly in the military, reversing a policy originally instituted by George Washington in March 1778. 41 September 2011 – The Pentagon directs that military chaplains may perform same-sex marriages at military facilities in violation of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. 42 October 2011 – The Obama administration eliminates federal grants to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for their extensive programs that aid victims of human trafficking because the Catholic Church is anti-abortion. 43 4. Acts of preferentialism for Islam: 
May 2009 – While Obama does not host any National Day of Prayer event at the White House, he does host White House Iftar dinners in honor of Ramadan. 44 April 2010 – Christian leader Franklin Graham is disinvited from the Pentagon’s National Day of Prayer Event because of complaints from the Muslim community. 45 April 2010 – The Obama administration requires rewriting of government documents and a change in administration vocabulary to remove terms that are deemed offensive to Muslims, including jihad, jihadists, terrorists, radical Islamic, etc. 46 August 2010 – Obama speaks with great praise of Islam and condescendingly of Christianity. 47 August 2010 – Obama went to great lengths to speak out on multiple occasions on behalf of building an Islamic mosque at Ground Zero, while at the same time he was silent about a Christian church being denied permission to rebuild at that location. 48 2010 – While every White House traditionally issues hundreds of official proclamations and statements on numerous occasions, this White House avoids traditional Biblical holidays and events but regularly recognizes major Muslim holidays, as evidenced by its 2010 statements on Ramadan, Eid-ul-Fitr, Hajj, and Eid-ul-Adha. 49 October 2011 – Obama’s Muslim advisers block Middle Eastern Christians’ access to the White House. 50 February 2012 – The Obama administration makes effulgent apologies for Korans being burned by the U. S. military, 51 but when Bibles were burned by the military, numerous reasons were offered why it was the right thing to do. 52 Many of these actions are literally unprecedented – this is the first time they have happened in four centuries of American history. The hostility of President Obama toward Biblical faith and values is without equal from any previous American president.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-gift-to-syria/	Obama Gives Syrians $195,000,000 for Muslim Holiday	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Obama Gives Muslim Nation $195,000,000 For Muslim Holiday
It’s the Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan. President Obama has decided to give $195M of taxpayer money to the Islamic nation of Syria to mark the occasion.
In an official White House release, President Obama said: “Michelle and I send our warmest greetings to Muslims celebrating Eid al-Fitr here in the United States and around the world. During the past month, Muslims have honored their faith through prayer and service, fasting and time spent with loved ones.”
Then, he gets to the best part of any holiday celebration…the gifts!
“To help the many Syrians in need this Eid al-Fitr, the United States is providing an additional $195 million in food aid and other humanitarian aid, bringing our humanitarian contribution to the Syrian people to over $1 billion since the crisis began.”
Meanwhile, the sequester continues, the White House is not conducting educational tours, and our military don’t have the necessary equipment to protect themselves.
Is this a time to celebrate with a war-torn Muslim country, or a time to be fiscally responsible?

Date: 2/25/2011
As a constitutional lawyer with nearly three decades of experience arguing cases before our nation’s highest courts, I believe President Barack Obama has pushed our nation to the brink of a constitutional crisis!
Consider what has happened in the last 60 days…
The Obama Administration’s five-member Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seized the Internet while courts and two commissioners have said they do not have the constitutional authority to do so. 
Without a vote in Congress, Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented draconian “global warming” controls over greenhouse gases, which many legal experts say are unconstitutional.
The President refuses to back down on fully implementing ObamaCare despite two federal judges’ rulings that the entire healthcare “reform” structure is unconstitutional.
Now, a move is under way to give Obama a “kill switch” of ultimate control over the Internet under the guise of national security! If you wonder what that might look like, it just transpired in Egypt where the government literally shut down the Internet to stifle all opposition.
There is a distinct pattern to the Obama Administration’s attacks on the constitutionally prescribed checks and balances at the heart of our form of government.
The Obama plan is to increase the power and authority of his administration at the expense of Congress, the courts, and citizens like you and me.
++We must “Uphold the Constitution”!
That’s why Liberty Counsel is launching a nationwide grassroots campaign to rally hundreds of thousands of citizens to stand together and demand that every federal official “Uphold the Constitution”… Including our President, Barack Obama!
This is the single most important issue we face in America today and I need you to stand with me! Go here to join others in demanding that President Obama, Congress, and every elected official, “Uphold the Constitution”:

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-birth/	Hawaii Was Not a State When Obama was Born There and his Mother Was NotEligible to Give Birth to a U.S. Citizen	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
 Version #1
Barack Obama is not legally a U.S. Natural-born citizen according to the law on the books at the time of his birth, which falls between “December 24, 1952 to November 13, 1986? .  
Presidential office requires a natural-born citizen if the child was not born to two U.S. Citizen parents, which of course is what exempts John McCain though he was born in the Panama Canal.  
US Law very clearly stipulates: “…If only one parent was a U.S. Citizen at the time of your birth, that parent must have resided in the United States for at least ten years, at least five of which had to be after the age of 16.” 
Barack Obama’s father was not a U.S. Citizen and Obama’s mother was only 18 when Obama was born, which means though she had been a U.S. Citizen for 10 years, (or citizen perhaps because of Hawai’i being a territory) the mother fails the test for being so for at least 5 years **prior to** Barack Obama’s birth, but *after* age 16. 
It doesn’t matter *after* . 
In essence, she was not old enough to qualify her son for automatic U.S. Citizenship. 
At most, there were only 2 years elapsed since his mother turned 16 at the time of Barack Obama’s birth when she was 18 in Hawai’i. 
His mother would have needed to have been 16+5= 21 years old, at the time of Barack Obama’s birth for him to have been a natural-born citizen. 
As aformentioned, she was a young college student at the time and was not. Barack Obama was already 3 years old at that time his mother would have needed to have waited to have him as the only U.S. Cizen parent. 
Obama instead should have been naturalized, but even then, that would still disqualify him from holding the office. 
*** Naturalized citizens are ineligible to hold the office of President. *** 
Though Barack Obama was sent back to Hawaii at age 10, all the other info does not matter because his mother is the one who needed to have been a U.S. Citzen for 10 years prior to his birth on August 4, 1961, with 5 of those years being after age 16. 
Further, Obama may have had to have remained in the country for some time to protect any citizenship he would have had, rather than living in Indonesia. 
Now you can see why Obama’s aides stopped his speech about how we technically have more than 50 states, because it would have led to this discovery. 
This is very clear cut and a blaring violation of U.S. Election law. 
I think the Gov. Of California would be very insterested in knowing this if Obama were elected President without being a natural-born U.S. Citizen, and it would set precedence. 
Stay tuned to your TV sets because I suspect some of this information will be leaking through over the next several days…

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-gun-control/	Illinois State Rifle Association Commentary	Truth but an Opinion!				2015/03/17	" Below is an open letter from the Illinois State Rifle Association’s chief lobbyist, please read!  
Illinois State Rifle Association 
420 E. Locust, P.O. Box 637, Chatsworth, IL 60921 
Phone: (815) 635-3198 or (815) 635-3166 Fax: (815) 635-3723 Website: www.isra.org 
Fellow Sportsman: 
Over the past 15 years, I have served in the Illinois state capitol as the chief lobbyist for the Illinois State Rifle  
Association. 
I lobbied Barack Obama extensively while he was an Illinois State Senator. As a result of that 
experience, I know Obama’s attitudes toward guns and gun owners better than anyone. The truth be 
told, in all my years in the Capitol I have never met a legislator who harbors more contempt for 
the law-abiding firearm owner than Barack Obama. 
Although Obama claims to be an advocate for the 2 nd Amendment, his voting 
record in the Illinois Senate paints a very different picture. While a state senator, Obama voted 
for a bill that would ban nearly every hunting rifle, shotgun and target rifle owned by Illinois citizens. 
That same bill would authorize the state police to raid homes of gun owners and forcibly confiscate 
banned guns. Obama supported a bill that would shut down law-abiding firearm manufacturers 
including Springfield Armory, Armalite, Rock River Arms and Les Baer. Obama also voted for a bill 
that would prohibit law-abiding citizens from purchasing more than one gun per month. 
Without a doubt, Barack Obama has proven himself to be an enemy of the law abiding firearm owner. At 
the same time, Obama has proven himself to be a friend to the hardened criminal. While a state senator, 
Obama voted 4 times against legislation that would allow a homeowner to use a firearm in defense of 
home and family. 
Does Barack Obama still sound to you like a “friend” of the law-abiding gun owner? 
And speaking of friends, you can always tell a person by the company they keep. Obama counts 
among his friends the Rev. Michael Pfleger – a renegade Chicago priest who has openly called for the 
murder of gun shop owners and pro-gun legislators. Then there is his buddy Richard Daley, the mayor 
of Chicago who has declared that if it were up to him, nobody would be allowed to own a gun. And let’s 
not forget Obama’s pal George Soros – the guy who has pumped millions of dollars into the UN’s 
international effort to disarm law-abiding citizens. 
Obama has shown that he is more than willing to use other people’s money to fund his campaign to 
take your guns away from you. While a board member of the leftist Joyce Foundation, Barack Obama wrote 
checks for tens of millions of dollars to extremist gun control organizations such as the Illinois 
Council Against Handgun Violence and the Violence Policy Center. 
Does Barack Obama still sound to you like a “friend” of the law-abiding gun owner? 
By now, I’m sure that many of you have received mailings from an organization called 
“American Hunters and Shooters Association(AHSA)” talking about what a swell fellow Obama is and 
how he honors the 2 Amendment and how you will never have to worry about Obama coming to take 
your guns. Let me make it perfectly clear – everything the AHSA says about Obama is pure hogwash. 
The AHSA is headed by a group of left-wing elitists who subscribe to the British view of hunting and shooting. 
That is, a state of affairs where hunting and shooting are reserved for the wealthy upper-crust who can afford 
guided hunts on exclusive private reserves.  
The AHSA is not your friend, never will be.  
In closing, I’d like to remind you that I’m a guy who has actually gone nose to nose with Obama on gun rights 
issues. The Obama I know cannot even begin to identify with this nation’s outdoor traditions. The Obama I 
know sees you, the law abiding gun owner, as nothing but a low-class lummox who is easily swayed by the 
flash of a smile and a ration of rosy rhetoric. The Obama I know is a stony-faced liar who has honed 
his skill at getting what he wants – so long as people are willing to give it to him. 
That’s the Barack Obama I know.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-ring-watch-muslim/	President’s Lack Of Jewelry During Ramadan is a Sign That He Must Be a Muslim	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Wedding ring is in for repair
Since when does a plain wedding band need repairs, along with your watch, for a whole month?
Another piece falls into place. In a press conference last week Obama was not wearing his wedding ring nor was he wearing his watch.
When noticed, his staff said his ring was out for repairs. No reason was given for the missing watch.
So it’s just a coincidence that Muslims are forbidden from wearing jewelry during the month of Ramadan Can’t possibly be that, because although he hasn’t gone to a Christian church service since entering the White House, we know he’s a committed Christian “cause he said so during his campaign!” ………..And I’ve got a bridge to nowhere to sell you also.
This is the same president that spent the Christmas holidays in Hawaii to avoid religious obligations as PRESIDENT at the White House. His children do not receive Christmas presents.
Let’s just face the facts and quit trying to distort the truth, we have a Muslim for president in the White House, and he has no knowledge of American history.
Hey guys, we’re not paying attention, Muslims will soon rule the world. Put God first in your life and above all others. Regardless of who they are!
Please pass this on to believers of what is happening to our Great Nation and to those who are still in denial!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-heading-for-divorce/	Michelle Walks Out As Obama Divorce Battle Explodes	 Pending Investigation!				2015/03/17	"National Enquirer: MICHELLE WALKS OUT AS OBAMA DIVORCE BATTLE EXPLODES!
IN a major behind-the-scenes blowout, President BARACK OBAMA and first lady MICHELLE waged their worst White House fight ever over her lavish vacation trip to China!
Sources tell The ENQUIRER that Obama exploded when Mi­chelle refused to cancel her pricey getaway – even after White House advisers warned him that the first couple’s six-year string of extravagant vacations had already drained the U.S. Trea­sury of a whopping $150 million in tax­payers’ money.
Instead of postpon­ing her trip, a furious Michelle – still seeth­ing over the embarrassing “selfie” Barack recently snapped with a leggy blonde head of state – announced that she was taking her mother along for company.
She further declared that she didn’t want reporters covering her activities overseas.
“This was a blowout of epic proportions – probably the nasti­est White House fight they’ve ever had,” a Washington, D.C., insider told The ENQUIRER.
“They were both screaming at one another.
“The president was infuriated when advisers told him that they’d added up the costs of all their ‘vacations’ and China was putting them over the $150 million mark.
“But he’s defenseless to stop Michelle be­cause their marriage has collapsed. She’s doing what she wants – and that’s seeing the world on the American taxpayers’ dime.”
The embattled commander in chief flat-out begged his wife of 21 years to postpone the trip, according to a family insider.
“But she refused,” said the source.
“Then, when Barack asked why she had to take her mother along, Mi­chelle ripped into him. She screamed that he was ‘lucky’ that she hadn’t left him after that embarrassing ‘selfie,’ and then she stormed off.”
Michelle arrived in Beijing with her mother, Marian Robinson, and the Obamas’ daughters, 15-year-old Malia and Sasha, 12, on March 20 for a planned seven-day, three-city trip.
They checked into the lavish presidential suite at the Beijing Wes­tin hotel, costing a whopping $8,350 per night. The 3,400-square-foot suite included 24-hour butler service and a steam room.
One published report quoted hotel employees grumbling about Michelle’s mom “barking at the staff ” and added that the first lady’s party was “inconveniencing pretty much everyone.”
And it quickly became clear that Michelle had apparently won the battle to avoid media scrutiny.
While she was scheduled to de­liver a speech to students at Peking University, “The Weekly Standard” reported that “she won’t be accompa­nied by the press” because “she does not plan to give interviews.”
As a result, the White House went into spin control, noted the D.C. insider.
“They’re defending Michelle’s trip by calling it ‘a people-to-people exchange’ and emphasizing ‘the im­portance that both nations place on education,’” said the source. “But the fact is Michelle specifically demanded that reporters not follow her every move.”
Media were granted access to only two of the 22 events on the first lady’s schedule, and sources say Michelle’s media ban hid her secret agenda to split from the president.
Besides being humiliated by the president’s “selfie” photo with the sexy Danish prime minister at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service last December, sources say Michelle was further outraged when she learned the Secret Service had been covering up the president’s cheating.
The first lady has already met with divorce lawyers and is planning a separate life after her husband leaves the White House.
“Obama’s advisers told him he must try and keep Michelle ‘under control’ until then,” divulged the D.C. insider.
“They explained that if Michelle walked out while he was still in office, the impact on his presiden­tial legacy would be catastrophic.”
And Michelle isn’t doing him any favors by traveling like a queen.
Besides the family’s annual Au­gust vacation on ritzy Martha’s Vineyard and Christmas holiday in Hawaii, Michelle jetted off to Mexico and Spain in 2010, and kicked up her heels at a posh ski resort in Vail, Colo., in 2011.
In March 2011, she spent five days in Latin America with her mother and daughters. Three months later, they were joined by Michelle’s niece and nephew for a safari in South Africa.
In June 2013, the first lady spent two days in Ireland. That trip re­quired booking 30 rooms at an exclusive hotel for her staff and security detail, costing taxpayers a reported $5 million.
According to one published re­port: “The president’s pricey travels have become so controversial that ‘Judicial Watch’ was forced to sue the Secret Service and Defense De­partment to get them to turn over records on the amount of taxpayer money used to fly the first family all over the world…”
But Michelle couldn’t care less, said the D.C. insider.
“It’s clear to everyone at the White House that Barack has completely lost control of his wife,” said the source.
“Michelle does whatever she wants and goes wherever she wants. It’s as if she’s tacked up a map of the world and put pins on all the places she wants to visit. The sad part is that taxpayers are paying for her bucket list.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-nasa-speech/	President Obama's Visit and Speech at Cape Canaveral  Was Closed toNASA Employees	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
President Obama visited NASA-KSC on 4/15/2010. Here are a few highlights from his trip: 
– He arrived at the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at approximately 1:30 PM.  – He was driven around KSC & CCAFS to see sites including Space X
 The President at Space X 
– His motorcade proceeded not far from the building where I work. There is no picture for this historic moment in my life because every building on the military instillation near his motorcade was put into complete lockdown. 
– The President then gave a 45 minute speech on his plans for NASA at the Operations and Control building. 1,000 employees were given paid leave to keep them out of the building the entire day. The O&C building was in lockdown from 7 AM to 7 PM including the surrounding parking lots. 
– The speech was given to persons who rec’d a White House invitation. 
– The President then flew out from the SLF around 3:45 PM. 
The President came to “talk to us” about the future of NASA, but NONE of “us” were at his speech. Nor were we able to even wave to him as he drove around. Even his supporters that I work with were livid that they could not even walk out of the building to view his motorcade at a distance. One even stormed off from the single window facing the road he traveled & stated that America is not free. 
I can understand the desire for safety for our President, but this was serious over-kill. The President was on a secure facility; surrounded by unarmed nerds w/federally investigated backgrounds. Many of the employees at NASA-KSC have been around since the beginning of the shuttle program. I can honestly say that I do not believe we would have been confined to our buildings or that entire buildings would have been shut down for an entire day if Bush had ever visited … or any other past President for that matter. We, as the media labeled us, truly were hostile territory for this President. 
The President’s speech did not tell us anything more than what we could have read in Florida Today. We will still lose 8,000 jobs at just KSC alone. He will “save” 2,000 jobs … not really. Tho, his logic is very similar to the health care bill. We will spend (i.e. lose) 8,000 ($1 trillion dollars) jobs in order to save 2,000 jobs ($100 billion) in the future. He is still cancelling Constellation. He is still relegating us to the back of the bus in the space industry. We still do not have a private industry that can send humans into space. We will give foreign countries millions to employ their citizens in order to send our astronauts into space. 
He has proclaimed that he is giving us a “new” direction much like JFK did when he proclaimed that America would go to the moon. Only, his new direction does not have us going to the moon or Mars or even the ISS! He wants us to find where the Easter bunny lives (i.e. Climate Change). This is not a direction for NASA. This is the destruction of America ’s lead in space. 
This President spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to come & tell us everything we already knew. He could have simply remained in D.C. & given the same worthless speech to save everyone time & money. Operations at KSC were shut down; some for the entire day. For what? Well, we did learn something. When this President is around the “intelligent workforce that America ’s space industry cannot afford to lose,” we will be locked down & prevented from seeing him. 
This narcissistic, communistic President has betrayed America over & over again. His reign of destruction will prove difficult to fix when he is voted out in 2012. Are you, America , up for the challenge?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-hesitated/	President Obama Hesitated to Give Order to Kill Osama Bin Laden	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Subject: FW: White House Insider: Obama Hesitated – Panetta Issued Order to Kill Osama Bin Laden
Very interesting info from White House Insider:
“What Valerie Jarrett, and the president, did not know is that Leon Panetta had already initiated a program that reported to him –and only him, involving a covert on the ground attack against the compound.”
Q: You stated that President Obama was “overruled” by military/intelligence officials regarding the decision to send in military specialists into the Osama Bin Laden compound. Was that accurate?
A: I was told – in these exact terms, “we overruled him.” (Obama) I have since followed up and received further details on exactly what that meant, as well as the specifics of how Leon Panetta worked around the president’s “persistent hesitation to act.” There appears NOT to have been an outright overruling of any specific position by President Obama, simply because there was no specific position from the president to do so. President Obama was, in this case, as in all others, working as an absentee president.
<http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-noI1-aqYy3U/TcA-06RzYnI/AAAAAAAAAMs/-VU1dnMf4Ts/s1600/war+room.jpg>

(Notice that Panetta is NOT in the room)
This update comes some 24 hours after our longtime Washington D.C. Insider first outlined shocking details of an Obama administration having been “overruled” by senior military and intelligence officials leading up to the successful attack against terrorist Osama Bin Laden. What follows is further clarification of Insider’s insights surrounding that event.
I was correct in stating there had been a push to invade the compound for several weeks if not months, primarily led by Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates, David Petraeus, and Jim Clapper. The primary opposition to this plan originated from Valerie Jarrett, and it was her opposition that was enough to create uncertainty within President Obama. Obama would meet with various components of the pro-invasion faction, almost always with Jarrett present, and then often fail to indicate his position. This situation continued for some time, though the division between Jarrett/Obama and the rest intensified more recently, most notably from Hillary Clinton. She was livid over the president’s failure to act, and her office began a campaign of anonymous leaks to the media indicating such. As for Jarrett, her concern rested on two primary fronts. One, that the military action could fail and harm the president’s already weakened standing with both the American public and the world. Second, that the attack would be viewed as an act of aggression against Muslims, and further destabilize conditions in the Middle East.
Q: What changed the president’s position and enabled the attack against Osama Bin Laden to proceed?
A: Nothing changed with the president’s opinion – he continued to avoid having one. Every time military and intelligence officials appeared to make progress in forming a position, Jarrett would intervene and the stalling would begin again. Hillary started the ball really rolling as far as pressuring Obama began, but it was Panetta and Petraeus who ultimately pushed Obama to finally act – sort of. Panetta was receiving significant reports from both his direct CIA sources, as well as Petraeus-originating Intel. Petraeus was threatening to act on his own via a bombing attack. Panetta reported back to the president that a bombing of the compound would result in successful killing of Osama Bin Laden, and little risk to American lives. Initially, as he had done before, the president indicated a willingness to act. But once again, Jarrett intervened, convincing the president that innocent Pakistani lives could be lost in such a bombing attack, and Obama would be left attempting to explain Panetta’s failed policy. Again Obama hesitated – this time openly delaying further meetings to discuss the issue with Panetta. A brief meeting was held at this time with other officials, including Secretary Gates and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but Gates, like Panetta, was unable to push the president to act. It was at this time that Gates indicated to certain Pentagon officials that he may resign earlier than originally indicated – he was that frustrated. Both Panetta and Clinton convinced him to stay on and see the operation through.
What happened from there is what was described by me as a “masterful manipulation” by Leon Panetta. Panetta indicated to Obama that leaks regarding knowledge of Osama Bin Laden’s location were certain to get out sooner rather than later, and action must be taken by the administration or the public backlash to the president’s inaction would be “…significant to the point of political debilitation.” It was at that time that Obama stated an on-ground campaign would be far more acceptable to him than a bombing raid. This was intended as a stalling tactic, and it had originated from Jarrett. Such a campaign would take both time, and present a far greater risk of failure. The president had been instructed by Jarrett to inform Mr., Panetta that he would have sole discretion to act against the Osama Bin Laden compound. Jarrett believed this would further delay Panetta from acting, as the responsibility for failure would then fall almost entirely on him. What Valerie Jarrett, and the president, did not know is that Leon Panetta had already initiated a program that reported to him –and only him, involving a covert on the ground attack against the compound. Basically, the whole damn operation was already ready to go – including the specific team support Intel necessary to engage the enemy within hours of being given notice. Panetta then made plans to proceed with an on-ground assault. This information reached either Hillary Clinton or Robert Gates first (likely via military contacts directly associated with the impending mission) who then informed the other. Those two then met with Panetta, who informed each of them he had been given the authority by the president to proceed with a mission if the opportunity presented itself. Both Gates and Clinton warned Panetta of the implications of that authority – namely he was possibly being made into a scapegoat. Panetta admitted that possibility, but felt the opportunity to get Bin Laden outweighed that risk. During that meeting, Hillary Clinton was first to pledge her full support for Panetta, indicating she would defend him if necessary. Similar support was then followed by Gates. The following day, and with Panetta’s permission, Clinton met in private with Bill Daley and urged him to get the president’s full and open approval of the Panetta plan. Daley agreed such approval would be of great benefit to the action, and instructed Clinton to delay proceeding until he had secured that approval. Daley contacted Clinton within hours of their meeting indicating Jarrett refused to allow the president to give that approval. Daley then informed Clinton that he too would fully support Panetta in his actions, even if it meant disclosing the president’s indecision to the American public should that action fail to produce a successful conclusion. Clinton took that message back to Panetta and the CIA director initiated the 48 hour engagement order. At this point, the President of the United States was not informed of the engagement order – it did not originate from him, and for several hours after the order had been given and the special ops forces were preparing for action into Pakistan from their position in Afghanistan, Daley successfully kept Obama and Jarrett insulated from that order.
This insulation ended at some point with an abort order that I believe originated from Valerie Jarrett’s office, and was then followed up by President Obama. This abort order was later explained as a delay due to weather conditions, but the actual conditions at that time would have been acceptable for the mission. A storm system had been in the area earlier, but was no longer an issue. Check the data yourself to confirm. Jarrett, having been caught off guard, was now scrambling to determine who had initiated the plan. She was furious, repeating the acronym “CoC” and saying it was not being followed. This is where Bill Daley intervened. The particulars of that intervention are not clear to me beyond knowing he did meet with Jarrett in his office and following that meeting, Valerie Jarrett was not seen in the West Wing for some time, and apparently no longer offered up any resistance to the Osama Bin Laden mission. What did follow from there was one or more brief meetings between Bill Daley, Hillary Clinton, a representative from Robert Gates’ office, a representative from Leon Panetta’s office, and a representative from Jim Clapper’s office. I have to assume that these meetings were in essence, detailing the move to proceed with the operation against the Osama Bin Laden compound. I have been told by more than one source that Leon Panetta was directing the operation with both his own CIA operatives, as well as direct contacts with military – both entities were reporting to Panetta only at this point, and not the President of the United States. There was not going to be another delay as had happened 24 hour earlier. The operation at this point, was in effect, unknown to President Barack Obama or Valerie Jarrett and it remained that way until AFTER it was already underway. President Obama was literally pulled from a golf outing and escorted back to the White House to be informed of the mission. Upon his arrival there was a briefing held which included Bill Daley, John Brennan, and a high ranking member of the military. When Obama emerged from the briefing, he was described as looking “very confused and uncertain.” The president was then placed in the “situation room” where several of the players in this event had already been watching the operation unfold. Another interesting tidbit regarding this is that the Vice President was already “up to speed” on the operation. A source indicated they believe Hillary Clinton had personally made certain the Vice President was made aware of that day’s events before the president was. The now famous photo released shows the particulars of that of that room and its occupants. What that photo does not communicate directly is that the military personnel present in that room during the operation unfolding, deferred to either Hillary Clinton or Robert Gates. The president’s role was minimal, including their acknowledging of his presence in the room.
At the conclusion of the mission, after it had been repeatedly confirmed a success, President Obama was once again briefed behind closed doors. The only ones who went in that room besides the president were Bill Daley. John Brennan, and a third individual whose identity remains unknown to me. When leaving this briefing, the president came out of it “…much more confident. Much more certain of himself.” He was also carrying papers in his hand that quite possibly was the address to the nation given later that evening on the Bin Laden mission. The president did not have those papers with him prior to that briefing. The president then returned to the war room, where by this time, Leon Panetta had personally arrived and was receiving congratulations from all who were present.
In my initial communication to you of these events I described what unfolded as a temporary Coup initiated by high ranking intelligence and military officials. I stand by that term. These figures worked around the uncertainty of President Obama and the repeated resistance of Valerie Jarrett. If they had not been willing to do so, I am certain Osama Bin Laden would still be alive today. There will be no punishment to those who acted outside the authority of the president’s office. The president cannot afford to admit such a fact. What will be most interesting from here is to now see what becomes of Valerie Jarrett. One source indicated she is threatening resignation. I find that unlikely given my strong belief she needs the protection afforded her by the Oval Office and its immense powers to delay and eventually terminate investigations back in Chicago, but we shall see.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-books/	Quotes From Barack Obama Books	Truth! & Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Subject: Obama and his thoughts from HIS BOOKS
 
I wouldn’t recommend purchasing his books, but checking them out from the public library
and verifying the quotes this is a dangerous individual that has not been truthful, evidently
with very much he has uttered in public. Particularly the last quote!
This guy wants to be our President and control our government. Pay close attention to the last comment!! Below are a few lines from Obama’s books ” his words:
From Dreams of My Father: “I ceased to advertise my mother’s race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.”
From Dreams of My Father: “I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother’s race.”
From Dreams of My Father: “There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.”
From Dreams of My Father: ; “It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.”
From Dreams of My Father: “I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn’t speak to my own. It was into my father’s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, Dubois and Mandela.”
From Audacity of Hope: “I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.”
 
 
Holy Cow ! He’s lost his mind, and so has anyone that votes for him ! Go be President of a Muslim country, then !
 
Other version:

“A Coil of Rage”
The character of any man is defined by how he treats his mother as
the years pass . . . need I say more about this person below other than
there is no character, no integrity, but there is a ton of attitude and arrogance that defines his shallow past and hollow future . . . I rest my case.
I bought and read “Audacity of Hope”. It was difficult to read considering his attitude toward us and everything American. Let me add a phrase he used to describe his attitude toward whites. He harbors a “COIL OF RAGE”. His words not mine.
THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT
Is anyone out there awake?
Everyone of voting age should read these two books: Don’t buy them,
just get them from the library.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-healings/	Healings at Barack Obama Rallies	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Obama heals hundreds
 AUSTIN — Ginny McCallum, 43, who has been confined to a wheelchair for much of her adult life, came to hear presidential candidate Barack Obama speak at the University of Texas. Afterward she found herself in a wheelchair access breezeway as Obama and his entourage exited the arena. The candidate spotted her, came over, grabbed her hand and pulled her up. She found herself standing for the first time in eleven years.  
“He smiled at me and said, ‘Yes, you can,’” she says. “I was so stunned I didn’t know what to do.” 
McCallum is among hundreds of people who say they have been healed by the Democratic candidate, in one of the most surprising and little-acknowledged aspects of his campaign. Reporters have shied away from the story, chalking it up to “Obama-mania” and people’s feelings of elation. 
“We don’t talk about it a lot, but yeah, it does happen,” says one staffer who says he has seen multiple people healed on a rope line. “We don’t know exactly how or why it’s happening, and the Senator won’t talk about it. He usually insists that people keep it quiet and just report it to their pastor or priest.” 
Greeting supporters after a rousing speech in Houston, Obama stepped into the dense crowd and spontaneously began touching people: a legally blind woman, a man deaf in one ear, a cancer sufferer and a lame man. 
“Yes, you can,” Obama said as he laid hands on afflicted bodies. 
The people’s reactions were so joyous as to be almost frightening. They jumped and shouted and wept. Before they could thank or embrace the candidate he was well down the rope line healing others. Their excitement was lost in the general din of the crowd. 
Aides acknowledge that the phenomenon is occurring with greater frequency. 
“His power goes beyond simple inspiration,” says one aide. “There is something developing here that I’m not sure any of us fully understands.” 
They say Obama has told them privately that his time has not yet come, so it would be inappropriate to talk about the healings right now. He says he will wait until the convention to speak publicly about the “special calling” he believes he has to lead the country. They do expect him to start alluding to “the providential nature of what is happening on the campaign trail” in an upcoming address, mostly because word is getting around. 
People have begun bringing relatives by the score to campaign events in hopes of a healing touch. 
“It’s not the speeches that are drawing people anymore, as good as they are,” says a senior staff member. “It’s people wanting to get better, and wanting their friends and relatives to get better. It’s the belief that there’s something more here.” •

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-2010-air-force-one-trip-count/	President Obama Flew on Air Force One 172 Times in 2010	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
This is from Mark Knoller of CBS. The pilots and crew of Air Force One are flying more hours than a rookie on a beer run. They are tired of it too, and are adding more crew to Air Force-1, – I know this for a fact because I’m one of the instructors that trains the crews. Our company (Atlas Air) has had the Air Force-1 and E-4 contract for over two years and I’ve been doing it for about 8 months now. 
Last year (2010) Obama flew in Air Force One 172 times, almost every other day. 
White House officials have been telling reporters in recent days that the Democrat doesn’t intend to hang around the White House quite so much in 2011. They explain he wants to get out more around the country because, as everyone knows, that midterm election shellacking on Nov. 2 had nothing to do with his health care bill, over-spending or other policies, and everything to do with Obama’s not adequately explaining himself to his countrymen and women. 
And with only 673 days remaining in Obama’s never ending presidential campaign, the incumbent’s travel pace will not likely slacken. 
At an Air Force-estimated cost of $181,757 per flight HOUR (not to mention the additional travel costs of Marine One, Secret Service, logistics and local police overtime), that’s a lot of frequent flier dollars going into Obama’s carbon footprint. 
We are privy to some of these numbers thanks to CBS’ Mark Knoller, a bearded national treasure trove of presidential stats. According to Knoller’s copious notes, during the last year, Obama made 65 domestic trips over 104 days, and six trips to eight countries over 22 days. Not counting six vacation trips over 32 days. 
He took 196 helicopter trips, signed 203 pieces of legislation and squeezed in 29 rounds of left-handed golf. 
Obama last year gave 491 speeches, remarks or statements. That’s more talking than goes on in some entire families, at least from fatherly mouths.. 
In fact, even including the 24 days of 2010 that we never saw Obama in public, his speaking works out to about one official utterance every 11 waking hours. Aides indicate the “Real Good Talker” believes we need more. 
(note: Additional text below is not part of the original commentary)
Related: Obama spends nearly half his presidency outside Washington , plans to travel more 
Related: Vacationer-in-Chief Spends $1.75 Million to Visit Hawaiian Chums Obama has spent over $100 million taxpayer dollars flying around in Air Force One, and probably another $100 million on his entourage. Obama is just another tin-pot dictator living lavishly at the expense of his subjects. 
And we seniors have to “tighten our belts” because we aren’t getting a COLA again this year… and none last year! 
THANKS TO ALL WHO HELPED PUT THIS GREEDY WINDBAG IN OFFICE!!   BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-ring-proof-muslim/	President Obama is Married to Allah Because the Ring he Wears on his Wedding Finger is Inscribed with the First Pillar of Islam	 Unproven!				2015/03/17	" 
Many people have asked “Why did Obama wear a wedding ring for 10 years, before he was actually married to Michelle? “
this is apparently the answer: Obama is married to Allah.
High resolution digital photography has now shown us that the ring he wore on his left hand at age 20 and to this day, is a Muslim ring that many Muslims wear that has the Arabic words inscribed on it: ” There is no God except Allah”.
Today, this same ring serves as his wedding ring to Michelle. Obama is still married to Allah.
As we always suspected and Obama denied, Obama is a Muslim. His pastor of 20 years, Jeremiah Wright, says he is no Christian and Reverend Wright should know.Half white, half black, half American, half foreigner, 100% Muslim. You have got to respect a good con man for being good at what he does.
NEW YORK – As a student at Harvard Law School, then-bachelor Barack Obama’s practice of wearing a gold band on his wedding-ring finger puzzled his colleagues.
Now, newly published photographs of Obama from the 1980s show that the ring Obama wore on his wedding-ring finger as an unmarried student is the same ring Michelle Robinson put on his finger at the couple’s wedding ceremony in 1992.
Moreover, according to Arabic-language and Islamic experts, the ring Obama has been wearing for more than 30 years is adorned with the first part of the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada: “There is no God except Allah.”

OBAMA: MUSLIMS BUILT ‘THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR NATION’

On Sunday, President Obama and First Lady Michelle released a statement thanking Muslim Americans for their many “achievements and contributions… to building the very fabric of our nation and strengthening the core of our democracy.”
The comments were made to mark the celebration of Eid-al-Fitr, a time of spiritual renewal for Muslims which comes at the end of the month-long fast of Ramadan. The Obamas said in their statement that Eid “celebrates the common values that unite us in our humanity” and “welcomed their commitment to giving back to their communities.” The International Business Times reports that during Eid, Muslims join in Islamic prayer, while saying “Allahu Akbar,” or “God is Great,” and feasting.
The statement further reads that the administration “wishes Muslims in the United States and around the world a blessed and joyous celebration.” The letter ended with salutation of “Eid Mubarak,” which roughly means “blessed celebration.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obamacare-guns/	Senate Amendment to Obamacare Protects Law Biding Gun Owners	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
 Looks like Obama should have read the “Obamacare” law before he signed it, OR he was so eager to get “Obamacare” that he didn’t care about the “gun owners” clause that was in it!  
So, Obama was either stupid for not reading the bill OR knew the clause was necessary to get his “Obamacare” passed, so that his ego could soar! 
Wednesday, it was discovered that hidden deep within the massive 2800-page bill called Obamacare, there is a Senate Amendment protecting the right to keep and bear arms 
It seems that in their haste to cram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D CA) and Barack Obama overlooked Senate amendment 3276, Sec. 2716, part c.  
According to that amendment, the government cannot collect “any information relating to the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition.” This means that the government CANNOT mandate firearm registration. No registration, no confiscation. Poor ol’ Joe Biden, he spent the last couple of weeks focusing on making a law requiring registration. Good thing is though, the amendment also states that not even an executive order can override the amendment 
CNN is now referring to it as “a gift to the nation’s powerful gun lobby.”And according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), that’s exactly right. He says he personally added the provision in order to keep the NRA from getting involved in the legislative fight over Obamacare, which was so ubiquitous in 2010. 
It looks like Harry Reid actually helped out firearm owners without even realizing it. Thanks Harry!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-cuba/	Cuban Flag at Obama Campaign Office	Truth!				2015/03/17	"  Improbable as it sounds, it’s true. Barack Obama, displaying the same “anything goes” standard of patriotism he showed when he ostentatiously refused to wear a U.S. flag in his lapel, now shows he’s got a whole different idea about patriotism. 
 One of Obama’s volunteer offices in Houston was caught operating under a huge flag of communist Cuba with Che Guevara’s face printed on it, according to images shown on Fox 
 News. Flak from bloggers ensued — followed, of course, by spin control. But rather than repudiate the image, Obama would only call it “inappropriate,” apparently without insisting it be taken down. That contrasts with his dismissal of his Senate colleagues who wear lapel flags as “hypocrites.” Some hypocrites. 
 The display of the Castroite flag with Che’s picture on it sends a particularly disturbing message about his campaign. Apparently, Obama tends to attract the kind of people who think of mass murderers like Che and Fidel as romantic revolutionaries. Those same people see Obama as a man with a messianic message. These are the voters he’ll be indebted to should he win higher office. 
 Worse yet, it signals that a U.S. commander in chief tolerates supporters with loyalties to nations other than the U.S., including those loyal to enemy states that spy on and seek to harm the U.S.
 It coincides uncomfortably with Obama’s call for no-strings-attached diplomatic relations with communist Cuba. He’s even offered to meet with the dictators of Cuba, sanctimoniously implying that other administrations had no good reason for not doing so.
 Obama’s naive idealism is based on a false understanding of history. Cuba is a nation that aimed Soviet missiles at us in 1962 and is likely to do the same if and when Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez gets advanced weapons from Russia or Iran. That’s not all:  • Also in 1962, Cuba attempted to launch the first 9/11-style attack on New York’s subways and department stores — with the mastermind behind that none other than Che Guevara himself.  • In 1982 it tried to get the USSR to launch nukes at the U.S. • In 1996, Cuba shot down two U.S. planes, killing six Americans whose only “crime” was trying to rescue Cuban refugees at sea. Had a political candidate in Latin America pasted up a picture of Che at election time, there’d be no doubt where he stood — ones who did just that are now running countries with names like Bolivia and Venezuela. Is that what Obama really stands for?

FINALLY the REAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE
It appears this might be getting legs, we can only hope!
CAN’T BELIEVE SNOPES VERIFIED THIS AS TRUE, SINCE THEY TEND TO DENY ANY OTHER FACTS ABOUT HIM.
Obamas authentic birth certificate from Coast Memorial Hospital , in Mombasa , KENYA . Now the task is to get the courts to authenticate it and then kick Obama out of office, something they are loathe to do.
 
Here it is! The document we have been waiting for! Now if only Congress or the Supreme Court will act on this!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-pin/	Barack Obama Explains Why He Didn’t Follow Protocol During the National Anthem	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Version 1
  Hot on the heels of his explanation for why he no longer wears a flag pin, presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama was forced to explain why he doesn’t follow protocol when the National Anthem is played.
According to the United States Code, Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171, During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart.
“As I’ve said about the flag pin, I don’t want to be perceived as taking sides,” Obama said. “There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song ‘I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing.’ If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.”
WHAAAAAAAT!!!!!!!!!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this could possibly be our next president.  I, for once, am speechless
Version 2
PLEASE READ AND FORWARD WITHOUT CHANGING OR ADDING A SINGLE WORD
WOW!!! MUST READ OBAMA’S BELIEFS ON FLAG  and, he, like ABC news reporters does not wear American Flag lapel pins, as the wish to appear neutral, neutral to whom, and for what?
MY God! I hope every one is listening, before it is to late.
Subject: Wow
Perhaps there are SOME out there who are beginning to get ‘the picture’. The following is a narrative taken from Sunday Morning’s televised ‘Meet The Press’. and the author is employed by none other than the Washington Post!! Yeah……the Washington Post of New York and Los Angeles Times fame!! Must say that I’m dually impressed………………
From Sunday’s Televised ‘Meet the Press’ Senator Obama was asked about his stance on the American Flag. Obama Explains National Anthem Stance
Sun, 07 Sept. 2008 11:48:04 EST, General Bill Ginn’ USAF (ret.) asked Obama to explain why he doesn’t follow protocol when the National Anthem is played.
The General also stated to the Senator that according to the United States Code,
Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171… During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform are expected to stand at attention
facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. At the very least, ‘Stand and Face It’
Senator Obama Live on Sunday states, ‘As I’ve said about the flag pin, I don’t want to be perceived as taking sides, Obama said. ‘There are a lot of people in the world  to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song ‘I’d Like To Teach the World To Sing.’ If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.’We should consider to reinvent our National Anthem as well as to redesign our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love. It’s my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we as a Nation of warring people, should conduct ourselves as the nations of Islam, whereas peace prevails. Perhaps a state or period of mutual concord between our governments. When I become President, I will seek a pact or agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation have placed upon the nations of Islam an unfair injustice. My wife disrespects the Flag for many personal reasons. Together she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past, many years ago. She has her views and I have mine’. Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put aside my hatred. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path of hope. My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country’s First Family. Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America.
WHAAAAAAAT the Hell !!!
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you heard it right. This could possibly be our next President.
I, for one, am speechless.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-veteran-insurance/	The Obama administration plans to require private insurance carriers toreimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the treatment servicerelated injuries of military personnel  Truth!	but Cancelled				2015/03/17	" 
Version 1:
Dear Friends and Family, 
I know many of you voted for our current president, based on his ideas for change in this country. I was not a supporter of his, and even though I did not vote for him I had hoped he would do what he said and not what his voting record stated. 
However it seems as if my first impression of him was accurate. 
Before I decided to send out this email and check my facts from different sources, as I did not want to pass on speculation or rumor. 
If you have not heard Mr. Obama would like for our Men and women serving in the military wounded in service of our country to pay for their medical care. He feels they should obtain private insurance to pay for these injuries. I am only assuming at the moment but it would be my guess, that he would never ask for workman’s compensation to be revoked. However that is what he proposes for our Military members. 
I am outraged that the Commander and Chief of our Armed services would propose such an action. Please contact your senators and congressional leaders to make sure that this never comes to pass. 
It is because of these brave service members both past and present, that we have the freedoms that we enjoy. 
Here are several websites confirming this. http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/10/veterans.health.insurance/index.html http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/mar/17/veterans-health-care-may-go-private/ http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_11929167?source=rss 
I don’t usually spout off about such things, but my husband and many more military members have served their country with honor. Making sure military members who have been injured while serving their country have health care is the least we can do for them.
 
 Version 2:
OBAMA IS SURPRISED THAT THE MILITARY WANTS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF HERE IS HIS RESPONSE WHEN HE BACKED OFF FROM HIS DECISION TO LET THE MILITARY PAY FOR THEIR WAR INJURIES………WHAT A EMPTY HEADED PERSON HE MUST BE….SEND THIS TO EVERYONE TO SHOW JUST WHAT HE THINKS OF OUR MILITARY WHO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND GET HURT PROTECTING OUR FREEDOM!!! 
Bad press, including major mockery of the plan by comedian Jon Stewart, led to President Obama abandoning his proposal to require veterans carry private health insurance to cover the estimated $540 million annual cost to the fede ral government of treatment for injuries to military personnel received during their tours on active duty.
 The President admitted that he was puzzled by the magnitude of the opposition to his proposal.. “Look, it’s an all volunteer force,” Obama complained..
“Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn’t compute…” “I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country,” Obama continued. “I wasn’t asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I’d have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation’s deficit. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans.” 
Please pass this on to every vet and their families whom you know.  
Version 3:
 He doesn’t seem to have much respect for the military.  Maybe in the future our leaders should be veterans. 
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THIS!! 
 THE MOST STUPID STATEMENT EVER BY A PRESIDENT-Unbelievable 
THIS MOST UNBELIEVABLE PRESIDENT?
 HERE IS HIS RESPONSE WHEN HE BACKED OFF FROM HIS DECISION TO REQUIRE THE MILITARY PAY FOR THEIR WAR INJURIES. 
Bad press, including major mockery of the play by comedian Jon Stewart, led to President Obama abandoning his proposal to require veterans carry private health insurance to cover the estimated $540 billion annual cost to the federal government of treatment for injuries to military personnel received during their tours  on active duty. The President admitted that he was puzzled by the magnitude of the opposition to his proposal.
 “Look, it’s an all volunteer force,” Obama complained. “Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn’t compute..” “I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country, “Obama continued “I wasn’t asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I’d have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation’s deficit.. 
I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans.” 
Please pass this on to every one including every vet and their families whom you know. How in the world did a person with this mindset become our leader? 
REMEMBER THIS STATEMENT….”Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?”

LIE # 1.) Selma Got Me Born – LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 – Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. (Google ‘Obama Selma’ for his full March 4, 2007 speech and articles about its various untruths.)

Barack Hussein Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother’s side and 43.75% Arabic and 6.25% African Negro from his father’s side. While Barack Hussein Obama’s father was from Kenya , his father’s family was mainly Arabs.

12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion – LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify – your classmates said you were just fine.

24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess – LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens . You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books.
25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America – LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill.
26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois – LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part.

40.) I don’t Have Lobbysists – LIAR, you have over 47 lobbyists, and counting.
41.) My Campaign Had Nothing To Do With The 1984 Ad – LIAR, your own campaign worker made the ad on his Apple in one afternoon.
42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace – LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients.
43.) I Inspire People With My Words – LIAR, you inspire people with other people’s words.

Unproven!				2015/03/17	" Andy Martin  2008-07-14 07:18:58 – In a blockbuster New York news conference Monday, July 14th, Andy Martin asks: “Why has Barack Obama been lying for decades about the ‘marriage’ of his parents when he knew full well he was lying? There was no marriage. How can anyone vote for Obama for president when Obama is so cowardly he can’t tell the truth to the American people?” Andy Martin’s book and writing begin to impact the presidential campaign.

OBAMA AUTHOR ANDY MARTIN FORCES OBAMA TO ADMIT HE’S ILLEGITIMATE 
MARTIN SAYS RELEASE OF HIS BEST-SELLING BOOK PROMPTS OBAMA TO PANIC, MAKE ADMISSION OF ILLEGITIMACY 
MARTIN ACCUSES OBAMA OF KNOWINGLY AND PERSISTENTLY LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR DECADES OVER HIS PARENTS’ “NON-MARRIAGE”  
MARTIN’S CONTROVERSIAL BEST SELLER STARTS TO IMPACT THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
MARTIN CALLS OBAMA A “GIRLY MAN” FOR USING HIS WIFE TO ADMIT HE’S ILLEGITIMATE; OBAMA’S NO COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ANDY SAYS  
(NEW YORK)(July 14, 2008) Legendary Chicago Internet columnist and Obama author Andy Martin will hold a New York news conference Monday, July 14th to drop the first of several bombs on the Obama campaign: Obama is illegitimate and his parents were never married. 
For the past four years one man has made Obama miserable: Chicago writer Andy Martin. Martin’s accurate original article is cited as the source of later rumors concerning Obama’s Islamic family roots. Martin has relentlessly and accurately investigated Barack Obama’s lies. 
“Obama knew we were working the ‘illegitimate’ story, and we were preparing a series of news conferences in conjunction with my book Obama: The Man Behind The Mask,” Martin will state. “The Obama campaign also knew we were planning a lawsuit over his illegitimate birth. So they tried to use Obama’s wife to do damage control. It was one of the most cowardly gestures in American political history. 
“Jesse Jackson does not have to perform surgery. Obama is a ‘girly man’ who used his wife to ooze out the truth about his lies and his parents’ lies. What kind of a commander-in-chief would the cowardly Obama be? Who would follow a leader into battle that was afraid to admit his parents were not married? 
“Barack Obama, Senior, and Anne Dunham never married. Obama knows this fact. This is also why he keeps his white grandmother a virtual prisoner; she knows too, and she won’t lie. 
“Through the past several decades Obama has pretended he ‘didn’t know’ the facts about his illegitimate birth. He thought he could get away with the big lie. And he almost did get away with it. But we kept digging. And we are still digging. We have more to come. 
“We plan two weeks of news conferences and other Obama-related disclosures, all timed to coincide with release of my book. The book was mailed to some Washington media last Friday, and Monday afternoon it will be delivered in Midtown to Fox News, MSNBC and others. Demand for review copies has been so heavy we have already had to reorder. We expect the first truckload of Obama books to reach the warehouse early next week, depending on production schedules at the printer. 
“The release of my book and attendant publicity has prompted Obama to panic. My book is the literary equivalent of a bone-jarring tackle in football, causing the ball carrier to fumble. Obama has been forced to drop the pretense his parents were married. It is time he told us the truth. His parents were never married, he knew his parents were never married; he repeatedly lied about his lack of knowledge concerning his parents’ non-marriage. He should admit that is why he keeps his white grandmother virtually imprisoned and away from any media contact. He should beg the American people for forgiveness. Otherwise, his campaign is bakacht. 
“If Obama had simply told the truth, the matter would probably be forgiven. But he repeatedly lies and pretends he ‘doesn’t know.’ The cover-up is always worse than the crime. Jesse knows the truth. That is why Jackson has contempt for Obama. 
“I criticized Obama for running a bogus campaign ad saying he grew up with a ‘strong family and strong values.’ The whole commercial was a lie. His father was a rake who never married his mother, and his mother showed abysmally poor judgment in being impregnated by a married man. Hardly a ‘strong family’ and certainly not ‘strong values.’ Quite the contrary. Shameful values is more like it. 
“His mother was promiscuous and had a child out of wedlock, in 1961, when that was still scandalous behavior. Is this Obama’s idea of ‘family values?’ Obviously, he has been deceiving the American people and hoping his advertising lies could overcome the truth. He has failed. My book is only the first step in our organized effort to deconstruct the mirage Obama created for the Democratic Party, and is now trying to re-create for the American people. Ironically, we’re running a better and more focused campaign against Obama than John McCain is.  
“We will have more to say about Obama later in the week,” Martin will state.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-georgia-ballot-case/	Georgia Judge Hears Case To Strike Barack Obama From Presidential PrimaryBallot	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
Given the testimony from today’s court case in Georgia, Obama has a lot of explaining to do. His attorney, Jablonski, was a NO SHOW as of course, was Obama.
 The following is a nutshell account of the proceedings. Promptly at 9am EST, all attorneys involved in the Obama Georgia eligibility case were called to the Judge’s chambers. This was indeed a very interesting beginning to this long awaited and important case.
 The case revolved around the Natural Born clause of the Constitution and whether or not Obama qualifies under it to serve. More to the point, if found ineligible, Obama’s name would not appear on the 2012 ballot in Georgia.
 With the small courtroom crowded, several in attendance could be seen fanning themselves with pamphlets as they waited for the return of the attorneys and the appearance of the judge.
 Obama himself, who had been subpoenaed to appear, of course was nowhere near Georgia. Instead, Obama was on a campaign swing appearing in Las Vegas and in Colorado, at tax payer expense, ignoring the court in Georgia.
 Over the last several weeks, Obama’s attorney, Michael Jablonski, had attempted several tactics to keep this case from moving forward. He first tried to have it dismissed, then argued that it was irrelevant to Obama. After that, Jablonski argued that a state could not, under the law, determine who would or would not be on a ballot and later, that Obama was simply too busy with the duties of office to appear.
 After all these arguments were dispatched by the Georgia Court, Jablonski, in desperation, wrote to the Georgia Secretary of State attempting to place Obama above the law and declared that the case was not to he heard and neither he nor his client would participate.
 Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, fired back a letter hours later telling Jablonski he was free to abandon the case and not participate but that he would do so at his and his clients peril.
 It appears Jablonski is not in attendance as the attorneys return, all go to the plaintiff table 24 minutes after meeting in the judge’s chambers. Has Obama’s attorney made good on his stated threat not to participate? Is he directly ignoring the court’s subpoena? Is he placing Obama above the law? It seems so. Were you or I subpoenaed to appear in court, would we or our attorney be allowed such action or, non action?
 Certainly not.
 Court is called to order.
Obama’s birth certificate is entered into evidence.
Obama’s father’s place of birth, Kenya East Africa is entered into evidence.
Pages 214 and 215 from Obama’s book, “Dreams from My Father” entered into evidence. Highlighted. This is where Obama indicates that, in 1966 or 1967 that his father’s history is mentioned. It states that his father’s passport had been revoked and he was unable to leave Kenya.
Immigration Services documents entered into evidence regarding Obama Sr.
June 27th, 1962, is the date on those documents. Obama’s father’s status shown as a non citizen of the United States. Documents were gotten through the Freedom of Information Act.
Testimony regarding the definition of Natural Born Citizen is given citing Minor vs Happersett opinion from a Supreme Court written opinion from 1875. The attorney points out the difference between “citizen” and “Natural Born Citizen” using charts and copies of the Minor vs Happersett opinion.
It is also pointed out that the 14th Amendment does not alter the definition or supersede the meaning of Natural Born. It is pointed out that lower court rulings do not conflict with the Supreme Court opinion nor do they over rule the Supreme Court Minor vs Happersett opinion.
The point is, to be a natural born citizen, one must have 2 parents who, at the time of the birth in question, be citizens of the United States. As Obama’s father was not a citizen, the argument is that Obama, constitutionally, is ineligible to serve as President.
Judge notes that as neither Obama nor his attorney is present, action will be taken accordingly.
Carl Swinson takes the stand.
Testimony is presented that the SOS has agreed to hear this case, laws applicable, and that the DNC of Georgia will be on the ballot and the challenge to it by Swinson.
2nd witness, a Mr. Powell, takes the stand and presents testimony regarding documents of challenge to Obama’s appearance on the Georgia ballot and his candidacy.
Court records of Obama’s mother and father entered into evidence.
Official certificate of nomination of Obama entered into evidence.
RNC certificate of nomination entered into evidence.
DNC language does NOT include language stating Obama is Qualified while the RNC document DOES. This shows a direct difference trying to establish that the DNC MAY possibly have known that Obama was not qualified.
Jablonski letter to Kemp yesterday entered into evidence showing their desire that these proceedings not take place and that they would not participate.

Dreams From My Father entered.
Mr. Allen from Tuscon AZ sworn in.
Disc received from Immigration and Naturalization Service entered into evidence. This disc contains information regarding the status of Obama’s father received through the Freedom of Information Act.
This information states clearly that Obama’s father was NEVER a U.S. Citizen.
At this point, the judge takes a recess.
The judge returns.
David Farrar takes the stand.
Evidence showing Obama’s book of records listing his nationality as Indoneasan. Deemed not relevant by the judge.
Attorney Ms. Orly Taitz calls 2nd witness. Mr. Strump.
Enters into evidence a portion of letter received from attorney showing a renewal form from Obama’s mother for her passport listing Obama’s last name something other than Obama.
State Licensed PI takes the stand.
She was hired to look into Obama’s background and found a Social Security number for him from 1977. Professional opinion given that this number was fraudulent. The number used or attached to Obama in 1977, shows that Obama was born in the 1890. This shows that the number was originally assigned to someone else who was indeed born in 1890 and should never have been used by Obama.
Same SS number came up with addresses in IL, D.C. and MA. 
Next witness takes the stand.
This witness is an expert in information technology and photo shop. He testifies that the birth certif
icate Obama provided to the public is layered, multiple layered. This, he testifies, indicates that different parts of the certificate have been lifted from more than one original document.
Linda Jordan takes the stand.
Document entered regarding SS number assigned to Obama. SS number is not verified under E Verify. It comes back as suspected fraudulent. This is the system by which the Government verifies ones citizenship.
Next witness.
Mr. Gogt.
Expert in document imaging and scanners for 18 years.
Mr. Gogt testifies that the birth certificate, posted online by Obama, is suspicious. States white lines around all the type face is caused by “unsharp mask” in Photoshop. Testifies that any document showing this, is considered to be a fraud.
States this is a product of layering.
Mr. Gogt testifies that a straight scan of an original document would not show such layering.
Also testifies that the date stamps shown on Obama documents should not be in exact same place on various documents as they are hand stamped. Obama’s documents are all even, straight and exactly the same indicating they were NOT hand stamped but layered into the document by computer.

Next witness, Mr. Sampson a former police officer and former immigration officer specializing in immigration fraud. Ran Obama’s SS number through database and found that the number was issued to Obama in 1977 in the state of Connecticut . Obama never resided in that state. At the time of issue, Obama was living in Hawaii.
Serial number on birth certificate is out of sequence with others issued at that hospital. Also certification is different than others and different than twins born 24 hours ahead of Obama.
Mr. Sampson also states that portion of documents regarding Mr. Sotoroe, who adopted Obama have been redacted which is highly unusual with regards to immigra tion records.
Suggests all records from Social Security, Immigration, Hawaii birth records be made available to see if there are criminal charges to be filed or not. Without them, nothing can be ruled out.
Mr. Sampson indicates if Obama is shown not to be a citizen, he should be arrested and deported and until all records are released nobody can know for sure if he is or is not a U.S. Citizen.
Taitz shows records for Barry Soretoro aka Barack Obama, showing he resides in Hawaii and in Indonesia at the same time.
Taitz takes the stand herself.
Testifies that records indicate Obama records have been altered and he is hiding his identity and citizenship.
Taitz leave the stand to make her closing arguments.
Taitz states that Obama should be found, because of the evidence presented, ineligible to serve as President.
And with that, the judge closes the hearing.
What can we take away from this?
It’s interesting.
Now, all of this has finally been entered OFFICIALLY into court records.
One huge question is now more than ever before, unanswered.
WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY?
Without his attorney present, Obama’s identity, his Social Security number, his citizenship status, and his  past are all OFFICIALLY in question.
One thing to which there seems no doubt. He does NOT qualify, under the definition of Natural Born Citizen” provided by SCOTUS opinions, to be eligible to serve as President.
What will the judge decide? That is yet to be known, but it seems nearly impossible to believe, without counter testimony or evidence, because Obama and his attorney chose not to participate, that Obama will be allowed on the Georgia ballot.
It also opens the door for such cases pending or to be brought in other states as well.
Obama is in it deep and the DNC has some…a LOT…of explaining to do unless they start looking for a new candidate for 2012.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-master-lock/	President Obama Confused State Flag for Union Banner	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
 When Obama stopped in at Master Lock in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last week, he was walking the plant and stopped to talk with a plant employee and looked up at the banner hanging on the wall and said to the worker and people around him, “It is great to be in a union shop, especially one as old as this union is ” – – – – pointing to the banner. He then said, “A Union shop since 1848” – – – and then he went on to talk on what that banner stood for and how important it was to display it and show your union support. 
 The worker then said to Obama that it was the flag of the State of Wisconsin – – which was founded in 1848, and that the shop was Non-Union. This was only reported by a local radio station in Milwaukee (1130AM) and not by the major news networks.They didn’t want to embarrass this “got no friggin’ clue”President! 
Since they didn’t do their job of reporting on this presidential visit, the only way for the news to get around is by us – on the Internet. The White House media said he skipped Wisconsin & just went to Minn & Chicago. 
Do your job; I just did mine, so voters will know what really happened here and just HOW BRIGHT THIS PRESIDENT REALLY IS !!!??? NOT!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-fannie-mae-advisors/	Fannie Mae & Lehman Execs Advising Obama	Truth & Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
If you don’t have time to read all the details in this, skip to the bottom and see where these guys are now!
Way too many exec’s who have adopted the “personally win at any cost” and “rules are for others” attitudes and are ruining our corporate structure and nations financial standing. Remind you of Enron? Does this attitude carry to political candidates?? 
Here is a quick look into 3 former Fannie Mae executives who have brought down Wall Street.
 Franklin Raines was a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Fannie Mae. Raines was forced to retire from his position with Fannie Mae when auditing discovered severe irregulaties in Fannie Mae’s accounting activities. At the time of his departure The Wall Street Journal noted, “Raines, who long defended the company’s accounting despite mounting evidence that it wasn’t proper, issued a statement late Tuesday conceding that “mistakes were made” and saying he would assume responsibility as he had earlier promised. News reports indicate the company was under growing pressure from regulators to shake up its management in the wake of findings that the company’s books ran afoul of generally accepted accounting principles for four years.” Fannie Mae had to reduce its surplus by $9 billion. 
Raines left with a “golden parachute valued at $240 Million in benefits. The Government filed suit against Raines when the depth of the accounting scandal became clear.  
  http://housingdoom.com/2006/12/18/fannie-charges/ . 
The Government noted, “The 101 charges reveal how the individuals improperly manipulated earnings to maximize their bonuses, while knowingly neglecting accounting systems and internal controls, misapplying over twenty accounting principles and misleading the regulator and the public. The Notice explains how they submitted six years of misleading and inaccurate accounting statements and inaccurate capital reports that enabled them to grow Fannie Mae in an unsafe and unsound manner.” These charges were made in 2006. The Court ordered Raines to return $50 Million Dollars he received in bonuses based on the miss-stated Fannie Mae profits. 
Get $240 million and have to give back $50 million–not bad work if you can get it. Tim Howard – Was the Chief Financial Officer of Fannie Mae. Howard “was a strong internal proponent of using accounting strategies that would ensure a “stable pattern of earnings” at Fannie. In everyday English – he was cooking the books. The Government Investigation determined that, “Chief Financial Officer, Tim Howard, failed to provide adequate oversight to key control and reporting functions within Fannie Mae,” 
On June 16, 2006, Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., asked the Justice Department to investigate hi s allegations that two former Fannie Mae executives lied to Congress in October 2004 when they denied manipulating the mortgage-finance giant’s income statement to achieve management pay bonuses. Investigations by federal regulators and the company’s board of directors since concluded that management did manipulate 1998 earnings to trigger bonuses. Raines and Howard resigned under pressure in late 2004. 
Howard’s Golden Parachute was estimated at $20 Million! 
Jim Johnson – A former executive at Lehman Brothers and who was later forced from his position as Fannie Mae CEO. A look at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight’s May 2006 report on mismanagement and corruption inside Fannie Mae, and you’ll see some interesting things about Johnson. Investigators found that Fannie Mae had hidden a  substantial amount of Johnson’s 1998 compensation from the public, reporting that it was between $6 million and $7 million when it fact it was $21 million.” Johnson is currently under investigation for taking illegal loans from Countrywide while serving as CEO of Fannie Mae. 
Johnson’s Golden Parachute was estimated at $28 Million. 
WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 
FRANKLIN RAINES? Raines works for the Obama Campaign as Chief Economic Advisor 
TIM HOWARD? Howard is also a Chief Economic Advisor to Obama 
JIM JOHNSON? Johnson hired as a Senior Obama Finance Advisor and was selected to run Obama’s Vice Presidential Search Committee 
You need to let people know about this email and who these crooks work for now!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-57-states/	Barack Obama Said He Was Campaigning in “57 States”and There are 57 Islamic States!	Truth! & Fiction!				2015/03/17	"
You are aware, probably, that Barack Obama lost his bearings recently and said that he was going to campaign in all 57 states. You heard this? And everybody chalked it up to, “Well, he’s tired.” It’s been such a long campaign, he’s been so many places, etc. etc. 
Well, I have here a printout from a website called the International Humanist and Ethical Union. And right in front of me I am reading and article entitled “How the Islamic states dominate the UN human rights council.” I look at the second paraagraph and do a double take. It says:
Every year from 1999 to 2005 the organization of the Islamic conference representing the 57 Islamic states has presented a resolution to the United Nations commission on human rights called combating. ”
There are 57 Islamic states .
Helloooo, everyone! Let me say it again: there are 57 ISLAMIC states!!!!
OK. Let me review. Obama said he’s going to campaign in 57 states, and now I learn that there are 57 Islamic states.
Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t know about you, but now I cannot help but wonder if that slip of Obama’s about the number of states in the United States was a far more telling slip than it is being credited as.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obamas-balls/	President Obama skips the inaugural ball honoring Medal Of Honorrecipients	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
Obama Snubs Nation’s Heroes, Becomes the First President to Skip Ball Honoring Medal of Honor Recipients in Over 50 Years 
http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/8627 
Barack Obama may have stumbled over his words briefly during his inauguration, but he made an even bigger blunder later Tuesday evening. The newly sworn-in President opted not to appear at what should have been one of the most important Balls on his agenda that evening – The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball. 
The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball was begun in 1953 for President Dwight Eisenhower’s inauguration. The event recognized recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military award. There were 48 Medal of Honor recipients in attendance, who were undoubtedly disappointed by the Commander-in-Chief’s failure to show. Over the past 56 years and 14 inaugurations, no President has skipped this event – until now. 
The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball is sponsored by the American Legion, and co-sponsored by 13 other veteran’s service organizations, including those such as the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. 
Instead of attending this ball honoring our nation’s heroes, Obama was busy making stops at 10 other official balls. Obama and his wife’s first stop was at the Neighborhood Ball. From there they went to the Home State Ball for Illinois and Hawaii, the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Youth Inaugural Ball, and the Home State Ball for Delaware and Pennsylvania. They finished off the night with brief appearances at the Mid-Atlantic, Western, Midwest, Eastern, and Southern regional Balls. 
Celebrities were a plenty at the balls, with Stevie Wonder, Shakira, Mary. J. Blige, Faith Hill, Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine, will.i.am, Sting, Mariah Carey, and Leonardo DiCaprio in attendance at the Neighborhood Ball. In addition, the other nine balls also featured a star-studded lineup including Kanye West and Kid Rock at the Youth Ball, Marc Anthony at the Western Ball, and Cheryl Crow at the Western Ball. 
It was the party without all of the celebrities that Obama skipped. The very people who he sought to have support him during his candidacy and campaign, who have fought to protect this country, were snubbed in favor of publicity and the opportunity to rub shoulders – yet again – with the out-of-touch Hollywood elite.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obamatidalwave/	Obama Tidal Wave	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Obama  
By Bill Brown of the Billy Graham Team 
 
Bill Brown, is a highly respected retired member of the Billy Graham team so, I take his assessment of Obama very seriously and for that reason accept his challenge to pass this on. I share his concern about the ‘rock star’ image Obama has and watch with growing concern at the celebrity status the media has foisted upon him. Here is hope this email informs you in a wise way.  ________________________________  
The Obama Tidal Wave  
We are witnessing a political phenomenon with Barack Obama of rare magnitude.  
His speeches have inspired millions and yet most of his followers have no idea of what he stands for except platitudes of ‘Change’ or that he says he will be a ‘Uniter’.  
The power of speech from a charismatic person truly can be a powerful thing. Certainly Billy Graham had charisma. Both his manner of speech and particularly the content changed millions.  
On the extreme other hand, the charisma of Adolph Hitler, too, inspired millions and the results were catastrophic.  
Barack Obama certainly is no Hitler or a Billy Graham, but for many Americans riding on the Obama Tidal Wave it is just like a surfer who might be ecstatic and euphoric while riding a tidal wave, but the reality of the ride is what happens when it hits shore.  
Just Some of What Defines Barack Obama:  
· He voted for partial birth abortion.  · He voted no on notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions.  · Supports affirmative action in Colleges and Government (quotas).  · In 2001 he questioned harsh penalties for drug dealing as being too severe.  · Says he will deal with street level drug dealing as minimum wage affair.  · Admitted his use of marijuana and cocaine in high school and in college.  · His religious convictions are very murky.  · He is willing to meet with Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Jung Il and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  · Has said that one of his first goals after being elected would be to have a conference with all Muslim nations. Why?  · Opposed the Patriot Act.  & First bill he signed that was ever passed was campaign finance reform.  · Voted to allow law suits against gun manufacturers.  · Supports universal health-care.  · Voted yes on providing habeas corpus for Guantanamo detainees.  · Supports granting driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants.  · Supports extending welfare to illegal immigrants.  · Voted yes on comprehensive immigration reform.  · Voted yes on allowing illegal aliens to participate in Social Security.  · Wants to make the minimum wage a ‘living wage’.  · Voted with Democratic Party 96 percent of 251 votes. (241 votes Demo, 10 votes Republican)  · Is a big believer in the separation of church and state?  · Opposed to any efforts to Privatize Social Security and instead supports increasing the amount of tax paid into Social. Sec. Tax Increase.  · He voted No on repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax which now hits middle income brackets. Tax Increase?  · He voted No on repealing the ‘Death’ Tax. Tax Increase?  · He wants to raise the Capital Gains Tax. Tax Increase?  · Has repeatedly said the surge in Iraq has not succeeded…which is not true.  · He is ranked as the most liberal Senator in the Senate today and that takes some doing.  
If your political choices are consistent with Barack Obama’s and you think that his positions will bring America together or make it a better place, then you will probably enjoy the ride and not forward this Email. If you are like most Americans that after examining what he stands for are truly not in line with his record, it would be prudent to get off the wave or better yet, never get on, before it comes on shore and undermines the very foundations of this great Country. We have limited time to save America or the Supreme Court as we know it.  
Inaction is action.  
If you agree this is important, pass it on. The mainstream media will not do it for you!

No it is not the teleprompters. See the other president’s pics for a clue. What is missing at Barack Hussein Obama’s press conference?  BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA (aka BARRY SOETORO )

GEORGE WALKER BUSH
WILLIAM JEFFERSON BLYTHE CLINTON
GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH
RONALD WILSON REAGAN 

That’s right…no American flags!!! And I don’t believe it was just an accident! It is intentional. So I ask, why is it intentional? 


He told you he would change America, didn’t he ? This man, whoever he really is, is not an American. He and his ilk want to end the American Free Enterprise System. And we have let them go a pretty good way to doing that. Will you vote in November ? 


Vote in November like your way of life depended on it !  
Other Version with same basic photos:
For a long time, we have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in.  The Oval Office is now stripped of the traditional red, white, and blue, and replaced with middle eastern wallpaper, drapes, and decor.. 
 The hallway that he walks out of to talk to the press now has middle eastern chairs, drapes, etc. And the thing that has bothered me the most is the bright yellow drape behind him every time he speaks from the white house. It has Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning.  
Today I received this and it clearly shows what I have been noticing. That bright yellow curtain is highly visible, but as you scroll down, you will see what is predominantly absent. Also, as you look at the pictures of other presidents speaking from the same spot, look at the traditional ‘American’ background and decor as opposed to the new decor. Trust me when I say that this is intentional. It should alarm every American. What is missing at Barack Hussein Obama’s press conference?  No it is not the teleprompters. See the other presidents pics for a clue. 
BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA 
GEORGE WALKER BUSH

That’s right…no American flags!!! 
Vote in November like your way of life depends on it! Because it does!!!!!

Aissa Wayne Wrote Barack Obama’s Social Security Number is a Fake"	Fiction! 				2015/03/17	"The Plot Thickens

 

An intensive investigation has revealed the identity of the man whose Social Security number (SSN) is being used by President Obama: Jean Paul Ludwig, who was born in France in 1890, emigrated to the United States in 1924, and was assigned SSN 042-68-4425 (Obama’s current SSN) in or about March 1977.
Ludwig lived most of his adult life in Connecticut. Because of that, his SSN begins with the digits 042, which are among only a select few reserved for Connecticut residents.
Obama never lived or worked in that state! Therefore, there is no reason on earth for his SSN to start with the digits 042. None whatsoever!
Now comes the best part! Ludwig spent the final months of his life in Hawaii, where he died.
Conveniently, Obama’s grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham, worked part-time in the Probate Office in the Honolulu Hawaii Courthouse, and therefore had access to the SSNs of deceased individuals.
The Social Security Administration was never informed of Ludwig’s death, and because he never received Social Security benefits there were no benefits to stop and therefore, no questions were ever raised.
The suspicion, of course, is that Dunham, knowing her grandson was not a U.S. citizen, either because he was born in Kenya or became a citizen of Indonesia upon his adoption by Lolo Soetoro simply scoured the probate records until she found someone who died who was not receiving Social Security benefits, and selected Mr. Ludwigs Connecticut SSN for Obama.
Just wait until Trump gets past the birth certificate and onto the issue of Barry O’s use of a stolen SSN. You will see leftist heads exploding, because they will have no way of defending Obama.
Although many Americans do not understand the meaning of the term “natural born” there are few who do not understand that if you are using someone else’s SSN it is a clear indication of fraud.
2014 Version:
For those of you who don’t know …at the very bottom of this article the attorney who authored this is John Wayne’s daughter, also a Graduate of USC…

You probably already know this, but in case it slipped your mind, here’s a reminder of some recent history….(she died on April 8, 2013)
President Obama was a no-show at Margaret Thatcher’s funeral despite being invited to attend and thus snubbing England’s invitation as a representative of the American people.
Joe Biden also refused, as did Hillary Clinton. (By the way, former Secretary of State George Schultz went to the funeral……)
The British took note of the fact that the Obama administration chose not to send a single senior member of the Cabinet.
In fact, no actively serving, elected Democrat attended Lady Thatcher’s funeral.
The Obama Administration did, however, send a formal delegation to the funeral of Socialist Dictator Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who died last month.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obamacare-endorsements/	President Obama Worked BehindtheScenes Deals to Get the AMA and AARP toEndorse Health Care Reform	Commentary!				2015/03/17	" OBAMACARE ENDORSEMENTS: WHAT THE BRIBE WAS AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT  
By DICK MORRIS & EILEEN MCGANN 
Published on TheHill.com on November 6, 2009
As the suicidal Democratic congressmen proceed to rubber-stamp the Obama healthcare reform despite the drubbing their party took in the ’09 elections, the president trotted out the endorsements of the AMA and the AARP to stimulate support. But these — and the other endorsements — his package has received are all bought and paid for. 
Here are the deals: 
* The American Medical Association (AMA) was facing a 21 percent cut in physicians’ reimbursements under the current law. Obama promised to kill the cut if they backed his bill. The cuts are the fruit of a law requiring annual 5-6 percent reductions in doctor reimbursements for treating Medicare patients. Bravely, each year Congress has rolled the cuts over, suspending them but not repealing them. So each year, the accumulated cuts threaten doctors. By now, they have risen to 21 percent. With this blackmail leverage, Obama compelled the AMA to support his bill…or else! 
* The AARP got a financial windfall in return for its support of the healthcare bill. Over the past decade, the AARP has morphed from an advocacy group to an insurance company (through its subsidiary company). It is one of the main suppliers of Medi-gap insurance, a high-cost, privately purchased coverage that picks up where Medicare leaves off. But President Bush-43 passed the Medicare Advantage program, which offered a subsidized, lower-cost alternative to Medi-gap. Under Medicare Advantage, the elderly get all the extra coverage they need plus coordinated, well-managed care, usually by the same physician. So more than 10 million seniors went with Medicare Advantage, cutting into AARP Medi-gap revenues. 
Presto! Obama solved their problem. He eliminates subsidies for Medicare Advantage. The elderly will have to pay more for coverage under Medigap, but the AARP — which supposedly represents them — will make more money. (If this galls you, join the American Seniors Association, the alternative group; contact sbarton@americanseniors..org. This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it .) 
* The drug industry backed ObamaCare and, in return, got a 10-year limit of $80 billion on cuts in prescription drug costs. (A drop in the bucket of their almost $3 trillion projected cost over the next decade.) They also got administration assurances that it will continue to bar lower-cost Canadian drugs from coming into the U.S. All it had to do was put its formidable advertising budget at the disposal of the administration. 
* Insurance companies got access to 40 million potential new customers. But when the Senate Finance Committee lowered the fine that would be imposed on those who don’t buy insurance from $3,500 to $1,500, the insurance companies jumped ship and now oppose the bill, albeit for the worst of motives. 
The only industry that refused to knuckle under was the medical device makers. They stood for principle and wouldn’t go along with Obama’s blackmail. So the Senate Finance Committee retaliated by imposing a tax on medical devices such as automated wheelchairs, pacemakers, arterial stents, prosthetic limbs, artificial knees and hips and other necessary accoutrements of healthcare. 
So these endorsements are not freely given, but bought and paid for by an administration that is intent on passing its program at any cost.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-auschwitz/	Barack Obama Was Wrong When he Claimed That His Uncle Helped LiberateAuschwitz	Truth!				2015/03/17	"  Obama lied about his uncle’s service in World War II:
 From a news report:
 “Obama also spoke about his uncle, who was part of the American brigade that helped to liberate Auschwitz. He said the family legend is that, upon returning from war, his uncle spent six months in an attic. “Now obviously, something had really affected him deeply, but at that time there just weren’t the kinds of facilities to help somebody work through that kind of pain,” Obama said. “That’s why this idea of making sure that every single veteran, when they are discharged, are screened for post-traumatic stress disorder and given the mental health services that they need – that’s why it’s so important.”
 Well—his uncle must have been a Russian, because it was the Russians who liberated Auschwitz and then occupied Poland, not the Americans.
 Obama did it again!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-christmas-tree-tax/	U.S. Department of Agriculture Plans to Levy a Tax on ChristmasTrees	Truth! But Postponed!				2015/03/17	" 
President Obama’s Agriculture Department today announced that it will impose a new 15-cent charge on all fresh Christmas trees—the Christmas Tree Tax—to support a new Federal program to improve the image and marketing of Christmas trees. 
In the Federal Register of November 8, 2011, Acting Administrator of Agricultural Marketing David R. Shipman announced that the Secretary of Agriculture will appoint a Christmas Tree Promotion Board. The purpose of the Board is to run a “program of promotion, research, evaluation, and information designed to strengthen the Christmas tree industry’s position in the marketplace; maintain and expend existing markets for Christmas trees; and to carry out programs, plans, and projects designed to provide maximum benefits to the Christmas tree industry” (7 CFR 1214.46(n)). And the program of “information” is to include efforts to “enhance the image of Christmas trees and the Christmas tree industry in the United States” (7 CFR 1214.10). 
To pay for the new Federal Christmas tree image improvement and marketing program, the Department of Agriculture imposed a 15-cent fee on all sales of fresh Christmas trees by sellers of more than 500 trees per year (7 CFR 1214.52). And, of course, the Christmas tree sellers are free to pass along the 15-cent Federal fee to consumers who buy their Christmas trees.

 Barack, his wife and the two girls are traveling to India on November 6th (right after the election) for a State visit. (Just a visitation; no official government business) Here are a few highlights:
 *Obama booked all 570 rooms, banquet rooms, and restaurants at the 5-star Taj Mahal Hotel. *Additionally, they booked 125 rooms at the Taj President and 80 to 90 rooms at each the Grand Hyatt and Oberoi Hotels. The NCPA is also totally booked, where Obama will meet with business leaders. *Meanwhile, Michelle will be meeting with “commercial sex workers” in Mumbai. (curious choice) *He will take between 800 people plus staff with him *He is taking BOTH Air Force ones and BOTH Marine one helicopters (to be used to ferry the Obamas around on their sightseeing). *They are taking a total of 40 aircraft *45 cars will be in his motorcade including his Lincoln Continental. *Security will be huge, including the Navy and Coast Guard patrolling the sea front to negate the possibility of a missile being fired. And 35-40 Secret Service agents will arrive in India prior to November 6th. *Obama is taking his personal staff, including his chefS, “not because his dislikes Indian food, but to ensure that his food is not spiked”.
Google his trip for more information and to verify the information above. This “dude” (his newest nickname) truly must think he is King! Some how he needs to be stopped! This is all happening while our country is suffering from unemployment, bad economy and excessive spending. These factors are obviously not important to Obama who has time to appear on TV comedy shows and play golf. What a crying shame!

 Obama Administration Announces Nationwide Muslim Outreach Program For Children Grades K-12
Washington, DC — At a press conference today, President Obama announced plans for the first ever federally funded Muslim outreach program. The program will be available nationwide for all elementary school students grade K-12 beginning February 1st, 2014. The program is designed to educate children about the fundamentals of the Muslim religion and Islamic belief. 
President Obama spoke with reporters to explain why it is so important that these outreach programs exist. “The Muslim community deserves our full understanding and respect,” Obama said. “We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. These folks are not all bad. In fact, most of them are hardworking citizens just like you and me. I encourage every student in America to participate in your school’s Muslim outreach program. Learn about the Muslim community, the beauty of the Sunnah and the magic of the Qur’an.” 
35-year-old Paul Horner, a teacher at Starks Elementary School in Louisiana, told MSNBC he is excited about the new program. “I think anything a child can learn is good.

Other Version: This is no surprise to me. If Christians, Jews, or any other group is denied, they won’t be beheading these school leaders but the Muslim terrorists will. 
 Did you know that Hilliard, Ohio has a special room for Muslims to pray in the High School? YES, call the school if you aren’t believing. Sorry NO CHRISTIAN, Jewish or any other religion available. This was checked out on Politi facts and confirmed. 
 I can’t begin to tell you how livid I am over this. Our children are not allowed to recite the Lord’s Prayer, not allowed to bring a Bible to school, not allowed to wear a Christian themed T-Shirt, not allowed to have Bible study classes at school, not allowed to display a picture of Jesus, and now this Piece of Crap President is going to use federal tax dollars to promote Islam to our children.
 Enough is ENOUGH ! Where are all these “Christian-hating, separation of church and state” atheists? Why aren’t they lining up the to sue the federal government over the use of federal tax dollars to promote a religion in our public schools? I would be willing to bet that nobody will hear a peep out of the “Freedom From Religion” organization.

35-year-old Paul Horner, a teacher at Starks Elementary School in Louisiana , told MSNBC he is excited about the new programs. “I think anything a child can learn is good. We need more learning in this country. And, these classes are not mandatory but children can use them as extra credit towards other classes.
For example, if Becky has a D+ in math she can simply take a three week after school class on the Qur’an and now Sally has an A in Math. How great is that?”
The Muslim youth outreach program is designed to help young people from different cultures work together to break down ethnic barriers. Their goal is to help promote a greater respect for other cultures, understanding while at the same time learning about all that culture has to offer.
Khaled Matei, who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood‘s Freedom and Justice Party, told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions. “I spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community,” Matei said. “This is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.” If any parents of students would like to volunteer to teach the Muslim religion you can call the United States Muslim Outreach hotline at (785) XXX-XXXX.
 Do we do this for other cultures and religions? NO Do we federally fund religion for other religions? NO PLEASE SHARE WITH EVERYONE . . . .. . I JUST DID !

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-tees-off-golfers/	Presidential Visit to Golf Course Rudely Delayed Other Players	Unproven!				2015/03/17	" Arrogant Bastard!

This is a message from my friend, who is vacationing in Honolulu.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
My wife and I are on Oahu for our annual Hawaii trip with good friends and two granddaughters enjoying the hospitality of the Hawaiian people on this lovely Island. Being retired military allows us the privilege of using the military facilities and especially the highly desirable golf courses.
Yesterday, Jan 4, we had a tee time of 12:04 to play golf at Kaneohe Marine Corps on Oahu. We arrived early because we were advised the President was possibly going to play but also that he was leaving to fly back to D.C. that same day.
We checked in and were second off and waiting for carts when we were advised that he really may be coming but there was no count of when or how many in the party. We then got body scanned, our golf bags searched and briefed on the proper behavior expected. He and his party finally arrived at 1:00 and he then hit balls on the range and then drove right in front of us on his way to the first tee hollering Happy New Year to the small group ( 50 or so) golfers waiting to play. They keep two holes clear for him both front and rear and the secret service used 30 carts in all. After he teed off they went down the first fairway and I spotted a single golfer going to the first tee. I hollered at him to get off and he slowly ambled my way and when within talking distance he said he was White House staff and was allowed within the two hole space. I cannot repeat what I said to him. We were finally allowed to tee off at 1:30 and watched as the President bullied his way thru all the young Marines who were able to take a day off as they prepared to go to wherever to protect us all. No words of thank you for your service or how are you doing, just he and three of his civilian high school buddies messing up the day for many. They would make the two groups ahead of his progress move to the side and allow the group to play through.
It really is bothersome to view firsthand the egotistic ass that is our President. I asked numerous marines who were standing around what they thought of him and not one of the thirty or so had any kind words. The common refrain was why did he not come out and join a threesome of young Marines and play golf with them. That would have been so appropriate. Why doesn’t his staff make a tee time like all of us and cancel if necessary? That would eliminate all the confusion. Why does he not respect the lives of all around him instead of being so arrogant.
Thank God he left last evening. We were out there for 5 1/2 hours and quit after 14 holes and left the course with a total lack of respect for our President.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-afghanistan/	Obama shunned U.S. Soldiers in Afghanistan	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Hello everyone,  
As you know I am not a very political person. I just wanted to pass along that Senator Obama came to Bagram Afghanistan for about an hour on his visit to “The War Zone”. I wanted to share with you what happened. He got off the plane and got into a bullet proof vehicle, got to the area to meet with the Major General (2 Star) who is the commander here at Bagram. As the Soldiers where lined up to shake his hand he blew them off and didn’t say a word as he went into the conference room to meet the General. As he finished, the vehicles took him to the ClamShell (pretty much a big top tent that military personnel can play basketball or work out in with weights) so he could take his publicity pictures playing basketball. He again shunned the opportunity to talk to Soldiers to thank them for their service. So really he was just here to make a showing for the American’s back home that he is their candidate for President. I think that if you are going to make an effort to come all the w ay over here you would thank those that are providing the freedom that they are providing for you. 
I swear we got more thanks from the NBA Basketball Players or the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders than from one of the Senators, who wants to be the President of the United States. I just don’t understand how anyone would want him to be our Commander-and-Chief. It was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country. If this is blunt and to the point I am sorry but I wanted you all to know what kind of caliber of person he really is. What you see in the news is all fake. 
In service,

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-church/	Barack Obama's Church is Committed to Africa, not the U.S., and onlyAfrican Americans are Admitted for Membership	Truth! & Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Obama mentioned his church during his appearance with Oprah. It’s   the Trinity Church of Christ. I found this interesting.
  Obama’s church:  Please read and go to this church’s website and read what is written  there. It is very alarming.  Barack Obama is a member of this church and is running for President  of the U.S. If you look at the first page of their website, you will learn  that this congregation has a non-negotiable  commitment to Africa. No where is AMERICA even mentioned. Notice too,  what color you will need to be if you should want to join  Obama’s church… B-L-A-C-K!!! Doesn’t look like his choice of  religion has improved much over his (former?) Muslim upbringing.  Strip away his nice looks, the big smile and smooth talk and what do  you get? Certainly a racist, as plainly defined by the stated position of  his church! And possibly a covert worshiper of the Muslim faith, even   today.  This guy desires to rule over America  while his loyalty is totally vested in a Black Africa!  I cannot believe this has not been all over the TV and newspapers.  This is why it is so important to pass this message along to all of  our family & friends. To think that Obama has even the slightest  chance in the run for the presidency, is really scary.  Click on the link below:  This is the web page for the church Barack Obama belongs to:

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-john316/	Barack Obama Quotes The Bible?	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
Worth thinking about… The Lord has a way of revealing to those of us who really know Him and those that don’t!!! 
Think about it! Obama gave a big speech last week about how his faith is so “important” to him. In an attempt to convince the American people that we should consider him for president, he said his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3. Of course the speech writers meant John 3:16, but nobody in the Obama camp is familiar enough with scripture to catch the error.
 Do you know what John 16:3 really says? “And they will do this because they have not known the Father nor Me.” 
The Holy Spirit works in strange ways. Pass it on!

Shocking Photo of Obama’s SECOND Swearing In
Barack Obama really is a Muslim! Notice that during the second swearing in ceremony (which was purposely bungled so that Obama would not have to really swear on a Bible as a Christian), Obama has his Imam serve as a witness to the real swearing in ceremony, since Islamic law forbids a Muslim to swear an oath on the Koran!
This photo was not supposed to be leaked out to the press and the administration is now doing damage control trying to get all copies back, but it’s out on the internet now and there’s no stopping it.

 For those of you who think that all of the opposition to Sarah Palin is from”leftwing” nuts; the following is a list of books that she tried to get banned when she was mayor of Wasilla. I am not sure that Mark Twain,William Shakespeare, Maya Angelou and Geofrey Chaucer would be considered dangerous to children. Judy Blume give me a break. Harry Potter, who is kidding who. I also fail to see how Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary by the Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff should be banned.
 This information is taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. When the librarian refused Palin tried to get her fired as she did with the Safety Director of the State who refused to fire a trooper who was getting a vicious divorce from her sister
She also told her Assembly of God Church in June 2008 that it is “God’s Will” that the federal government contribute to the expansion of the Alaska pipeline.

Better late than never (I guess- Better NEVER than late, but nobody cared in 2008)
Finally, Matt Patterson and Newsweek speak out about Obama. This is timely and tough. As many of you know, Newsweek has a reputation for being extremely liberal. The fact that their editor saw fit to print the following article about Obama and the one that appears in the latest Newsweek, makes this a truly amazing event, and a news story in and of itself. At last, the truth about our President and his agenda are starting to trickle through the “protective wall” built around him by the liberal media.

I Too Have Become Disillusioned.
By Matt Patterson ( columnist – opinion writer)
Years from now, historians may regard the 2008 election of Barack Obama as an inscrutable and disturbing phenomenon, the result of a baffling breed of mass hysteria akin perhaps to the witch craze of the Middle Ages. How, they will wonder, did a man so devoid of professional accomplishment beguile so many into thinking he could manage the world’s largest economy, direct the world’s most powerful military, execute the world’s most consequential job?
Imagine a future historian examining Obama’s pre-presidential life: ushered into and through the Ivy League, despite unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy non-job as a “community organizer;” a brief career as a state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in fact nearly devoid of his attention, so often did he vote “present”); and finally an unaccomplished single term in the United States Senate, the entirety of which was devoted to his presidential ambitions.
He left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature legislation as a legislator. And then there is the matter of his troubling associations: the white-hating, America-loathing preacher who for decades served as Obama’s “spiritual mentor”; a real-life, actual terrorist who served as Obama’s colleague and political sponsor. It is easy to imagine a future historian looking at it all and asking: how on Earth was such a man elected president?
Not content to wait for history, the incomparable Norman Podhoretz addressed the question recently in the Wall Street Journal: To be sure, no white candidate who had close associations with an outspoken hater of America like Jeremiah Wright and an unrepentant terrorist like Bill Ayers, would have lasted a single day. But because Mr. Obama was black, and therefore entitled in the eyes of liberal Dom to have hung out with protesters against various American injustices, even if they were a bit extreme, he was given a pass. Let that sink in: Obama was given a pass – held to a lower standard – because of the color of his skin.
Podhoretz continues: And in any case, what did such ancient history matter when he was also so articulate and elegant and (as he himself had said) “non-threatening,” all of which gave him a fighting chance to become the first black president and thereby to lay the curse of racism to rest?
Podhoretz puts his finger, I think, on the animating pulse of the Obama phenomenon – affirmative action. Not in the legal sense, of course. But certainly in the motivating sentiment behind all affirmative action laws and regulations, which are designed primarily to make white people, and especially white liberals, feel good about themselves.
Unfortunately, minorities often suffer so that whites can pat themselves on the back. Liberals routinely admit minorities to schools for which they are not qualified, yet take no responsibility for the inevitable poor performance and high drop-out rates which follow. Liberals don’t care if these minority students fail; liberals aren’t around to witness the emotional devastation and deflated self-esteem resulting from the racist policy that is affirmative action. Yes, racist. Holding someone to a separate standard merely because of the color of his skin – that’s affirmative action in a nutshell, and if that isn’t racism, then nothing is.
And that is what America did to Obama. True, Obama himself was never troubled by his lack of achievements, but why would he be? As many have noted, Obama was told he was good enough for Columbia despite undistinguished grades at Occidental; he was told he was good enough for the US Senate despite a mediocre record in Illinois; he was told he was good enough to be president despite no record at all in the Senate. All his life, every step of the way, Obama was told he was good enough for the next step, in spite of ample evidence to the contrary.
What could this breed if not the sort of empty narcissism on display every time Obama speaks? In 2008, many who agreed that he lacked executive qualifications nonetheless raved about Obama’s oratory skills, intellect, and cool character. Those people – conservatives included – ought now to be deeply embarrassed.
The man thinks and speaks in the hoariest of clichés, and that’s when he has his Teleprompters in front of him; when the prompter is absent he can barely think or speak at all. Not one original idea has ever issued from his mouth – it’s all warmed-over Marxism of the kind that has failed over and over again for 100 years.(An example is his 2012 campaign speeches which are almost word for word his 2008 speeches)
And what about his character? Obama is constantly blaming anything and everything else for his troubles.Bush did it; it was bad luck; I inherited this mess. Remember, he wanted the job, campaigned for the task. It is embarrassing to see a president so willing to advertise his own powerlessness, so comfortable with his own incompetence. (The other day he actually came out and said no one could have done anything to get our economy and country back on track.) But really, what were we to expect? The man has never been responsible for anything, so how do we expect him to act responsibly?
In short: our president is a small-minded man, with neither the temperament nor the intellect to handle his job. When you understand that, and only when you understand that, will the current erosion of liberty and prosperity make sense. It could not have gone otherwise with such a man in the Oval Office.
Original Version Of eRumor:
The Washington Post speaks out on Obama, finally!…………very brutal……timely though.


As I’m sure you know, the Washington Post newspaper has always had a reputation for being extremely liberal, so the fact that its editor saw fit to print the following article about Obama in its newspaper makes this a truly amazing event and a news story in and of itself.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-kenya/	Obama's connections with Kenya	Truth!, Unproven!, & Fiction!				2015/03/17	"  Dear Billy Sam,  
Thanks for sending out an alert about Obama. We are living and working in Kenya for almost twelve years now and know his family (tribe) well. They are the ones who were behind the recent Presidential election chaos here. Thousands of people have been displaced by election violence (over 350,000) and I don’t know the last count of the dead. Obama under “friends of Obama” gave almost a million dollars to the opposition campaign who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga, who is a socialist trained in east germany . He has been trying to bring Kenya down for years and the last president threw him in prison for trying to subvert this country! December 27th elections brought cries from ODM (Odinga Camp) of rigged election. Obama and Raila speak daily.As we watch Obama rise in the US we are sure that whatever happens, he will use the same tactic, cyring rigged election if he doesn’t win and possibly cause a race war in America .  What we would like you to know is what the american press has been keeping a dirty little secret. Obama IS a muslim and he IS a racist and this is a fullfilllment of the 911 threat that was just the beginning. Jihad is the only true muslim way. We have been working with them for 20 years this july! He is not an american as we know it. Please encourage your friends and associates not to be taken in by those that are promoting him. It is world wide jihad.All our friends in Europe are very disturbed by the mulsim infiltration into their countries. By the way. His true name is Barak Hussein Muhammed Obama. Won’t that sound sweet to our enemies as they swear him in on the Koran! God Bless you.  Pray for us here in Kenya . We are still fighting for our nation to withstand the same kind of assult that every nation, including America , is fighting. Takeover from the outside to fit the new world order. As believers, this means we will be the first targets. Here in Kenya , not one mosque was burned down, but hundreds of churches were burned down, some with people in them, burned alive.  Jesus Christ is our peace but the new world order of Globalism has infiltrated the church and confused believers into thinking that they can compromise and survive. It won’t be so. I will send you a newsletter we sent out in February documenting in a more cohesive manner what I’ve tried to say in a few paragraphs. Love, Celeste 
Celeste and Loren Davis About our Father’s business!  Luke 2:49b

If this is the kind of “change” Mr. Obama is referring to, we are definitely in for more than what has met the eye. What has happened here is not only appalling but frightening to think we may no longer have the freedom to speak against “the powers that be” without the Secret Service showing up at your door. Keeping in mind, there is no taped conversation – simply a disgruntled volunteer who was not getting the response she was looking for. Jessica has contacted several politicians and news organizations – some who have told her “this is out of my jurisdiction”. Please! Enough is enough – I for one will stand behind this young woman and notify every person I can possibly think of to make people aware of this travesty! I hope you will forward this on as well to as many people as you possibly can – especially to our elected officials and news organizations. Feel free to email me for verification.

On Wednesday the 1st of October I received a call on my cell while in the car with my husband. It was a woman who identified herself as calling from the Obama Campaign. The phone # she called from was 903-798-6020 which lists as “Obama Volunteers of Texarkana” (Texas). 
She asked if I was an Obama supporter to which I replied: 
“No, I don’t support him, your guy is a socialist who voted four times in the State Senate to let little babies die in hospital closets; I think you should find something better to do with your time.” I hung up. 
Thursday, October 2, I answered the front door to find the Secret Service. Immediately I thought of the call and was furious that apparently you are not allowed to call Obama a Socialist without the Secret Service coming to investigate. Instead, they asked me about the following comment, relayed by the Obama Volunteer of Texarkana who called me, unsolicited on my cell phone: 
“I will never support Obama and he will wind up dead on a hospital floor.” 
My husband laughed and told them “No, she called him a socialist but she never said a word about him dying.” I gave them my actual quote. The woman asked insolently “Oh? Well why would she make that up?” 
I replied that I supposed she wasn’t happy about what I said about her candidate and the Agent said “That’s right, you were rude!” The last time I checked being rude wasn’t a crime in America. 
Luckily the big file they had gathered on me didn’t indicate mental instability or a past life of stalking/crime, however they did want to know how I felt about Obama. That was my limit. I told the Agent in no uncertain terms that my thoughts were not pertinent to their investigation, that this was America and the last time I checked I was allowed to think whatever I wanted without being questioned by the Secret Service. In fact, even if I had said what she claimed, that isn’t a threat. I told them (again) and my husband verified that the statement reported by Obama’s volunteer was a lie. I asked them if there was a tape of the call and they said no. I said, “So on the word of a ticked off Obama supporter you are on my porch with no other evidence and you want to question me about my THOUGHTS!?” 
They informed me that there was no evidence she was an Obama supporter…someone calling from his campaign…are you kidding? 
I was not allowed to know the name of my accuser at which point they informed me that it wasn’t like I was in a court of law, YET, as if this was a good thing. I recognized this as a veiled threat. I told them I would happily go to court since I did nothing wrong and at least then my accuser would have to face me rather than sending the thought police to my house. 
They then said they were trying to do me a favor, that they came to me first before “embarrassing you by going to all your neighbors and family”, another threat? I told them to be my guest and talk to whomever they wanted but they weren’t going to investigate my thoughts on my porch. 
They also informed me that it would be easier if the next time a supporter calls me I just say “Yeah sure count me in, or just hang up” apparently so she won’t get her undies in a bundle and give them more useless trips. Yeah right. I said “Look, someone calls me unsolicited on my cell phone to ask me to support their candidate and I can’t tell them why I don’t?” I said I was sorry they made a wasted trip but if they had a problem with some made up lie they needed to go talk to her about it because it wasn’t my fault they had to drive from Houston for nothing. 
At one point I went inside and got a notepad to record their badge numbers and they refused to show me their badges. They had done the quick flip when they arrived. I asked for a card and the female Agent refused to give me one stating “You’re not going to get a card.” The male Agent gave me a card and told me I could contact Houston with any questions. 
The fact that the volunteer lied, the fact that the Secret Service came to my house to question me about my thoughts and feelings and threaten to embarrass me to my neighbors and go to court if I didn’t cooperate is not really the tragedy here. Because that girl on the phone doesn’t have the pull to send the Secret Service to my home. Someone high in the ranks of a campaign working for a man who may be the next President of the United States of America felt comfortable bringing the force of the Federal Government to bear on a private citizen on nothing but the word of a partisan volunteer.  
I want to file a counter complaint that false charges were made, that a false report was given to a peace officer. The Secret Service told me I cannot because they will protect the identity of the complainant. I also want the file they have on me destroyed and I want to know that my phone isn’t tapped, etcetera. I am hearing a lot of “Out of my Jurisdiction”. 
Do I also hear jackboots?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/palin-bush-pilot/	Alaskan Bush Pilot Views on Sarah Palin	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Fishing is good here at Wildman and I rarely have time for politics, but many of our friends are asking us “Who is Sarah Palin?” Of course, as Alaskans, Kathy and I are extremely proud of her. We just want to let you know that Sarah “Barracuda” Palin is a straight shooting, hard charging, get it done gal. She knows when to listen, how to analyze the facts and how to make a decision, then implement the plan. She doesn’t do a poll before jumping in with both feet like too many of the Washington types. She has little legislative experience because she has always held the EXECUTIVE position; in private life, as mayor of Anchorage’s largest bedroom community or more recently as Governor of our State. She is a smart, attractive home grown Alaska girl with excellent moral and family values. She can see what needs to be done and does not hesitate to get it done.
 One of our State’s major problems is that its Capital is in Juneau, 500 miles from the nearest road and 800 air miles from the population base which is Anchorage, Wasilla and Fairbanks. Our legislature and most of the State government is in Juneau and they ALL behave like a bunch of freshmen in a college town. It has been this way since Statehood in 1959. When Sarah moved to Juneau, so did accountability and responsibility When the oil revenue started flowing and a barrel of North Slope Crude hit $23.00, these people began spending money like drunken sailors. You can only imagine what was happening when oil hit $100.00 a barrel, about the time Sarah took command. My wife Kathy has first-hand experience with this fiasco, as her father and also her ex-husband were Alaska Legislators who served in Juneau as Senators, Senate President, or members of the State House for a combined period spanning nearly three decades. About the time Sarah took the HELM as Governor of Alaska, about half of the State legislature was in the pocket of big oil companies or contractors doing big projects for Native Corporations around Alaska, all funded by State oil revenue. Alaska government was nothing but a good old boys club riding the perpetual wave of prosperity. This filtered down from the legislature, through the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Labor and even spilled in to the Public Safety who are supposed to “preserve and protect”. 
 When Sarah walked into the Governor’s Mansion, she promptly dismissed the State Trooper detachment assigned to Governor and had her and her husband’s gun case brought in from Wasilla. Then, she got rid of the former Governor’s STATE Jet and told legislators that there were no more free rides, they would have to fly Alaska Airlines, just like her and her family if they wanted to travel. Next came the nut cutting (the Barracuda part) the heads that rolled were too numerous to name, but when Sarah finished cleaning house, a number of our legislators ended up in jail on corruption charges, or tendered their resignations along with numerous department heads and those who have been riding the gravy train for way too long, AND THEN SHE HAD LUNCH. By the end of the day, Sarah Palin had saved the people of Alaska millions and has not yet slowed down.
 She has truly brought CHANGE to Juneau. I personally know several persons in the private sector in Alaska, that hold her in high esteem. She surrounds herself with smart people, many from my hometown of Anchorage, she listens to them but makes her own decisions. Sarah Palin is a no B.S. politician. It is refreshing that there is such a thing anymore. You want to talk about CHANGE? You should see a before and after picture of the State government in Alaska. That’s CHANGE! Sarah will bring a number of things to the election. I am sure she will appeal to many voters who may otherwise have gone the other direction on election day. The conservative block will not be for Barack. We have their vote. We need what Sarah will bring, first to the election and second, what she will bring to Washington D.C. McCain has been advised well, Let’s just hope the American people can get the straight scoop on her in the weeks ahead. This is just the opinion of one Alaska Bush Pilot and Guide, who pays attention to national politics, watches the news and is deathly afraid of the direction our nation is headed. I guarantee that if Sarah gets a chance to dig her spurs into the flanks of the liberal Washington types, they will know that she is in the saddle.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/palin-national-guard/	Sarah Palin’s Security Clearance	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Subject: SARAH PALIN’S SECURITY CLEARANCE 
Before you dismiss the fact that Sarah Palin is Commander of the Alaska National Guard consider this.
Alaska is the first line of defense in our missile interceptor defense system. The 49th Missile Defense Battalion of the Alaska National Guard is the unit that protects the entire nation from ballistic missile attacks. It’s on permanent active duty, unlike other Guard units.
As governor of Alaska, Palin is briefed on highly classified military issues, homeland security, and counterterrorism. Her exposure to classified material may rival even Biden’s and certainly by far exceeds Obama’s.She’s also the commander in chief of the Alaska State Defense Force (ASDF), a federally recognized militia incorporated into Homeland Security’s counterterrorism plans.
Palin is privy to military and intelligence secrets that are vital to the entire country’s defense. Given Alaska’s proximity to Russia, she may have security clearances we don’t even know about.According to the Washington Post, she first met with McCain in February, but nobody ever found out. This is a woman used to keeping secrets.
She can be entrusted with our national security, because she already is.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/orson-scott-card/	Orson Scott Card's Open Letter To Every Local Paper in USA	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
Would the Last Honest Reporter Please Turn On the Lights?  By Orson Scott Card 
 Editor’s note: Orson Scott Card is a Democrat and a newspaper columnist, and in this opinion piece he takes on both while lamenting the current state of journalism. 
 An open letter to the local daily paper — almost every local daily paper in America :  I remember reading All the President’s Men and thinking: That’s journalism. You do what it takes to get the truth and you lay it before the public, because the public has a right to know.  This housing crisis didn’t come out of nowhere. It was not a vague emanation of the evil Bush administration.  It was a direct result of the political decision, back in the late 1990s, to loosen the rules of lending so that home loans would be more accessible to poor people. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were authorized to approve risky loans.  What is a risky loan? It’s a loan that the recipient is likely not to be able to repay.  The goal of this rule change was to help the poor — which especially would help members of minority groups. But how does it help these people to give them a loan that they can’t repay? They get into a house, yes, but when they can’t make the payments, they lose the house — along with their credit rating.  They end up worse off than before.  This was completely foreseeable and in fact many people did foresee it. One political party, in Congress and in the executive branch, tried repeatedly to tighten up the rules. The other party blocked every such attempt and tried to loosen them.  Furthermore, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were making political contributions to the very members of Congress who were allowing them to make irresponsible loans. (Though why quasi-federal agencies were allowed to do so baffles me. It’s as if the Pentagon were allowed to contribute to the political campaigns of Congressmen who support increasing their budget.)  Isn’t there a story here? Doesn’t journalism require that you who produce our daily paper tell the truth about who brought us to a position where the only way to keep confidence in our economy was a $700 billion bailout? Aren’t you supposed to follow the money and see which politicians were benefiting personally from the deregulation of mortgage lending?  I have no doubt that if these facts had pointed to the Republican Party or to John McCain as the guilty parties, you would be treating it as a vast scandal. “Housing-gate,” no doubt. Or “Fannie-gate.”  Instead, it was Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank, both Democrats, who denied that there were any problems, who refused Bush administration requests to set up a regulatory agency to watch over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and who were still pushing for these agencies to go even further in promoting sub-prime mortgage loans almost up to the minute they failed.  As Thomas Sowell points out in a TownHall.com essay entitled “Do Facts Matter?” ( http://snipurl.com/457townhall_com] ): “Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago. So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President. So did Bush’s Secretary of the Treasury.”  These are facts. This financial crisis was completely preventable. The party that blocked any attempt to prevent it was … the Democratic Party. The party that tried to prevent it was … the Republican Party.  Yet when Nancy Pelosi accused the Bush administration and Republican deregulation of causing the crisis, you in the press did not hold her to account for her lie. Instead, you criticized Republicans who took offense at this lie and refused to vote for the bailout!  What? It’s not the liar, but the victims of the lie who are to blame?  Now let’s follow the money … right to the presidential candidate who is the number-two recipient of campaign contributions from Fannie Mae.  And after Freddie Raines, the CEO of Fannie Mae who made $90 million while running it into the ground, was fired for his incompetence, one presidential candidate’s campaign actually consulted him for advice on housing.  If that presidential candidate had been John McCain, you would have called it a major scandal and we would be getting stories in your paper every day about how incompetent and corrupt he was.  But instead, that candidate was Barack Obama, and so you have buried this story, and when the McCain campaign dared to call Raines an “adviser” to the Obama campaign — because that campaign had sought his advice — you actually let Obama’s people get away with accusing McCain of lying, merely because Raines wasn’t listed as an official adviser to the Obama campaign.  You would never tolerate such weasely nit-picking from a Republican.  If you who produce our local daily paper actually had any principles, you would be pounding this story, because the prosperity of all Americans was put at risk by the foolish, short-sighted, politically selfish, and possibly corrupt actions of leading Democrats, including Obama.  If you who produce our local daily paper had any personal honor, you would find it unbearable to let the American people believe that somehow Republicans were to blame for this crisis.  There are precedents. Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9/11, you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension — so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link. (Along the way, you created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection.)  If you had any principles, then surely right now, when the American people are set to blame President Bush and John McCain for a crisis they tried to prevent, and are actually shifting to approve of Barack Obama because of a crisis he helped cause, you would be laboring at least as hard to correct that false impression.  Your job, as journalists, is to tell the truth. That’s what you claim you do, when you accept people’s money to buy or subscribe to your paper.  But right now, you are consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie — that the housing crisis should somehow be blamed on Bush, McCain, and the Republicans. You have trained the American people to blame everything bad — even bad weather — on Bush, and they are responding as you have taught them to.  If you had any personal honor, each reporter and editor would be insisting on telling the truth — even if it hurts the election chances of your favorite candidate.  Because that’s what honorable people do. Honest people tell the truth even when they don’t like the probable consequences. That’s what honesty means . That’s how trust is earned.  Barack Obama is just another politician, and not a very wise one. He has revealed his ignorance and naivete time after time — and you have swept it under the rug, treated it as nothing.  Meanwhile, you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin, reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter — while you ignored the story of John Edwards’s own adultery for many months.  So I ask you now: Do you have any standards at all? Do you even know what honesty means?  Is getting people to vote for Barack Obama so important that you will throw away everything that journalism is supposed to stand for?  You might want to remember the way the National Organization of Women threw away their integrity by supporting Bill Clinton despite his well-known pattern of sexual exploitation of powerless women. Who listens to NOW anymore?
We know they stand for nothing; they have no principles.  That’s where you are right now.  It’s not too late. You know that if the situation were reversed, and the truth would damage McCain and help Obama, you would be moving heaven and earth to get the true story out there.  If you want to redeem your honor, you will swallow hard and make a list of all the stories you would print if it were McCain who had been getting money from Fannie Mae, McCain whose campaign had consulted with its discredited former CEO, McCain who had voted against tightening its lending practices.  Then you will print them, even though every one of those true stories will point the finger of blame at the reckless Democratic Party, which put our nation’s prosperity at risk so they could feel good about helping the poor, and lay a fair share of the blame at Obama’s door.  You will also tell the truth about John McCain: that he tried, as a Senator, to do what it took to prevent this crisis. You will tell the truth about President Bush: that his administration tried more than once to get Congress to regulate lending in a responsible way.  This was a Congress-caused crisis, beginning during the Clinton administration, with Democrats leading the way into the crisis and blocking every effort to get out of it in a timely fashion.  If you at our local daily newspaper continue to let Americans believe — and vote as if — President Bush and the Republicans caused the crisis, then you are joining in that lie.  If you do not tell the truth about the Democrats — including Barack Obama — and do so with the same energy you would use if the miscreants were Republicans — then you are not journalists by any standard.  You’re just the public relations machine of the Democratic Party, and it’s time you were all fired and real journalists brought in, so that we can actually have a news paper in our city.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/oval-office-redocrated/	President Obama Has Redecorated the Oval Office Middle Eastern Style	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
For a long time, I have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in. The Oval Office is now stripped of the traditional red, white, and blue, and replaced with middle eastern wallpaper, drapes, and decor. The hallway that he walks out of to talk to the press now has middle eastern chairs, drapes, etc.
And the thing that has bothered me the most is the bright yellow drape behind him every time he speaks from the white house. It has Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning.
Today I received this and it clearly shows what I have been noticing. That bright yellow curtain is highly visible, but as you scroll down, you will see what is predominantly absent. Also, as you look at the pictures of other presidents speaking from the same spot, look at the traditional ‘American’ background and decor as opposed to the new decor. Trust me when I say that this is intentional. It should alarm every American.

It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pope-barack-obama/	Catholic Cardinals Considering Barack Obama as Next Pope	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Vatican insiders today report what is an apparent “testing the water” move by the White House to suggest President Barack Obama as a possible replacement for retiring Pope Benedict XVI.
Father Guido Sarducci, unofficial Vatican spokesman, confirmed that a “highly placed person” in the administration had floated the idea of naming Obama the Vicar of Christ on Earth when Pope Benedict steps down at the end of the month.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was quick to state that any talk of the President leaving his current office to assume the duties of the supreme pontiff was irresponsible. “We are quite sure that the President would be able to fulfill the duties of both roles simultaneously,” Carney reassured reporters.
He admitted that, like assuming the mantle of the presidency, becoming pope would entail a step down for the Lightbringer, but in his well-documented humility the President would be willing to do so to set the Church straight on a number of vital issues.
“Internally, the Church needs a thorough reorganization, starting with assigning union representation for each diocese, and also this staunch resistance to the human right of abortion on demand has obviously got to stop,” Carney said.
Furthermore, Carney pointed out the additional advantages of having a Pope Hussein at the helm of the Church..
“Imagine the ecumenical possibilities in the Middle East,” the Press Secretary suggested. “This could be the moment when the Earth begins to heal itself, when the waters start to recede in the relationship between Islam and Christianity.”
Carney invited reporters to consider how a heartfelt apology to the Arab World for the Crusades could open up an entirely new era of interfaith cooperation. While this would of course “require all lands stolen from the Caliphate by Christendom be returned to the Dar-al-Islam,” Carney reminded reporters that the Muslim call to prayer at sunset was one of the sweetest sounds on Earth and that he was sure the Spaniards would welcome back sharia law.
Carney closed the briefing with an emphasis on the historic opportunity this presented to the College of Cardinals. “Imagine, if you will, not only the first African-American pope, but indeed the first non-Catholic pope. I only hope the College of Cardinals can overcome their racism and religious bigotry to make the clear choice.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/palin-whetsell-commentary/	An Alaskan Fishman's Commentary About Governor Sarah Palin	ConfirmedAuthorship!				2015/03/17	" 
The Real Truth About Sarah Palin
 By Dewie Whetsell, Alaskan Fisherman. 
 The last 45 of my 66 years I’ve spent in a commercial fishing town in Alaska. I understand Alaska politics but never understood national politics well until this last year. Here’s the breaking point: Neither side of the Palin controversy gets it. It’s not about persona, style, rhetoric, it’s about doing things. Even Palin supporters never mention the things that I’m about to mention here.
1. Democrats forget when Palin was the Darling of the Democrats, because as soon as Palin took the Governor’s office away from a fellow Republican and tough SOB, Frank Murkowski, she tore into the Republican’s “Corrupt Bastards Club” (CBC) and sent them packing. Many of them are now residing in State housing and wearing orange jump suits The Democratsreacted by skipping around the yard, throwing confetti and singing, “la la la la” (well, you know how they are). Name another governor in this country that has ever done anything similar. 
2. Now with the CBC gone, there were fewer Alaskan politicians to protect the huge, giant oil companies here. So she constructed and enacted a new system of splitting the oil profits called “ACES.” Exxon (the biggest corporation in the world) protested and Sarah told them, “don’t let the door hit you in the stern on your way out.” They stayed, and Alaska residents went from being merely wealthy to being filthy rich. Of course, the other huge international oil companies meekly fell in line. Again, give me the name of any other governor in the country that has done anything similar. 
3. The other thing she did when she walked into the governor’s office is she got the list of State requests for federal funding for projects, known as “pork.” She went through the list, took 85% of them and placed them in the “when-hell-freezes-over” stack. She let locals know that if we need something built, we’ll pay for it ourselves. Maybe she figured she could use the money she got from selling the previous governor’s jet because it was extravagant.
 Maybe she could use the money she saved by dismissing the governor’s cook (remarking that she could cook for her own family), giving back the State vehicle issued to her, maintaining that she already had a car, and dismissing her State provided security force (never mentioning – I imagine – that she’s packing heat herself). I’m still waiting to hear the names of those other governors. 
4. Now, even with her much-ridiculed “gosh and golly” mannerism, she also managed to put together a totally new approach to getting a natural gas pipeline built which will be the biggest private construction project in the history of North America. No one else could do it although they tried. If that doesn’t impress you, then you’re trying too hard to be unimpressed while watching her do things like this while baking up a batch of brownies with her other hand.
 5. For 30 years, Exxon held a lease to do exploratory drilling at a place called Point Thompson. They made excuses the entire time why they couldn’t start drilling. In truth they were holding it like an investment. No governor for 30 years could make them get started. Then, she told them she was revoking their lease and kicking them out. They protested and threatened court action. She shrugged and reminded them that she knew the way to the court house. Alaska won again.
 6. President Obama wants the nation to be on 25% renewable resources for electricity by 2025. Sarah went to the legislature and submitted her plan for Alaska to be at 50% renewable by 2025. We are already at 25%. I can give you more specifics about things done, as opposed to style and persona Everybody wants to be cool, sound cool, look cool. But that’s just a cover-up. I’m still waiting to hear from liberals the names of other governors who can match what mine has done in two and a half years. I won’t be holding my breath.
 By the way, she was content to return to AK after the national election and go to work, but the haters wouldn’t let her. Now these adolescent screechers are obviously not scuba divers. And no one ever told them what happens when you continually jab and pester a barracuda. Without warning, it will spin around and tear your face off. Shoulda known better.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/palin-kilkenny/	Who Is Sarah Palin? by Anne Kilkenny	Truth! But an Opinion!				2015/03/17	"
ABOUT SARAH PALIN 
I am a resident of Wasilla, Alaska. I have known Sarah since 1992. Everyone here knows Sarah, so it is nothing special to say we are on a first-name basis. Our children have attended the same schools. Her father was my child’s favorite substitute teacher. I also am on a first-name basis with her parents and mother-in-law. I attended more City Council meetings during her administration than about 99% of the residents of the city. 
She is enormously popular; in every way she’s like the most popular girl in middle school. Even men who think she is a poor choice and won’t vote for her can’t quit smiling when talking about her because she is a “babe.” 
It is astonishing and almost scary how well she can keep a secret. She kept her most recent pregnancy a secret from her children and parents for seven months. 
She is “pro-life.” She recently gave birth to a Down’s syndrome baby. There is no cover-up involved here; Trig is her baby. 
She is energetic and hardworking. She regularly worked out at the gym. 
She is savvy. She doesn’t take positions; she just “puts things out there” and if they prove to be popular, then she takes credit. 
Her husband works a union job on the North Slope for BP and is a champion snowmobile racer. Todd Palin’s kind of job is highly sought-after because of the schedule and high pay. He arranges his work schedule so he can fish for salmon in Bristol Bay for a month or so in summer, but by no stretch of the imagination is fishing their major source of income. Nor has her lifestyle ever been anything like that of native Alaskans. 
Sarah and her whole family are avid hunters. 
She’s smart. 
Her experience is as mayor of a city with a population of about 5,000 (at the time), and less than two years as governor of a state with about 670,000 residents. 
During her mayoral administration most of the actual work of running this small city was turned over to an administrator. She had been pushed to hire this administrator by party power-brokers after she had gotten herself into some trouble over precipitous firings which had given rise to a recall campaign.  
Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a fiscal conservative. During her six years as Mayor, she increased general government expenditures by over 33%. During those same six years the amount of taxes collected by the City increased by 38%. This was during a period of low inflation (1996-2002). She reduced progressive property taxes and increased a regressive sales tax which taxed even food. The tax cuts that she promoted benefited large corporate property owners way more than they benefited residents. 
The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration weren’t enough to fund everything on her wish list, though, so borrowed money was needed, too. She inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with indebtedness of over $22 million. What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for? Was it the infrastructure that she said she supported? The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked? Or a new library? No. $1 million for a park. $15 million-plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex which she rushed through to build on a piece of property that the City didn’t even have clear title to, and that was still in litigation seven years later — to the delight of the lawyers involved! The sports complex itself is a nice addition to the community but a huge money pit, not the profit-generator she claimed it would be. She also supported bonds for $5.5 million for road projects that could have been done in 5 to 7 years without any borrowing.  
While mayor, City Hall was extensively remodeled and her office redecorated more than once. 
These are small numbers, but Wasilla is a very small city. 
As an oil producer, the high price of oil has created a budget surplus in Alaska. Rather than invest this surplus in technology that will make us energy independent and increase efficiency, as Governor she proposed distribution of this surplus to every individual in the state. 
In this time of record state revenues and budget surpluses, she recommended that the state borrow/bond for road projects, even while she proposed distribution of surplus state revenues: spend today’s surplus, borrow for needs. 
She’s not very tolerant of divergent opinions or open to outside ideas or compromise. As mayor, she fought ideas that weren’t generated by her or her staff. Ideas weren’t evaluated on their merits, but on the basis of who proposed them.  
While Sarah was mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed. City residents rallied to the defense of the City Librarian and against Palin’s attempt at out-and-out censorship, so Palin backed down and withdrew her termination letter. People who fought her attempt to oust the Librarian are on her enemies list to this day. 
Sarah complained about the old boy’s club when she first ran for mayor, so what did she bring Wasilla? A new set of “old boys.” Palin fired most of the experienced staff she inherited. At the City and as Governor she hired or elevated new, inexperienced, obscure people, creating a staff totally dependent on her for their jobs and eternally grateful and fiercely loyal — loyal to the point of abusing their power to further her personal agenda, as she has acknowledged happened in the case of pressuring the state’s top cop (see below). 
As mayor, Sarah fired Wasilla’s police chief because he intimidated her, she told the press. As governor, her recent firing of Alaska’s top cop has the ring of familiarity about it. He served at her pleasure and she had every legal right to fire him, but it’s pretty clear that an important factor in her decision to fire him was because he wouldn’t fire her sister’s ex-husband, a state trooper. Under investigation for abuse of power, she has had to admit that more than two dozen contacts were made between her staff and=2 0family to the person that she later fired, pressuring him to fire her ex-brother-in-law. She tried to replace the man she fired with a man who she knew had been reprimanded for sexual harassment; when this caused a public furor, she withdrew her support. 
She has bitten the hand of every person who extended theirs to her in help. The city councilperson who personally escorted her around town introducing her to voters when she first ran for Wasilla City Council became one of her first targets when she was later elected mayor.She abruptly fired her loyal City Administrator; even people who didn’t like the guy were stunned by this ruthlessness. 
Fear of retribution has kept all of these people from saying anything publicly about her. 
When then-Governor Murkowski was handing out political plums, Sarah got the best, chair of the Alaska Oil and Gas
Conservation Commission: one of the few jobs not in Juneau and one of the best paid. She had no background in oil and gas issues. Within months of scoring this great job which paid $122,400/year, she was complaining in the press about the high salary. I was told that she hated that job: the commute, the structured hours, the work. Sarah became aware that a member of this commission (who was also the state chair of the Republican Party) had engaged in unethical behavior on the job. In a gutsy move which some undoubtedly cautioned her could be political suicide, Sarah solved all her problems in one fell swoop: got out=2 0of the job she hated and garnered gobs of media attention as the patron saint of ethics and as a gutsy fighter against the old boys club when she dramatically quit, exposing this man’s ethics violations (for which he was fined). 
As mayor, she had her hand stuck out as far as anyone for pork from Senator Ted Stevens. Lately, she has castigated his pork-barrel politics and publicly humiliated him. She only opposed the bridge to nowhere after it became clear that it would be unwise not to. 
As governor, she gave the legislature no direction and budget guidelines, then made a big grandstand display of line-item vetoing projects, calling them pork. Public outcry and further legislative action restored most of these projects — which had been vetoed simply because she was not aware of their importance — but with the unobservant she had gained a reputation as anti-pork.  
She is solidly Republican: no political maverick. The state party leaders hate her because she has bit them in the back and humiliated them. Other members of the party object to her self-description as a fiscal conservative. 
Around Wasilla there are people who went to high school with Sarah. They call her Sarah Barracuda because of her unbridled ambition and predatory ruthlessness. Before she became so powerful, very ugly stories circulated around town about shenanigans she pulled to be made point guard on the high school basketball team. When Sarah’s mother-in-law, a highly respected member of the community and experienced manager, ran for mayor, Sarah refused to endorse her. 
As governor, she stepped outside of the box and put together of package of legislation known as AGIA that forced the oil companies to march to the beat of her drum. 
Like most Alaskans, she favors drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. She has questioned if the loss of sea ice is linked to global warming. She campaigned as a private citizen against a state initiative that would have either a) protected salmon streams from pollution from mines, or b) tied up in the courts all mining in the state (depending on who you listen to). She has pushed the state’s lawsuit against the Dept. of the Interior’s decision to list polar bears as threatened species. 
McCain is the oldest person to ever run for president; Sarah will be a heartbeat away from being president. 
There have to be literally millions of Americans who are more knowledgeable and experienced than she.  
However, there are a lot of people who have underestimated her and are regretting it. 
WHY AM I WRITING THIS? 
First, I have long believed in the importance of being an informed voter. I am a voter registrar. For 10 years I put on student voting programs in the schools. If you Google my name (Anne Kilkenny + Alaska), you will find references to my participation in local government, education, and PTA/parent organizations. 
Second, I’ve alwa ys operated in the belief that “Bad things happen when good people stay silent.” Few people know as much as I do because few have gone to as many City Council meetings. 
Third, I am just a housewife. I don’t have a job she can bump me out of. I don’t belong to any organization that she can hurt. But I am no fool; she is immensely popular here, and it is likely that this will cost me somehow in the future: that’s life. 
Fourth, she has hated me since back in 1996, when I was one of the 100 or so people who rallied to support the City Librarian against Sarah’s attempt at censorship. 
Fifth, I looked around and realized that everybody else was afraid to say anything because they were somehow vulnerable. 
CAVEATS I am not a statistician. I developed the numbers for the increase in spending and taxation two years ago (when Palin was running for governor) from information supplied to me by the finance director of the City of Wasilla, and I can’t recall exactly what I adjusted for: did I adjust for inflation? for population increases? Right now, it is impossible for a private person to get any info out of City Hall — they are swamped. So I can’t verify my numbers. 
You may have noticed that there are various numbers circulating for the population of Wasilla, ranging from my “about 5,000” up to 9,000.The day Palin’s selection was announced a city official told me that the current population is about 7,000. The=2 0official 2000 census count was 5,460. I have used about 5,000 because Palin was mayor from 1996 to 2002, and the city was growing rapidly in the mid-90s.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/oklahoma-illinois/	Claims About Illinois and Oklahoma	Truth! & Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Illinois & Oklahoma

The first part about Illinois and the second part about Oklahoma. It makes for an interesting contrast ..
PART 1 — Illinois
“A State with No Republicans!”
Some interesting data on the ‘state’ of, the State of Illinois … There are more people on welfare in Illinois than there are people working.
Chicago pays the highest wages to teachers than anywhere else in the U.S.. Their average pay is $110,000/year.
Their pensions average 80-90% of their income.
Wow, are Illinois and Chicago great or what?
Be sure to read till the end.
I’ve never heard it explained better.
Perhaps the U.S. should pull out of Chicago?
Body count:
In six months, 292 killed (murdered) in Chicago ..
221 killed in Iraq; AND Chicago has one of the strictest gun laws in
the entire US.
Here’s the Chicago chain of command:
President: Barack Hussein Obama •
Senator: Dick Durbin •
House Representative: Jesse Jackson Jr. •
Governor: Pat Quinn •
House leader: Mike Madigan •
Atty. Gen.: Lisa Madigan (daughter of Mike) •
Mayor: Rahm Emanuel •
The leadership in Illinois – all Democrats. •
Thank you for the combat zone in Chicago. •
Of course, they’re all blaming each other. •
Can’t blame Republicans; there aren’t any! •
Let us get ALL the facts out while we are at it:
Chicago school system rated one of the worst in the country.
Can’t blame Republicans; there aren’t any!
State pension fund $78 Billion in debt, worst in country.
Can’t blame Republicans; there aren’t any!
Cook County ( Chicago ) sales tax 10.25% highest in country.
Can’t blame Republicans; there aren’t any!
This is the political culture that Obama comes from in Illinois ..
And he is going to ‘fix’ Washington politics for us?
George Ryan is no longer Governor, he is in prison.
He was replaced by Rob Blagojevich who is, by the way, also in prison.
And Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned, .. and, that’s right, he
and his wife are both in prison.
The Land of Lincoln, where our Governors and Representatives make our license plates. What?
As long as they keep providing entitlements to the population of Chicago, nothing is going to change, except the state will go bankrupt before the country does.
“Anybody who thinks he can be happy and prosperous by letting the Government take care of him better take a closer look at the American Indian.”
Don’t forget Detroit, another great example of a Democratic empire…
With all the bad news, there is hope, so let’s go to:
PART 2— Oklahoma
OKLAHOMA- may soon have plenty of new residents!
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING, AND TRUE …. PLEASE READ IT!
Oklahoma is the only state that Obama did not win even one county in the last election… While everyone is focusing on Arizona’s new law, look what Oklahoma has been doing!!!
An update from Oklahoma :
Oklahoma law passed, 37 to 9 an amendment to place the Ten Commandments on the front entrance to the state capitol. The feds in D.C., along with the ACLU, said it would be a mistake. Hey this is a conservative state, based on Christian values… HB1330
Guess what… Oklahoma did it anyway.
Oklahoma recently passed a law in the state to incarcerate all illegal
immigrants and ship them back to where they came from unless they want to get a green card and become an American citizen. They all scattered. HB1804.
This was against the advice of the Federal Government, and the ACLU,
they said it would be a mistake.
Guess what… Oklahoma did it anyway.
Recently Oklahoma passed a law to include DNA samples from any and all illegal’s to the Oklahoma database, for criminal investigative purposes. Pelosi said it was unconstitutional SB1102
Guess what… Oklahoma did it anyway.
Several weeks ago, we passed a law, declaring Oklahoma as a Sovereign state, not under the Federal Government directives. Joining, Texas, Montana and Utah as the only states to do so.
More states are likely to follow: Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Carolinas, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, West Virginia, Mississippi and Florida …
Save your confederate money, it appears the South is about to rise up once again. HJR 1003
The federal Government has made bold steps to take away our guns. Oklahoma, a week ago, passed a law confirming people in this state have the right to bear arms and transport them in their vehicles. I’m sure that was a setback for the criminals The Liberals didn’t like it — But….
Guess what… Oklahoma did it anyway.
Recently, the state has voted and passed a law that ALL drivers’ license exams will be printed in English and only English and no other language. They have been called racist for doing this, but the fact is that ALL of the road signs are in English only. If you want to drive in Oklahoma, you must read and write English. Really simple. By the way, the Liberals don’t like any of this either.
Guess what… who cares… Oklahoma is doing it anyway.
If you like it, pass it on, if you don’t then delete it… Thanks
Guess what: the people I’m sending this to, will send it on.
Well, at least the ones who love and believe in freedom will.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/olmertspeech/	Bold Speech Given By Ehud Olmert about Israel and Hezobollah?	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"  
 If you have not had access to this speech, it is one of the most riveting presentations I have ever read. 
 
 July 31, 2006  Ladies and gentlemen, leaders of the world. I, the Prime Minister of Israel,  am speaking to you from Jerusalem in the face of the terrible pictures from Kfar Kana. Any human heart, wherever it is, must sicken and recoil at the sight of such pictures. There are no words of comfort that can mitigate the enormity of this tragedy. Still, I am looking you straight in the eye and telling you that the State of Israel will continue its military campaign in Lebanon.
 The Israel Defense Forces will continue to attack targets from which missiles and Katyusha rockets are fired at hospitals, old age homes and kindergartens in Israel. I have instructed the security forces and the IDF to continue to hunt for the Katyusha stockpiles and launch sites from which these savages are bombarding the State of Israel.
  We will not hesitate, we will not apologize and we will not back off.  If they continue to launch missiles into Israel from Kfar Kana, we will continue to bomb Kfar Kana. Today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.  Here, there and everywhere. The children of Kfar Kana could now be sleeping peacefully in their homes, unmolested, had the agents of the devil not taken over their land and turned the lives of our children into hell.
  Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time you understood: the Jewish state will no longer be trampled upon. We will no longer allow anyone to exploit population centers in order to bomb our citizens. No one will be able to hide anymore behind women and children in order to kill our women and children. This anarchy is over. You can condemn us, you can boycott us, you can stop visiting us and, if necessary, we will stop visiting you.
 A voice for six million citizens, today I am serving as the voice of six million bombarded Israeli citizens who serve as the voice of six million murdered Jews who were melted down to dust and ashes by savages in Europe. In both cases, those responsible for these evil acts were, and are, barbarians devoid of all humanity, who set themselves one simple goal: to wipe the Jewish race off the face of the earth, as Adolph Hitler said, or to wipe the State of Israel off the map, as Mahmoud Ahmedinjad proclaims.
 And you – just as you did not take those words seriously then, you are ignoring them again now. And that, ladies and gentlemen, leaders of the world, will not happen again. Never again will we wait for bombs that never came to hit the gas chambers. Never again will we wait for salvation that never arrives. Now we have our own air force. The Jewish people are now capable of standing up to those who seek their destruction – those people will no longer be able to hide behind women and children. They will no longer be able to evade their responsibility.
  Every place from which a Katyusha is fired into the State of Israel will be a legitimate target for us to attack. This must be stated clearly and publicly, once and for all. You are welcome to judge us, to ostracize us, to boycott us and to vilify us. But to kill us? Absolutely not.
  Four months ago I was elected by hundreds of thousands of citizens to the office of Prime Minister of the government of Israel, on the basis of my plan for unilaterally withdrawing from 90 percent of the areas of Judea and Samaria, the birth place and cradle of the Jewish people; to end most of the occupation and to enable the Palestinian people to turn over a new leaf and to calm things down until conditions are ripe for attaining a permanent settlement between us.
  The Prime Minister who preceded me, Ariel Sharon, made a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip back to the international border, and gave the Palestinians there a chance to build a new reality for themselves. The Prime Minister who preceded him, Ehud Barak, ended the lengthy Israeli presence in Lebanon and pulled the IDF back to the international border, leaving the land of the cedars to flourish, develop and establish its democracy and its economy.
  What did the State of Israel get in exchange for all of this? Did we win even one minute of quiet? Was our hand, outstretched in peace, met with a handshake of encouragement? Ehud Barak’s peace initiative at Camp David let loose on us a wave of suicide bombers who smashed and blew to pieces over 1,000 citizens, men, women and children. I don’t remember you being so enraged then. Maybe that happened because we did not allow TV close-ups of the dismembered body parts of the Israeli youngsters at the Dolphinarium? Or of the shattered lives of the people butchered while celebrating the Passover seder at the Park Hotel in Netanya? What can you do – that’s the way we are. We don’t wave body parts at the camera. We grieve quietly.
 We do not dance on the roofs at the sight of the bodies of our enemy’s children – we express genuine sorrow and regret. That is the monstrous behavior of our enemies. Now they have risen up against us. Tomorrow they will rise up against you. You are already familiar with the murderous taste of this terror. And you will taste more.
  And Ariel Sharon’s withdrawal from Gaza. What did it get us? A barrage of Kassem missiles fired at peaceful settlements and the kidnapping of soldiers. Then too, I don’t recall you reacting with such alarm. And for six years, the withdrawal from Lebanon has drawn the vituperation and crimes of a dangerous, extremist Iranian agent, who took over an entire country in the name of religious fanaticism and is trying to take Israel hostage on his way to Jerusalem – and from there to Paris and London.
  An enormous terrorist infrastructure has been established by Iran on our border, threatening our citizens, growing stronger before our very eyes, awaiting the moment when the land of the Ayatollahs becomes a nuclear power in order to bring us to our knees. And make no mistake – we won’t go down alone. You, the leaders of the free and enlightened world, will go down along with us.
  So today, here and now, I am putting an end to this parade of hypocrisy. I don’t recall such a wave of reaction in the face of the 100 citizens killed every single day in Iraq. Sunnis kill Shiites who kill Sunnis, and all of them kill Americans – and the world remains silent. And I am hard pressed to recall a similar reaction when the Russians destroyed entire villages and burned down large cities in order to repress the revolt in Chechnya.  And when NATO bombed Kosovo for almost three months and c
rushed the civilian population – then you also kept silent. What is it about us, the Jews, the minority, the persecuted, that arouses this cosmic sense of justice in you?  What do we have that all the others don’t?
  In a loud clear voice, looking you straight in the eye, I stand before you openly and I will not apologize. I will not capitulate. I will not whine.  This is a battle for our freedom. For our humanity. For the right to lead normal lives within our recognized, legitimate borders. It is also your battle. I pray and I believe that now you will understand that.  Because if you don’t, you may regret it later, when it’s too late.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/michael-reagan-butler-092113/	Michael Reagan’s Article About “The Butler”	Truth!  & Fiction! 				2015/03/17	"This is the movie review by Ronald Reagan’s son. No Hollywood sugar coating here…


The Butler
There you go again, Hollywood.
You’ve taken a great story about a real person and real events and twisted it into a bunch of lies.
You took the true story of Eugene Allen, the White House butler who served eight presidents from 1952 to 1986, and turned it into a clichéd “message movie.”
“Lee Daniels’ The Butler’” stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines, a fictional character supposedly based on Eugene Allen’s real life.
But let’s compare the two White House butlers.
Guess which one grew up in segregated Virginia, got a job at the White House and rose to become maître d’hôtel, the highest position in White House service?
Guess which one had a happy, quiet life and was married to the same woman for 65 years? And who had one son who served honorably in Vietnam and never made a peep of protest through the pre- and post-civil rights era?
Now guess which butler grew up on a Georgia farm, watched the boss rape his mother and then, when his father protested the rape, watched the boss put a bullet through his father’s head?
Guess which butler feels the pain of America’s racial injustices so deeply that he quits his White House job and joins his son in a protest movement?
And guess which butler has a wife (Oprah Winfrey) who becomes an alcoholic and has a cheap affair with the guy next door? (I’m surprised it wasn’t the vice president.)
After comparing Hollywood’s absurd version of Eugene Allen’s life story with the truth, you wonder why the producers didn’t just call it “The Butler from Another Planet.”
Screenwriter Danny Strong says he was trying to present a “backstage kind of view of the White House” that portrayed presidents and first ladies as they really were in everyday life.
Well, I was backstage at the White House — a few hundred times. I met and knew the real butler, Mr. Allen, and I knew a little about my father.
Portraying Ronald Reagan as a racist because he was in favor of lifting economic sanctions against South Africa is simplistic and dishonest.
If you knew my father, you’d know he was the last person on Earth you would call a racist.
If Strong had gotten his “facts” from the Reagan biographies, he’d have learned that when my father was playing football at Eureka College one of his best friends was a black teammate.
Strong also would have learned that my father invited black players home for dinner and once, when two players were not allowed to stay in the local hotel, he invited them to stay overnight at his house.
Screenwriter Strong also might have found out that when my father was governor of California he appointed more blacks to positions of power than any of predecessors — combined.
It’s appalling to me that someone is trying to imply my father was a racist. He and Nancy and the rest of the Reagan family treated Mr. Allen with the utmost respect.
It was Nancy Reagan who invited the butler to dinner – not to work but as guest. And it was my father who promoted Mr. Allen to maître d’hôtel.
The real story of the White House butler doesn’t imply racism at all. It’s simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there.
My father’s position on lifting the South African sanctions in the ‘80s had nothing to do with the narrow issue of race. It had to do with the geopolitics of the Cold War.
But facts don’t matter to Hollywood’s creative propagandists. Truth is too complicated and not dramatic enough for scriptwriters, who think in minute terms, not the big picture, when it comes to a conservative.
Despite what Hollywood’s liberal hacks believe, my father didn’t see people in colors. He saw them as individual Americans. If the liberals in Hollywood — and Washington — ever start looking at people the way he did, the country will be a lot better off.






Jane Fonda (better known as Hanoi Jane by those my age) playing Nancy Reagan is an outrage, and an insult to all of us that served in Viet Nam!
Send this to your friends and children too young to know about this Traitor…


BOYCOTT “THE BUTLER” AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS TRAITOR
BOYCOTT THIS MOVIE
What a disgrace to Mrs. Nancy Reagan! Boycott this movie!
America we must not forget
JANE FONDA as NANCY REAGAN?
This cannot go around too much. Those of us that were living
in those years will never forget that she was a traitor and did
a lot of damage to our boys.
She has now been chosen to play Nancy Reagan in her life story.
I am sending this one out because so many do not know this truth…and
also because she was on 3 times this week talking about her new book…
And how good she feels in her 70’s. She still does not know what she
did wrong. Her book just may not make the best seller list if more people knew…
also…
Barbara Walters said:
Thank you all. Many died in Vietnam for our freedoms. I did not like
Jane Fonda then and I don’t like her now.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/rush-transcript-family/	Family with Down Syndrome Child Meets John McCain and Sarah Palin	Truth!				2015/03/17	"This comes from a caller to Rush Limbaugh. Before you liberals can puke, you might just read this. It is nice story no matter who you hate.

 
 
Great story & photos!
 
RUSH: Kurt in Pittsburgh , hello, sir. Nice to have you on the EIB Network, and how
about the Steelers defense?
 
CALLER: How about those Steelers, huh?
 
RUSH: How about that?
 
CALLER: Hey, listen, Rush, longtime listener, first-time caller, one of those Bible, family, gun clingers from
western Pennsylvania .
 
RUSH: Thank you.
 
CALLER: And I wanted to share a story with you. A week ago last Saturday we went to the Palin-McCain
rally in Washington , Pennsylvania , was the day after he announced her, and we have a five-year-old daughter
with Down syndrome, and we made a sign that said: “We Love Kids with Down Syndrome.” So when they
pulled in in their bus the sign did catch their, McCain and Palin and the rest of their family, it caught their eye,
we could tell, they gave us a thumbs-up from the bus, so we were all excited just by that —
 
RUSH: Wait, wait, wait. Who gave you the thumbs up, McCain and Palin?
 
CALLER: McCain, Palin, Cindy McCain, we could see them from the bus. We were in a position where we
had eye contact with them —
 
RUSH: Oh, cool!
 
CALLER: My wife was holding our daughter.
 
RUSH: Very, very, very cool
 
CALLER: It was really cool, Rush. I was like, “Wow, that’s awesome,” because I love Governor Palin and so
I thought that’s really neat. So then we moved around as the bus was getting ready to pull out, we kind of
positioned ourselves so we could just wave them on and a Secret Service agent came .up to us and said,
“Hey, can you come with us?” I was like, “Do we have a choice?”
 
RUSH: (laughing) You shouldn’t have worried. It’s not the Clinton administration.
 
CALLER: Right. So we accompanied them up the hill, we went right to the bus, where it was, and Governor
Palin, Senator McCain, Cindy, Todd Palin, they’re all standing there. We’re in this inner circle with just us and
them, and the Secret Service agent, and they came right up to us and thanked us for coming out, said they
loved our sign, and Governor Palin immediately said, “May I hold your daughter?” and our daughter Chloe,
who’s five, went right to her, and I have some pictures I’d love to send you maybe when I’m done here,
but Governor Palin was hugging Chloe, and then her little daughter brought their baby Trig who has Down
syndrome from the bus, he was napping, and Chloe went right over and kissed him on the cheek, and my
son Nolan who’s nine, he thanked her.
 
RUSH: This is amazing.
 
CALLER: I will send you all the stuff, Senator McCain was talking to my son, and we thanked him for his
service, and he asked my son if he wanted to see the bus, and we were hanging out and it was very surreal.
I felt like we could have had a pizza and a beer with them, they were so warm.
 
RUSH: You know what? I want to put you on hold I want Snerdley to give you our super-secret, known-only-
to-three-people here, e-mail address.
 
CALLER: I will send you everything, Rush.
 
RUSH: And then could you send us these pictures? Would you mind if we put them on the website?
 
CALLER: I would be honored, and my main thing is they are warm, kind, genuine people, and they represent
the best of this country.
 
RUSH: That’s right. And when you send these pictures, make sure you identify them I mean, we’ll know
Palin and McCain, of course. Identify yourselves.
 
CALLER: I will, I will identify everybody in the picture, Rush, and God bless you for being a beacon of hope
and truth in this country.
 
RUSH: Oh, no, no. It’s nothing, it’s nothing. You’re doing the Lord’s work.
 
CALLER: Well, we’re very blessed and I want people to know what a blessing it is to have a child with Down
syndrome. These kids, they’re angels.
 
RUSH: That’s the thing. There’s always good to be found in everything that happens. It may be a while before
it reveals itself.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/root-obama-brilliant/	Obama is Overwhelming the Economy to Destroy Capitalism in the U.S.	Commentary!				2015/03/17	" Please… This is a must read, even if you disagree, as the is a pivotal point for our country. Once this transformation is complete, it will be impossible to reverse and I think you will find that you don’t like it. But by then, it will be too late. This is our future!
WAYNE ALLYN ROOT: Overwhelm the system
 Barach Obama is no fool. He is not incompetent. To the contrary, he is brilliant. He knows exactly what he’s doing. He is purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos — thereby destroying capitalism and our country from within. 
Barack Obama is my college classmate ( Columbia University , class of ’83). As Glenn Beck correctly predicted from day one, Obama is following the plan of Cloward & Piven, two professors at Columbia University . They outlined a plan to socialize America by overwhelming the system with government spending and entitlement demands. Add up the clues below. Taken individually they’re alarming. Taken as a whole, it is a brilliant, Machiavellian game plan to turn the United States into a socialist/Marxist state with a permanent majority that desperately needs government for survival … and can be counted on to always vote for bigger government. Why not? They have no responsibility to pay for it. 
— Universal health care. The health care bill had very little to do with health care. It had everything to do with unionizing millions of hospital and health care workers, as well as adding 15,000 to 20,000 new IRS agents (who will join government employee unions). Obama doesn’t care that giving free health care to 30 million Americans will add trillions to the national debt. What he does care about is that it cements the dependence of those 30 million voters to Democrats and big government. Who but a socialist revolutionary would pass this reckless spending bill in the middle of a depression?  
— Cap and trade. Like health care legislation having nothing to do with health care, cap and trade has nothing to do with global warming. It has everything to do with redistribution of income, government control of the economy and a criminal payoff to Obama’s biggest contributors. Those powerful and wealthy unions and contributors (like GE, which owns NBC, MSNBC and CNBC) can then be counted on to support everything Obama wants. They will kick-back hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions to Obama and the Democratic Party to keep them in power. The bonus is that all the new taxes on Americans with bigger cars, bigger homes and businesses helps Obama “spread the wealth around.” 
— Make Puerto Rico a state. Why? Who’s asking for a 51st state? Who’s asking for millions of new welfare recipients and government entitlement addicts in the middle of a depression? Certainly not American taxpayers. But this has been Obama’s plan all along. His goal is to add two new Democrat senators, five Democrat congressman and a million loyal Democratic voters who are dependent on big government. 
— Legalize 12 million illegal immigrants. Just giving these 12 million potential new citizens free health care alone could overwhelm the system and bankrupt America . But it adds 12 million reliable new Democrat voters who can be counted on to support big government. Add another few trillion dollars in welfare, aid to dependent children, food stamps, free medical, education, tax credits for the poor, and eventually Social Security. 
— Stimulus and bailouts. Where did all that money go? It went to Democrat contributors, organizations (ACORN), and unions — including billions of dollars to save or create jobs of government employees across the country. It went to save GM and Chrysler so that their employees could keep paying union dues. It went to AIG so that Goldman Sachs could be bailed out (after giving Obama almost $1 million in contributions). A staggering $125 billion went to teachers (thereby protecting their union dues). All those public employees will vote loyally Democrat to protect their bloated salaries and pensions that are bankrupting America . The country goes broke, future generations face a bleak future, but Obama, the Democrat Party, government, and the unions grow more powerful. The ends justify the means. 
— Raise taxes on small business owners, high-income earners, and job creators. Put the entire burden on only the top 20 percent of taxpayers, redistribute the income, punish success, and reward those who did nothing to deserve it (except vote for Obama). Reagan wanted to dramatically cut taxes in order to starve the government. Obama wants to dramatically raise taxes to starve his political opposition. 
With the acts outlined above, Obama and his regime have created a vast and rapidly expanding constituency of voters dependent on big government; a vast privileged class of public employees who work for big government; and a government dedicated to destroying capitalism and installing themselves as socialist rulers by overwhelming the system. 
Add it up and you’ve got the perfect Marxist scheme — all devised by my Columbia University college classmate Barack Obama using the Cloward and Piven Plan.

My niece, Katelyn, stationed at Baluud , Iraq was assigned, with others of her detachment, to be escort/guard/ watcher for Martha Raddatz of ABC News as she covered John McCain’s recent trip to Iraq . Katelyn and her Captain stood directly behind Raddatz as she queried GI’s walking past. They kept count of the GI’s and you should remember these numbers. She asked 60 GI’s who they planned to vote for in November. 54 said John McCain, 4 for Obama and 2 for Hillary. Katelyn called home and told her Mom and Dad to watch ABC news the next night because she was standing directly behind Raddatz and maybe they’d see her on TV. Mom and Dad of course, called and emailed all the kinfolk to watch the newscast and maybe see Katelyn. Well, of course, we all watched and what we saw wasn’t a glimpse of Katelyn, but got a hell’ uva view of skewed news. After a dissertation on McCain’s trip and speech, ABC showed 5 GI’s being asked by Raddatz how they were going to vote in November; 3 for Obama and 2 for Clinton . No mention of the 54 for McCain.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/welcome-back-dad/	"Michael Reagan's Article Saying ""Welcome Back Dad!"""	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
September 04, 2008  Welcome Back, Dad  By Michael Reagan   I’ve been trying to convince my fellow conservatives that they have been wasting their time in a fruitless quest for a new Ronald Reagan to emerge and lead our party and our nation. I insisted that we’d never see his like again because he was one of a kind.   I was wrong!   Wednesday night I watched the Republican National Convention on television and there, before my very eyes, I saw my Dad reborn; only this time he’s a she.   And what a she!   In one blockbuster of a speech, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin resurrected my Dad’s indomitable spirit and sent it soaring above the convention center, shooting shock waves through the cynical media’s assigned spaces and electrifying the huge audience with the kind of inspiring rhetoric we haven’t heard since my Dad left the scene.   This was Ronald Reagan at his best — the same Ronald Reagan who made the address known now solely as “The Speech,” which during the Goldwater campaign set the tone and the agenda for the rebirth of the traditional conservative movement that later sent him to the White House for eight years and revived the moribund GOP.   Last night was an extraordinary event. Widely seen beforehand as a make-or-break effort — either an opportunity for Sarah Palin to show that she was the happy warrior that John McCain assured us she was, or a disaster that would dash McCain’s presidential hopes and send her back to Alaska, sadder but wiser.   Obviously un-intimidated by either the savage onslaught to which the left-leaning media had subjected her, or the incredible challenge she faced — and oozing with confidence — she strode defiantly to the podium and proved she was everything and even more than John McCain told us.   Much has been made of the fact that she is a woman. What we saw last night, however, was something much more than a just a woman accomplishing something no Republican woman has ever achieved. What we saw was a red-blooded American with that rare, God-given ability to rally her dispirited fellow Republicans and take up the daunting task of leading them — and all her fellow Americans — on a pilgrimage to that shining city on the hill my father envisioned as our nation’s real destination.   In a few words she managed to rip the mask from the faces of her Democratic rivals and reveal them for what they are — a pair of old-fashioned liberals making promises that cannot be kept without bankrupting the nation and reducing most Americans to the status of mendicants begging for their daily bread at the feet of an all-powerful government.   Most important, by comparing her own stunning record of achievement with his, she showed Barack Obama for the sham that he is, a man without any solid accomplishments beyond conspicuous self-aggrandizement.   Like Ronald Reagan, Sarah Palin is one of us. She knows how most of us live because that’s the way she lives. She shares our homespun values and our beliefs, and she glories in her status as a small-town woman who put her shoulder to the wheel and made life better for her neighbors.   Her astonishing rise up from the grass-roots, her total lack of self-importance, and her ordinary American values and modest lifestyle reveal her to be the kind of hard-working, optimistic, ordinary American who made this country the greatest, most powerful nation on the face of the earth.   As hard as you might try, you won’t find that kind of plain-spoken, down-to-earth, self-reliant American in the upper ranks of the liberal-infested, elitist Democratic Party, or in the Obama campaign.   Sarah Palin didn’t go to Harvard, or fiddle around in urban neighborhood leftist activism while engaging in opportunism within the ranks of one of the nation’s most corrupt political machines, never challenging it and going along to get along, like Barack Obama.   Instead she took on the corrupt establishment in Alaska and beat it, rising to the governorship while bringing reforms to every level of government she served in on her way up the ladder.   Welcome back, Dad, even if you’re wearing a dress and bearing children this time around.

MAYOR REFUSES TO REMOVE PORK FROM SCHOOL CANTEEN- MENU… EXPLAINS WHY
Muslim parents demanded the abolition of pork in all the school canteens of a Montreal suburb.
The mayor of the Montreal suburb of Dorval has refused, and the town clerk sent a note to all parents to explain why…
“Muslims must understand that they have to adapt to Canada and Quebec, its customs, its traditions, its way of life, because that’s where they chose to immigrate.
“They must understand that they have to integrate and learn to live in Quebec.
“They must understand that it is for them to change their lifestyle, not the Canadians who so generously welcomed them.
“They must understand that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic; they accepted many immigrants before Muslims (whereas the reverse is not true, in that Muslim states do not accept non-Muslim immigrants).
“That no more than other nations, Canadians are not willing to give up their identity, their culture.
“And if Canada is a land of welcome, it’s not the Mayor of Dorval who welcomes foreigners, but the Canadian-Quebecois people as a whole.
“Finally, they must understand that in Canada (Quebec) with its Judeo-Christian roots, Christmas trees, churches and religious festivals, religion must remain in the private domain.
The municipality of Dorval was right to refuse any concessions to Islam and Sharia.
“For Muslims who disagree with secularism and do not feel comfortable in Canada, there are 57 beautiful Muslim countries in the world, most of them under-populated and ready to receive them with open halal arms in accordance with Shariah.
“If you left your country for Canada, and not for other Muslim countries, it is because you have considered that life is better in Canada than elsewhere.
“Ask yourself the question, just once, “Why is it better here in Canada than where you come from?”
“A canteen with pork is part of the answer.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/remus-reid/	Harry Reid’s HorseThief Ancestor	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Judy Wallman, a professional genealogy researcher here in southern California, was doing some personal work on her own family tree. She discovered that Harry Reid’s great-great uncle, Remus Reid, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889. Both Judy and Harry Reid share this common ancestor.

Harry Reid 
 

The only known photograph of Remus shows him standing on the gallows in Montana territory. 
On the back of the picture Judy obtained during her research is this inscription: ‘Remus Reid, horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.’
So Judy recently e-mailed Congressman Harry Reid for information about their great-great uncle.
Believe it or not, Harry Reid’s staff sent back the following biographical sketch for her genealogy research:
‘Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.’
NOW THAT is how it’s done folks! That’s real SPIN.

HEY HE LIVES IN THE LAND OF FRUITS AND NUTS. THEY ARE GOING BROKE FASTER THAN THE USA AND THEY ARE ALL LIBERALS.. WELL SAVE A FEW.
Don Rickles Roasts the Dems…






Hello, dummies! Oh my God, look at you. Anyone else hurt in the accident?
Seriously, Senator Reid has a face of a Saint – A Saint Bernard
Now I know why they call you the arithmetic man You add partisanship, subtract pleasure, divide attention, and multiply ignorance.
Reid is so physically unimposing, he makes Pee Wee Herman look like Mr. T. And Reid’s so dumb, he makes Speaker Pelosi look like an intellectual. Nevada is soooo screwed! If I were less polite, I’d say Reid makes Kevin Federline look successful.
Speaking of the Speaker… Nancy Pelosi, hubba, hubba! Hey baby, you must’ve been something before electricity.
Seriously, the Speaker may look like an idiot and talk like an idiot but don’t let that fool you. She really is an idiot.
Madame Speaker… want to make twelve bucks the hard way? Pelosi says she’s not partisan, but her constituents call her Madame Pelossilini.
Charlie Rangel… still alive and still robbing the taxpayers blind What does that make, six decades of theft?
Rangel’s the only man with a rent-controlled mansion He’s the guy who writes our tax laws but forgot to pay taxes on $75 grand in rental income! So why isn’t he the Treasury Secretary? Rangel runs more scams than a Nigerian Banker.
Barney Frank – he’s a better actor than Fred Flintstone. Consider… he and Dodd caused the whole financial meltdown and they’re not only not serving time with Bubba and Rodney, they’re still heading up the financial system!
Let’s all admit it… Barney Frank slobbers more than a sheepdog on Novocain.. How did this guy get elected? Oh, that’s right.. he’s from Massachusetts . That’s the state that elects Mr. Charisma, John Kerry — man of the people!
You know, if Senator Dodd were any more crooked, you could open wine bottles with him.
Here’s a news flash, Dodd: when your local newspaper calls you a “lying weasel”, it may be time to retire.
Dodd’s involved in more shady deals than the Clintons . Even Rangel looks u p to him!
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, I really respect you.. especially given your upbringing. All you’ve overcome…. I heard your birth certificate is an apology from the condom factory. I don’t know what makes you so dumb, but it really works for you. Personally, I don’t think you’re a fool, but what’s my opinion compared to that of thousands of others?
As for President Obama, what can I say? They say President Obama’s arrogant and aloof, but I don’t agree.
Now it’s true when you enter the room, you have to kiss his ring. I don’t mind, but he has it in his back pocket.
His mind is open to new ideas — so open that ideas simply pass through it.
Obama lies so much, I was actually surprised to find out his first name really was Barack.
Just don’t ask about his middle name! But Obama was able to set a record… he actually lied more in 60 days than Bill Clinton
FOR THOSE THAT VOTED FOR “HOPE AND CHANGE”..  BEND OVER AND PREPARE TO RECEIVE YOUR BOUNTY!
President Obama just completed the UNHOLY and ANTI-AMERICAN TRIFECTA:
1st president in 110 years to miss the annual Army-Navy Football Game
1st president to not attend any Christmas religious observance.
1st president to stay on vacation after a terrorist attack.
AND ALL IN THE SAME MONTH! WHAT A GREAT PRESIDENT.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/romney-bio/	Emailed Biographies of Governor Mitt Romney	Unofficial!				2015/03/17	" 
Version 1: Mitt Romney:
 After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked as an attorney. As a venture-capitalist, Romney’s first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people.
 Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the “Bain Way”) would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino’s, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King,  Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.
Got your calculators handy? Let’s recap. Volunteer campaign worker for his dad’s gubernatorial campaign 1 year.
 Unpaid intern in Governor’s office 8 years. Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years. Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years. No salary as president of the Olympics 3 years. No salary as MA governor 4 years.
 That’s a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his country, his community and his church. Why? Because that’s the kind of man Mitt Romney is! And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity,  almost 19% of his income….Obama gave 1%.
 Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.
 This is real character vs….well you know what!
 Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won’t desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or squander our money on family vacations. He, if anyone, has the experience needed to turn this financial debacle that the “Spending President” has gotten us into. We didn’t know that when Obama said he’d give us change, he meant nickels and dimes, and he and his cronies would get the big bucks. We won’t like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney’s background can do it.
But, on the minus side, he never was a “Community Organizer,” never took drugs or smoked pot. Never got drunk, Did not associate  with communists or terrorists, Nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the US. And….he was born in the U.S.A!!!!
 If you agree with me on this, please forward it to all your friends, so we can save our country!

Some Interesting Facts about Romney: Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people. Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino’s, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others. (The negative things that you’ve heard about Bain Capital happened after Romney left.) He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad’s gubernatorial campaign 1 year. He was an unpaid intern in his dad’s governor’s office for eight years. He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years. He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee for three years. He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years. He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity. Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men. 
And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income…. Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%. 
Mitt Romney is Trustworthy: He will show us his birth certificate He will show us his high school and college transcripts. He will show us his social security card. He will show us his law degree. He will show us his draft notice. He will show us his medical records. He will show us his income tax records. He will show us he has nothing to hide. 
Mitt Romney’s background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States. 
You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least you know what religion he is, and that he won’t desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility. We know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into. We won’t like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney’s background can do it.  


On the positive side, He never was a “Community Organizer”, never took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the U.S. 


We need to know the difference between the men running for America’s top office.

The Architect of Destruction  By Maureen Scott 
 Barack Obama appears to be a tormented man filled with resentment, anger, and disdain for anyone of an opinion or view other than his. He acts in the most hateful, spiteful, malevolent, vindictive ways in order to manipulate and maintain power and control over others. Perhaps, because, as a child, he grew up harboring an abiding bitterness toward the U.S. that was instilled in him by his family and mentors…it seems to have never left him. 
 It is not the color of his skin that is a problem in America . Rather it is the blackness that fills his soul and the hollowness in his heart where there should be abiding pride and love for this country. 
 Think: Have we ever heard Obama speak lovingly of the U.S. or its people, with deep appreciation and genuine respect for our history, our customs, our sufferings and our blessings? Has he ever revealed that, like most patriotic Americans, he gets “goose bumps” when a band plays “The Star Spangled Banner,” or sheds a tear when he hears a beautiful rendition of ” America the Beautiful?” Does his heart burst with pride when millions of American flags wave on a National holiday – or someone plays “taps” on a trumpet?  Has he ever shared the admiration of the military, as we as lovers of those who keep us free, feel when soldiers march by? It is doubtful because Obama did not grow up sharing our experiences or our values. He did not sit at the knee of a Grandfather or Uncle who showed us his medals and told us about the bravery of his fellow troops as they tramped through foreign lands to keep us free.  He didn’t have grandparents who told stories of suffering and then coming to America , penniless, and the opportunities they had for building a business and life for their children.
 Away from this country as a young child, Obama didn’t delight in being part of America and its greatness. He wasn’t singing our patriotic songs in kindergarten, or standing on the roadside for a holiday parade and eating a hot dog, or lighting sparklers around a campfire on July 4th as fireworks exploded over head, or placing flags on the grave sites of fallen and beloved American heroes. 
 Rather he was separated from all of these experiences and doesn’t really understand us and what it means to be an American. He is void of the basic emotions that most feel regarding this country and insensitive to the instinctive pride we have in our national heritage. His opinions were formed by those who either envied us or wanted him to devalue the United States and the traditions and patriotism that unites us. 
 He has never given a speech that is filled with calm, reassuring, complimentary, heartfelt statements about all the people in the U.S. Or one that inspires us to be better and grateful and proud that in a short time our country became a leader, and a protector of many.  Quite the contrary, his speeches always degenerate into mocking, ridiculing tirades as he faults our achievements as well as any critics or opposition for the sake of a laugh, or to bolster his ego. He uses his Office to threaten and create fear while demeaning and degrading any American who opposes his policies and actions. A secure leader, who has noble self-esteem and not false confidence, refrains from showing such dread of critics and displaying a cocky, haughty attitude.
 Mostly, his time seems to be spent causing dissension, unrest, and anxiety among the people of America , rather than uniting us (even though he was presented to us as the “Great Uniter”).  He creates chaos for the sake of keeping people separated, envious, aggrieved and ready to argue. Under his leadership Americans have been kept on edge, rather than in a state of comfort and security. He incites people to be aggressive toward, and disrespectful of, those of differing opinions.  And through such behavior, Obama has lowered the standards for self-control and mature restraint to the level of street-fighting gangs, when he should be raising the bar for people to strive toward becoming more considerate, tolerant, self-disciplined, self-sustaining, and self-assured. 
 Not a day goes by that he is not attempting to defy our laws, remove our rights, over-ride established procedures, install controversial appointees, enact divisive mandates, and assert a dictatorial form of power.
Never has there been a leader of this great land who used such tactics to harm and hurt the people and this country. 
 Never have we had a President who spoke with a caustic, evil tongue against the citizenry rather than present himself as a soothing, calming and trustworthy force. 
 Never, in this country, have we experienced how much stress one man can cause a nation of people – on a daily basis! 
 Obama has promoted the degeneration of peace, civility, and quality of cooperation between us. He thrives on tearing us down, rather than building us up. He is the Architect of the decline of America , and the epitome of a Demagogue.

NEW YORK – When Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy refused to take his cattle off land the federal government demanded for the habitat of an endangered desert tortoise, it focused the nation’s attention on an arena Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., may have preferred to be kept quiet.
An investigative report published last week by Infowars.com drew a connection between Senate Majority Leader Reid’s involvement with Chinese energy giant ENN, Chinese efforts to build massive solar facilities in the Nevada desert and the showdown between Bundy and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.
It wasn’t the first report to notice curious dealings involving the Chinese and America’s top Democrats.
Harry Reid’s last roundup: Exclusive: Joseph Farah exposes China deal possibly driving fed action against rancher
On Jan. 20, 2013, WND warned Chinese government-backed economists were proposing a plan to allow Chinese corporations to set up “development zones” in the United States as part of a plan proposed by the Chinese government to convert into equity the more than $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt owned by the Chinese government.
The next day, Jan. 21, 2013, WND documented the Obama administration had begun to allow China to acquire major ownership interests in oil and natural gas resources across the USA.
China grabs oil interests in USA
The first major intrusion of China in the U.S. oil and natural gas market can be traced to the Obama administration decision in October 2009 to allow state-owned Chinese energy giant China Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC, to purchase a multi-million dollar stake in 600,000 acres of South Texas oil and gas fields.
By allowing China to have equity interests in U.S. oil and natural gas production, the Obama administration reversed a policy of the Bush administration that in 2005 blocked China on grounds of national security concerns from a $18.4-billion dollar deal in which China planned to purchase California-based Unocal Corp.
China’s two, giant, state-owned oil companies acquiring oil and natural gas interests in the USA are CNOOC, 100-percent owned by the government of the People’s Republic of China, and Sinopec Group, the largest shareholder of Sinopac Corporation, an investment company owned by the government of the People’s Republic of China, incorporated in China in 1998, largely to acquire and operate oil and natural gas interests worldwide.
On March 6, 2012, the Wall Street Journal compiled a state-by-state list of the $17 billion in oil and natural gas equity interests CNOOC and Sinopec have acquired in the United States since 2010.
Colorado: CNOOC gained a one-third stake in 800,000 acres in northeast Colorado and southwest Wyoming in a $1.27-billion pact with Chesapeake Energy Corporation.
Louisiana: Sinopec has a one-third interest in 265,000 acres in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale after a broader $2.5-billion deal with Devon Energy.
Michigan: Sinopec gained a one-third interest in 350,000 acres in a larger $2.5-billion deal with Devon Energy.
Ohio: Sinopec acquired a one-third interest in Devon Energy’s 235,000 Utica Shale acres in a larger $2.5-billion deal.
Oklahoma: Sinopec has a one-third interest in 215,000 acres in a broader $2.5-billion deal with Devon Energy.
Texas: CNOOC acquired a one-third interest in Chesapeake Energy’s 600,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale in a $2.16-billion deal.
Wyoming: CNOOC has a one-third stake in northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming after a $1.27-billion pact with Chesapeake Energy. Sinopec gained a one-third interest in Devon Energy’s 320,000 acres as part of a larger $2.5-billion deal.
On March 6, 2012, in a separate story, the Wall Street Journal described that China’s strategy implemented since 2010 by Fu Chengyu, who has served as chairman of both CNOOC and Sinopec, involved the following components: “Seek minority states, play a passive role, and, in a nod to U.S. regulators, keep Chinese personnel at arm’s length from advanced U.S. technology.”
Harry Reid and Chinese solar investments in Nevada
On April 3, 3012, Bloomberg reported Chinese billionaire Wang Yusuo, one of China’s richest citizens and the founder of Chinese energy giant ENN Group, had teamed up with Senate Majority Leader Reid to win incentives including land 113 miles southeast of Las Vegas that ENN sought to buy for $4.5 million, less than one-eighth of the land’s $38.6 million assessed value.
Bloomberg reported ENN intended to create solar energy farms on the Nevada land, despite the nearly 50 percent plunge in solar panel prices globally in the previous 15 months that led to the bankruptcy of solar equipment maker Solyndra LLC, which had received approximately $535 million in U.S. government loan guarantees.
Bloomberg further documented ENN had contributed $40,650 individually and through its political action committee to Sen. Reid over the previous three election cycles.
Subsequently, on Sept. 4, 2012, Breitbart.com reported lawyer Rory Reid, the son of Sen. Reid, had been appointed the primary representative for ENN Energy Group, fronting the bid by the Chinese company to build a $5-billion solar panel plant on a 9,000-acre Clark County desert plot in Laughton, Nevada.
A Reuters report published on Aug. 31, 2012, documented that Reid was recruited by ENN during a 2011 trip he took to China with nine other U.S. senators, supposedly to invite Chinese investment in the United States.
The Senate group accompanying Reid on his 2011 trip to China included six other Democrats and three Republicans: Richard Shelby, R-Ala.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Johnny Isakson, R-Ga.; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.
“A tortoise isn’t the reason why BLM is harassing a 67-year-old rancher,” blogger Dana Loesch wrote last week. “They want his land.”
Loesch pointed out that Reid has been accused by ranchers in Nevada of using the BLM to control Nevada land, over 84 percent of which is already owned by the federal government, and to pay back special interests, including his top donor, Harry Whittemore, who first urged Reid to have the habitat of the desert tortoise moved before he was convicted of violating federal election laws by illegally funneling $150,000 to Reid’s 2007 reelection campaign.
Confirmed by a 71-28 Senate vote on April 9, BLM chief Neil Kornze served as a former senior adviser to Reid before he joined BLM in 2011, serving for the past year as the agency’s principal deputy director, according to a CBS local television news report broadcast in Carson City, Nevada.
In 2012, BLM and the U.S. Department of Energy published a “Final Pragmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States” that Inforwars.com charged established the basis for allowing the endangered desert tortoise to migrate habitats, paving the way to put solar energy development projects on acreage that includes public land at dispute in the Bundy standoff over grazing rights.
Loesch’s analysis of the BLM’s actions was echoed at the Moapa Valley Town board meeting last Wednesday when one of the local citizens rose to give a stirring defense of Cliven Bundy and issue a warning to the BLM.
“They can throw an army of men around there … with sniper rifles on people just like you are, men, women and children … out there, who believe they have a right to be there,” he said.
“Maybe you believe in some other place that you believe you can be. Someday they’re gonna throw that army of men around you. And then somehow they feel like they got the right … they can drop a damn tripod in the ground and set a sniper rifle on it, so if you cross a line, they can put a bullet in you. Who the hell is the man behind that trigger? I wanna know … which one of you guys gives that guy the authority to throw that rifle down? And when he does, which one of us is he going to shoot?”
“Good God, didn’t he grow up in this country? Are we gonna give it up? This is a helluva lot bigger than Clive Bundy.”
The audience erupted in applause as the man concluded his speech.
“And when Clive decides to go back in there after his cows, and they’ve got orders to shoot anyone who goes in there, I’m gonna be with him.”
Someone in the crowd piped up, “Carrying a gun I hope.”
“No, no,” he said, “because them son of a bitches will fire the next shot heard around the world … and we will fire the rest!”
The full speech can be viewed, below.
Earlier today, BLM announced it was terminating it’s operation at the Bunday ranch and would withdraw.

Harry Reid, Son’s Solar Power Scheme Linked to Bundy Ranch Standoff 

Follow the money and you’ll inevitably find out what’s really going on.


In the case of Clark County, Nevada, rancher Cliven Bundy’s standoff with federal agents from the Bureau of Land Management, the leading explanation has been that he hasn’t paid grazing fees and his cattle threaten endangered desert tortoises in the Gold Butte area.


But the fact of the BLM bringing in hundreds of armed rangers with trucks and helicopters seemed over the top for protection of a tortoise that has clearly survived despite more than a century of ranching by the Bundy family, and which the BLM had previously been slaughtering with the excuse that it lacked funding to care for the animals.


As reported by the Associated Press in August, the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center in Southern Las Vegas, funded by the BLM, was looking at killing half of its 1,400 tortoises because it could not afford to keep its doors open since the housing collapse resulted in less income from developers. So why does the BLM profess to care so much about the fate of tortoises, who seem to be doing fine, in the Gold Butte area?


Certainly it’s not all of the answer because the BLM dispute with Bundy goes back to 1993, but part of the answer may be that Gold Butte also lies inside what the BLM has called the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone, part of the federal government’s plan to put solar power plants and factories on BLM-controlled lands in six Southwestern states.


As part of the plan for the Dry Lake solar zone, any solar developers are expected to pay into a fund to “mitigate” the Gold Butte area. However, the “mitigation” activities can’t take place with cattle grazing in the area. If the mitigation doesn’t take place, no money for the BLM.


One of the companies interested in building a solar plant on BLM-controlled land is the Chinese firm ENN Energy Group, which wants to build a $5 billion solar facility in the Nevada desert near Laughlin. ENN is represented by lawyer Rory Reid, Sen. Harry Reid’s son. The Chinese firm also wants to build on a 9,000-acre plot in Clark County, where rancher Cliven Bundy is holding off the BLM, and where Rory Reid used to be the chairman of the County Commission.


According to Reuters, the County Commission voted to sell ENN the public plot of land for $4.5 million, a fraction of its appraised value of $38.6 million.


Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid has been one of ENN’s most prominent supporters. According to Reuters, he recruited the company for the project during a trip to China in 2011. Reuters also reports that Reid has tried to pressure the state’s largest power company, NV Energy, to become ENN’s first customer.


Sen. Reid has had other links to dubious power projects, including Amonix, a company with no record of success that received huge tax breaks then collapsed. There was also Nevada Geothermal, which received $98 million in federal loan guarantees but in a recent filing with the SEC revealed that it is undergoing substantial problems that threaten its ability to continue as a company.


Both Reids have denied ever discussing the ENN project or working together in any way on it, but the paper trails suggest otherwise.


A Clark County commissioner recently said that supporters of Cliven Bundy “better have funeral plans,” and the situation seems primed and ready for violence, with hundreds of federal rangers on one side, and ranchers and militia members on the other.


If blood ends up being shed over a desert tortoise, the trail of gore may lead straight to Harry Reid’s desk in the Senate chambers.

I have been informed by an Obama supporter, that if one votes straight Dem. or Rep. ticket at the polls, before you have voted for the President, you’re vote for President will not be counted. If you go to snopes.com, you will see that this is true and it tells you that it’s a good idea to vote for each candidate individually, in any case.
I’m happy to get this info and want to pass it along, since it’s already circulating among Obama supporters.
We need all our Republican votes to count, so I owe a debt of gratitude to the Democrat who”mistakingly” sent the email my way. Thanks!
Even if you know this, others may not, so please pass it on! I think everyone’s vote should count, but once, only! (Ha!)

Secret Service views of Presidents and First Ladies *Here are snippets from a book of “Impressions & Observations” of Secret Service personnel assigned to guard U.S. Presidents/First Ladies, and Vice Presidents. 
JOHN & JACQUELINE KENNEDY: *A philanderer of the highest order. * *She ordered the kitchen help to save all the left-over wine during State dinner, which mixed with fresh wine and served again during the next White House occasion.* 
*LYNDON & LADYBIRD JOHNSON *Another philanderer of the highest order. In addition, LBJ was as crude as the day is long.* *Both JFK and LBJ kept a lot of women in the White House for extramarital affairs, and both had set up “early warning systems” to alert them if/when their wives were nearby. Both Kennedy & Johnson were promiscuous and oversexed men. * *She was either naive or pretended to “not know” of her husband’s many liaisons. * 
*RICHARD & PAT NIXON ** *  *A “moral” man but very odd and weird, paranoid, etc. He had horrible relationship with his family, and in a way, was almost a recluse.* *She was quiet most of the time.* 
*SPIRO AGNEW:** Nice, decent man, everyone in the Secret Service was surprised about his downfall. 
*GERALD & BETTY FORD: ** *  *A true gentlemen who treated the Secret Service with respect and dignity. He had a great sense of humor.. * *She drank a lot!* 
*JIMMY & ROSALYN CARTER: ** *  *A complete phony who would portray one picture of himself to public and very different in private, e..g., would be shown carrying his own luggage, but the suit cases were always empty; he kept empty ones just for photo op’s. Wanted the people to see him as pious and a non-drinker, but he and his family drank alcohol a lot. He had disdain for the Secret Service, and was very irresponsible with the “football” nuclear codes. He didn’t think it was a big deal and would keep military aides at a great distance. Often does not acknowledge the presence of Secret Service personnel assigned to serve him.* *She mostly did her own thing. 
*RONALD & NANCY REAGAN: ** *  *The real deal — moral, honest, respectful, and dignified. They treated Secret Service and everyone else with respect and honor. Thanked everyone all the time. He took the time to know everyone on a personal level. * *One “favorite” story which has circulated among the Secret Service personnel was an incident early in his Presidency, when he came out of his room with a pistol tucked on his hip. The agent in charge asked: “Why the pistol, Mr. President?” He replied, “In case you boys can’t get the job done, I can help.” It was common for him to carry a pistol. When he met with Gorbachev, he had a pistol in his briefcase. Upon learning that Gary Hart was caught with Donna Rice, Reagan said, “Boys will be boys, but boys will not be Presidents.” [He obviously either did not know or forgot JFK’s and LBJ’s sexcapades!]* *She was very nice but very protective of the President; and the Secret Service was often caught in the middle. She tried hard to control what the President ate, and he would say to the agent “Come on, you gotta help me out.”  The Reagans drank wine during State dinners and special occasions only; otherwise, they shunned alcohol; the Secret Service could count on one hand the times they were served wine during their “family dinner”. For all the fake bluster of the Carters, the Reagans were the ones who lived life as genuinely moral people.* 
*GEORGE H. & BARBARA BUSH: *Extremely kind and considerate Always respectful. Took great care in making sure the agents’ comforts were taken care of. They even brought them meals, etc.  *One time Barbara Bush brought warm clothes to agents standing outside at Kennebunkport ; one agent who was given a warm hat, and when he tried to nicely say “no thanks” even though he was obviously freezing, President Bush said “Son, don’t argue with the First Lady, put the hat on..” He was the most prompt of the Presidents. He ran the White House like a well-oiled machine.* She ruled the house and spoke her mind.* 
BILL & HILLARY CLINTON:**Presidency was one giant party. Not trustworthy — he was nice because he wanted everyone to like him, but to him life is just one big game and party. Everyone knows of his sexuality.* She is another phony. Her personality would change the instant cameras were near. She hated with open disdain the military and Secret Service. She was another one who  felt people are there to serve her. She always tried to keep tabs on Bill Clinton .* 
ALBERT GORE: An egotistical ass, who was once overheard by his Secret Service detail lecturing his only son that he needed to do better in school or he “would end up like these guys” — pointing to the agents.* 
GEORGE W. & LAURA BUSH: The Secret Service loved him and Laura Bush. He was also the most physically “in shape” who had a very strict workout regimen. The Bushes made sure their entire administrative and household staff understood to respect and be considerate of the Secret Service. KARL ROVE was the one who was the most caring of the Secret Service in the administration.* *She was one of the nicest First Ladies, if not the nicest; she never had any harsh word to say about anyone.* 
BARACK & MICHELLE OBAMA: ” Clinton all over again” – hates the military and looks down on the Secret Service. He is egotistical and cunning; looks you in the eye and appears to agree with you, but turns around and does the opposite—untrustworthy. He has temper tantrums.* She is a complete bitch, who hates anybody who is not black; hates the military; and looks at the Secret Service as servants.*

Did anyone besides me wonder how they got all those signs printed and distributed far and wide, including to all the national parks and cemeteries overseas only eight to ten hours after the government shut down? Take a look at this from someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
I have worked in the government on and off for 40 years. During that time I became quite familiar with requisitions, bidding, awarding contracts etc. It is a time consuming process with bean-counters and pencil-necked bureaucrats every step of the way. The simplest request takes months not days or hours.
In less than 8 hours of the shutdown, miraculously, professionally printed 3X4 foot signs appeared all over the country in the tens of thousands saying-“this [park, facility, etc. with custom logos] closed due to government shutdown. There has not been a government shutdown in 17 years. These signs were designed, specifications were determined, signs were then requisitioned, bids were posted and vetted, government contracts were awarded. The materials were then ordered and the signs manufactured then distributed U.S. Mails or freight companies.
This shutdown was orchestrated and planned well in advance at least 6-8 months ago. Millions of tax dollars were appropriated and spent in this process. There is a paper trail a mile long leading directly to the White House.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/simpson-vent/	Angry Letter to Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson	 Unconfirmed Attribution!				2015/03/17	" 
Version of eRumor Circulating in late 2012:
 Rough language but she really makes her point clear! 
I don’t think pissed really covers it!!!!!!!!!!! 
Alan Simpson, Senator from Wyoming , Co-Chair of Obama’s deficit commission, calls senior citizens the Greediest Generation as he compared “Social Security” to a Milk Cow with 310 million teats. 
Here’s a response in a letter from PATTY MYERS in Montana 
… I think she is a little ticked off! She also tells it like it is! 
“Hey Alan, let’s get a few things straight. 
1. As a career politician, you have been on the public dole for FIFTY YEARS. 
2. I have been paying Social Security taxes for 48 YEARS (since I was 15 years old. I am now 63). 
3 My Social Security payments, and those of millions of other Americans, were safely tucked away in an interest bearing account for decades until you political pukes decided to raid the account and give OUR money to a bunch of zero ambition losers in return for votes, thus bankrupting the system and turning Social Security into a Ponzi scheme that would have made Bernie Madoff proud.. 
4. Recently, just like Lucy & Charlie Brown, you and your ilk pulled the proverbial football away from millions of American seniors nearing retirement and moved the goalposts for full retirement from age 65 to age 67. NOW, you and your shill commission is proposing to move the goalposts YET AGAIN. 
5. I, and millions of other Americans, have been paying into Medicare from Day One, and now you morons propose to change the rules of the game. Why? Because you idiots mismanaged other parts of the economy to such an extent that you need to steal money from Medicare to pay the bills. 
6. I, and millions of other Americans, have been paying income taxes our entire lives, and now you propose to increase our taxes yet again. Why? Because you incompetent bastards spent our money so profligately that you just kept on spending even after you ran out of money. 
Now, you come to the American taxpayers and say you need more to pay off YOUR debt. 
To add insult to injury, you label us “greedy” for calling “bullshit” on your incompetence. 
Well, Captain Bullshit, I have a few questions for YOU. 
1. How much money have you earned from the American taxpayers during your pathetic 50-year political career? 
2. At what age did you retire from your pathetic political career, and how much are you receiving in annual retirement benefits from the American taxpayers? 
3. How much do you pay for YOUR government provided health insurance? 
4. What cuts in YOUR retirement and healthcare benefits are you proposing in your disgusting deficit reduction proposal, or, as usual, have you exempted yourself and your political cronies? 
It is you, Captain Bullshit, and your political co-conspirators called Congress who are the “greedy” ones. It is you and your fellow nutcases who have bankrupted America and stolen the American dream from millions of loyal, patriotic taxpayers. And for what? Votes. That’s right, sir. You and yours have bankrupted America for the sole purpose of advancing your pathetic political careers. You know it, we know it, and you know that we know it. 
And you can take that to the bank, you miserable son of a bitch. 
 If you like the way things are in America delete this. 
If you agree with what a fellow Montana citizen Patty Myers says, PASS IT ON!!!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/shorebank-obama-ties/	Shorebank Bailed Out Because of Connections With Obama	Unproven!				2015/03/17	" 
This is an interesting story put together from various articles and TV shows by the British Times paper. It shows what Obama and his friends are really all about. It’s not hope and change, it is money.I warn you, the first part is a little boring, but stick with it. The second part connects all the dots for you (it will open your eyes). The end explains how Obama and all his cronies will end up as multi-billionaires. (It’s definitely worth the read. You will not be disappointed). 
A small bank in Chicago called SHOREBANK almost went bankrupt during the recession. The bank made a profit on its foreign micro-loans (see below) but had lost money in sub-prime mortgages in the US. It was facing likely closure by federal regulators. However, because the bank’s executives were well connected with members of the Obama Administration, a private rescue bailout was arranged. The bank’s employees had donated money to Obama’s Senate campaign. In other words, ShoreBank was too politically connected to be allowed to go under. ShoreBank survived and invested in many “green” businesses such as solar panel manufacturing. In fact, the bank was mentioned in one of Obama’s speeches during his election campaign because it subjected new business borrowers to eco-litmus tests.  
Prior to becoming President, Obama sat on the board of the JOYCE FOUNDATION, a liberal charity. This foundation was originally established by Joyce Kean’s family which had accumulated millions of dollars in the lumber industry. It mostly gave funds to hospitals but after her death in 1972, the foundation was taken over by radical environmentalists and social justice extremists. 
This JOYCE FOUNDATION, which is rumored to have assets of 8 billion dollars, has now set up and funded, with a few partners, something called the CHICAGO CLIMATE EXCHANGE, known as CXX. It will be the exchange (like the Chicago Grain Futures Market for agriculture) where Environmental Carbon Credits are traded. Under Obama’s new bill, businesses in the future will be assessed a tax on how much CO2 they produce (their Carbon Footprint) or in other words how much they add to global warming. If a company produces less CO2 than their allotted measured limit, they earn a Carbon Credit. This Carbon Credit can be traded on the CXX exchange. Another company, which has gone over their CO2 limit, can buy the Credit and “reduce” their footprint and tax liability. It will be like trading shares on Wall Street. 
Well, it was the same JOYCE FOUNDATION, along with some other private partners and Wall Street firms that funded the bailout of ShoreBank. The foundation is now one of the major shareholders. The bank has now been designated to be the “banking arm” of the CHICAGO CLIMATE EXCHANGE (CXX). In addition, Goldman Sachs has been contracted to run the investment trading floor of the exchange. 
So far so good; now the INTERESTING parts. One ShoreBank co-founder, named Jan Piercy, was a Wellesley College roommate of Hillary Clinton. Hillary and Bill Clinton have long supported the bank and are small investors. Another co-founder of Shorebank, named Mary Houghton, was a friend of Obama’s late mother. Obama’s mother worked on foreign MICRO-LOANS for the Ford Foundation. She worked for the foundation with a guy called Geithner. Yes, you guessed it. This man was the father of Tim Geithner, our present Treasury Secretary, who failed to pay all his taxes for two years. Another founder of ShoreBank was Ronald Grzywinski, a cohort and close friend of Jimmy Carter. 
The former ShoreBank Vice Chairman was a man called Bob Nash. He was the deputy campaign manager of Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. He also sat on the board of the Chicago Law School with Obama and Bill Ayers, the former terrorist. Nash was also a member of Obama’s White House transition team. (To jog your memories, Bill Ayers is a Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He founded the Weather Underground, a radical revolutionary group that bombed buildings in the 60s and 70s. He had no remorse for those who were killed, escaped jail on a technicality, and is still an admitted Marxist). 
When Obama sat on the board of the JOYCE FOUNDATION, he “funneled” thousands of charity dollars to a guy named John Ayers, who runs a dubious education fund. Yes, you guessed it. The brother of Bill Ayers, the terrorist. 
Howard Stanback is a board member of Shorebank. He is a former board chairman of the Woods Foundation. Obama and Bill Ayers, the terrorist, also sat on the board of the Woods Foundation. Stanback was formerly employed by New Kenwood Inc. a real estate development company co-owned by Tony Rezko. 
(You will remember that Tony Rezko was the guy who gave Obama an amazing sweet deal on his new house. Years prior to this, the law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland had represented Rezko’s company and helped him get more than 43 million dollars in government funding. Guess who worked as a lawyer at the firm at the time. Yes, Barack Obama). 
Adele Simmons, the Director of ShoreBank, is a close friend of Valerie Jarrett, a White House senior advisor to Obama. Simmons and Jarrett also sit on the board of a dubious Chicago Civic Organization. 
Van Jones sits on the board of ShoreBank and is one the marketing directors for “green” projects. He also holds a senior advisor position for black studies at Princeton University. You will remember that Mr. Van Jones was appointed by Obama in 2009 to be a Special Advisor for Green Jobs at the White House. He was forced to resign over past political activities, including the fact that he is a Marxist.  Al Gore was one of the smaller partners to originally help fund the CHICAGO CLIMATE EXCHANGE. He also founded a company called Generation Investment Management (GIM) and registered it in London, England. GIM has close links to the UK-based Climate Exchange PLC, a holding company listed on the London Stock Exchange. This company trades Carbon Credits in Europe (just like CXX will do here) and its floor is run by Goldman Sachs. 
Along with Gore, the other co-founder of GIM is Hank Paulson, the former US Treasury Secretary and former CEO of Goldman Sachs. His wife, Wendy, graduated from and is presently a Trustee of Wellesley College. Yes, the same college that Hillary Clinton and Jan Piercy, a co-founder of Shorebank attended. (They are all friends). Interesting? And now the closing… 
Because many studies have been exposed as scientific nonsense, people are slowly realizing that man-made global warming is nothing more than a money-generating hoax. As a result, Obama is working feverishly to win the race. He aims to push a Cap-and-Trade Carbon Tax Bill through Congress and into law. 
Obama knows he must get this passed before he loses his majority in Congress in the November elections. Apart from Climate Change he will”sell” this bill to the public as generating tax revenue to reduce our debt. But, it will also make it impossible for US companies to compete in world markets and drastically increase unemployment. In addition, energy prices (home utility rates) will sky rocket. 
But, here’s the KICKER (THE MONEY TRAIL). If the bill passes, it is estimated that over 10 TRIL
LION dollars each year will be traded on the CXX exchange. At a commission rate of only 4  percent, the exchange would earn close to 400 billion dollars to split between its owners, all Obama cronies. At a 2 percent rate, Goldman Sachs would also rake in 200 billion dollars each year. 
But don’t forget SHOREBANK. With 10 trillion dollars flowing though its accounts, the bank will earn close to 40 billion dollars in interest each year for its owners (more Obama cronies), without even breaking a sweat. It is estimated Al Gore alone will probably rake in 15 billion dollars just in the first year. Of course, Obama’s “commissions” will be held in trust for him at the Joyce Foundation. They are estimated to be over 8 billion dollars by the time he leaves office in 2013, if the bill passes this year. Of course, these commissions will continue to be paid for the rest of his life.  
Some financial experts think this will be the largest “scam” or”legal heist” in world history. Obama’s cronies make the Mafia look like rank amateurs. They will make Bernie Madoff’s fraud look like penny ante stuff.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/sonal-shah/	Obama Appointee With Possible Indian Terrorist Links	Truth! but She Denies It Reflects Her Views!				2015/03/17	"  Obama Appoints Indian Terrorist
     Greetings!
Shalom in Him
      Obama Appoints Terrorist        The news of Obama winning the Presidency was heard the world over, even here in the jungles of India. The Muslims across this country are ecstatic that Obama won the election and now the Hindus are happy too as he has appointed Ms. Sonal Shah to his team.
Shah has been the national coordinator for VHP-America and is a well-known name here. What people in America don’t seem to know is that the VHP is a branch of the RSS, the party which is responsible for the torture and murder of hundreds of Christians in Orissa nearby.
Some of you may remember the past reports I’ve recently sent you concerning the RSS. I wrote about their terrorism schools in India where they promote hate and violence towards Christians. In one report I wrote that it’s not just here in India, they are worldwide and are even “in your backyard”. Well, now they are in your government!
It didn’t take Obama long to start placing terrorists on his team, but even I am surprised it was this soon.
    Christians Stunned
    The Christians here are stunned. They can’t understand how a U.S. President would hire someone connected to the deaths of Believers in their country. I’m still trying to figure out how to explain it to them.
They are aware that Shah was also an active member of the VHPA, the US branch of the most virulently fascistic outfit within India. So the Believers here who were looking towards the U.S. to help stop the atrocities here in this part of the world have now lost their hope as they feel they have been left to the wolves.
  The charred remains of a Christian woman burned alive by the
RSS which is now supported by Barack Obama

We are still raising support to get our Yeshiva students out of this area. If you can help, it would show them that not all believers have forgotten them. It would help them to understand that there are Believers out there who still care.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/snopes/	Snopes.com is a secret tool of the Democratic Party to promote Barack Obama	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Original eRumor:
I have recently discovered that Snopes.com is owned by a flaming liberal and this man is in the tank for Obama. There are many things they have listed on their site as a hoax and yet you can go to Youtube yourself and find the video of Obama or others actually saying these things. So it’s up to you, but what is the value of “truth or fiction” checks if the source is faulty? I simply can’t trust Snopes.com….ever for anything that remotely resembles truth! I don’t even trust them to tell me if email chains are hoaxes anymore.
A few conservative speakers on Myspace told me about snopes.com a few months ago and I took it upon myself to do a little research to find out if it was true. Well, I found out for myself that it is true. This website is backing Obama and is covering up for him. They will say anything that makes him look bad is a hoax and they also tell lies on the other side about McCain and Palin.
Anyway just FYI please don’t use Snopes.com anymore for fact checking and make your friends aware of their political leanings as well. Many people still think Snopes.com is neutral and they can be trusted as factual. We need to make sure everyone is aware that that is a hoax in itself.
2011 eRumor:
Here is some information for those of you who think Snopes is an authority of computer web authority!!!
Most of us have gone to Snopes for verify information that we were not sure about. Now, come to find out, Snopes is not the paragon of truth we thought it was. I just eliminated them as a source of honesty and integrity. Please read and pass on to your email friends.
Snopes is heavily financed by George Soros, a huge financial supporter of Obama!
In our Search for the truth department, we find what I have suspected on many occasions. I went to Snopes to check this out and they said it was false and there were no such dockets so I Googled the Supreme Court, typed in Obama-Kagan, and guess what? Yep you got it. Snopes lied. Everyone of those dockets are there. So Here is what I wrote Snopes:
Referencing the article about Elena Kagan and Barak Obama dockets: The information you have posted stating that there were no such cases as claimed and the examples you gave are blatantly false. I went directly to the Supreme Court’s website, typed in Obama Kagan and immediately came up with all of the dockets that the article made reference to.. I have long suspected that you really slant things but this revelation is really shocking.
You exist behind a veil of half truths and distorted facts. Hoping you will be honest and forthcoming in the future is probably expecting too much.
That being said, if you really didn’t know THIS then your investigative reporting is a sham; Kagan was representing Obama in all the petitions to prove his citizenship. Now she may help rule on them. Folks, this is really ugly. Chicago Politics; and the beat goes on and on and on…
Once again the US Senate sold us out! Well, someone figured out why Obama nominated Elana Kagan for the Supreme Court…. Pull up the Supreme Courts website, go to the docket and search for Obama. Kagan was the Solicitor General for all the suits against him filed with the Supreme Court to show proof of natural born citizenship. He owed her big time. All of the requests were denied of course. They were never heard! It just keeps getting deeper and deeper, doesn’t it? The American people mean nothing any longer. It all comes down to payback time for those who compromised themselves to elect someone that really has no true right to even be there.
Here are some websites of the Supreme Court Docket: When you look up some of these hearings and guess what?? Elana Kagan is the attorney representing Obama!!!
Check out these examples:

https://www.truthorfiction.com/sowell-thomas-shut-down-101413/	Who Shut Down the Government? by Thomas Sowell	Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	"Who Shut Down the Government?
Thomas Sowell
10/4/2013 12:01:00 AM – Thomas Sowell


Even when it comes to something as basic, and apparently as simple and straightforward, as the question of who shut down the federal government, there are diametrically opposite answers, depending on whether you talk to Democrats or to Republicans.
There is really nothing complicated about the facts. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted all the money required to keep all government activities going — except for ObamaCare.
This is not a matter of opinion. You can check the Congressional Record.
As for the House of Representatives’ right to grant or withhold money, that is not a matter of opinion either. You can check the Constitution of the United States. All spending bills must originate in the House of Representatives, which means that Congressmen there have a right to decide whether or not they want to spend money on a particular government activity.
Whether ObamaCare is good, bad or indifferent is a matter of opinion. But it is a matter of fact that members of the House of Representatives have a right to make spending decisions based on their opinion.
ObamaCare is indeed “the law of the land,” as its supporters keep saying, and the Supreme Court has upheld its Constitutionality.
But the whole point of having a division of powers within the federal government is that each branch can decide independently what it wants to do or not do, regardless of what the other branches do, when exercising the powers specifically granted to that branch by the Constitution.
The hundreds of thousands of government workers who have been laid off are not idle because the House of Representatives did not vote enough money to pay their salaries or the other expenses of their agencies — unless they are in an agency that would administer ObamaCare.
Since we cannot read minds, we cannot say who — if anybody — “wants to shut down the government.” But we do know who had the option to keep the government running and chose not to. The money voted by the House of Representatives covered everything that the government does, except for ObamaCare.
The Senate chose not to vote to authorize that money to be spent, because it did not include money for ObamaCare. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says that he wants a “clean” bill from the House of Representatives, and some in the media keep repeating the word “clean” like a mantra. But what is unclean about not giving Harry Reid everything he wants?
If Senator Reid and President Obama refuse to accept the money required to run the government, because it leaves out the money they want to run ObamaCare, that is their right. But that is also their responsibility.
You cannot blame other people for not giving you everything you want. And it is a fraud to blame them when you refuse to use the money they did vote, even when it is ample to pay for everything else in the government.
When Barack Obama keeps claiming that it is some new outrage for those who control the money to try to change government policy by granting or withholding money, that is simply a bald-faced lie. You can check the history of other examples of “legislation by appropriation” as it used to be called.
Whether legislation by appropriation is a good idea or a bad idea is a matter of opinion. But whether it is both legal and not unprecedented is a matter of fact.
Perhaps the biggest of the big lies is that the government will not be able to pay what it owes on the national debt, creating a danger of default. Tax money keeps coming into the Treasury during the shutdown, and it vastly exceeds the interest that has to be paid on the national debt.
Even if the debt ceiling is not lifted, that only means that government is not allowed to run up new debt. But that does not mean that it is unable to pay the interest on existing debt.
None of this is rocket science. But unless the Republicans get their side of the story out — and articulation has never been their strong suit — the lies will win. More important, the whole country will lose.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/vets-backlash/	Vet's Backlash Against President Obama	Grass Roots Movement!				2015/03/17	" 
VET’S BACKLASH AGAINST OBAMA
 URGENT! A movement has been started by our armed forces, to get out the vote in 2014.. They are organizing themselves, but this can be done by all of us. The President, the Commander in Chief, has made the Rules of Engagement (ROE) so difficult, that our troops are often killed before they can even get permission to fight. 
Nothing has been done to stop our troops from being murdered by Afghanis they are training either. Now, the President wants the US to sign on to the UNs International Criminal Court (ICC), which would allow the UNs ICC to arrest and try US troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under US Law, and from which there is no appeal. The President, with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power. If the Non-Establishment Republicans, and Conservatives, can take back the Senate in 2014, our troops can once again be protected from unnecessary danger. Please consider this, and send it on to your mailing lists. Thank You 


Interestingly enough, when GWB was president you heard about the the military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan almost daily. With Obama in the White House, the mainstream media has been strangely quiet. 
More than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine (9) years before. Thirty died in August. During the last month, over 50 additional NATO and US servicemen have been murdered, inside jobs by those who are hired to be a force for good in Afghanistan. 
The commander in chief is AWOL. Not a peep, although he ordered the White House flag flown at half-staff for the Sikhs that were killed. There is a deep disgust, a fury, growing in the ranks of the military against the indifferent incompetence of this president. 
It has taken on a dangerous tone. No one knows what to do about him, but the anger runs deep as the deaths continue with no strategic end in sight to the idiocy of this war. Obama has had 5 years to end this futile insanity, during which time he has vacationed, golfed, campaigned, and generally ignored the plight of our men and women in uniform. But, there is now a movement afoot in the armed services to launch a massive get out the vote drive against this president. 
Not just current active duty types, but the National Guard, Reserves, the retired, and all other prior service members. This is no small special interest group, but many millions of veterans who can have an enormous impact on the outcome of the November election if they all respond. 
The million military retirees in Florida alone could mean an overwhelming victory in that state if they all show up at the polls. It might not keep another one hundred U.S. troops from dying between now and November, but a turn out to vote by the military against this heart breaking lack of leadership can make a powerful statement that hastens a change to the indifference of this shallow little man who just lets our soldiers die. 
Veterans: Please forward to your lists. High Priority!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/walter-williams-election-prediction/	2012 Election Prediction From Conservative Author Dr. WalterWilliams	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
No Matter What – By Dr. Walter Williams (Black Conservative) 
Can President Obama be defeated in 2012? No. He can’t. I am going on record as saying that President Barak Obama will win a second term. The media won’t tell you this because a good election campaign means hundreds of millions (or in Obama’s case billions) of dollars to them in advertising. But the truth is, there simply are no conditions under which Barak Obama can be defeated in 2012. 
The quality of the Republican candidate doesn’t matter. Obama gets reelected. Nine percent unemployment? No problem. Obama will win.  Gas prices moving toward five dollars a gallon? He still wins. The economy soars or goes into the gutter. Obama wins. War in the Middle East?  He wins a second term. America’s role as the leading Superpower disappears? Hurrah for Barak Obama!  The U.S. government rushes toward bankruptcy, the dollar continues to sink on world markets and the price of daily goods and services soars due to inflation fueled by Obama’s extraordinary  deficit spending? Obama wins handily. 
You are crazy Williams. Don’t you  understand how volatile politics can be when overall economic, government, and world conditions are declining?  Sure I do. And that’s why I know Obama will win. The American people are notoriously ignorant of economics. And economics is the key to why Obama should be defeated. Even when Obama’s policies lead the nation to final ruin, the majority of the American people are going to believe the bait-and-switch tactics Obama and his supporters in the media will use to explain why it isn’t his fault. After all, things were much worse than understood when he took office. 
Obama’s reelection is really a very, very simple math problem. Consider the following:  1) Blacks will vote for Obama blindly. Period. Doesn’t matter what he does. It’s a race thing. He’s one of us,  2) College educated women will vote for Obama. Though they will be offended by this, they swoon at his oratory. It’s really not more complex than that, 3) Liberals will vote for Obama. He is their great hope, 4) Democrats will vote for Obama. He is the leader of their party and his coattails will carry them to victory nationwide, 5) Hispanics will vote for Obama. He is the path to citizenship for those who are illegal and Hispanic leaders recognize the political clout they carry in the Democratic Party,  6) Union members will vote overwhelmingly for Obama. He is their key to money and power in business, state and local politics,  7) Big Business will support Obama. They already have. He has almost $1 Billion dollars in his reelection purse gained largely from his connections with Big Business and is gaining more everyday. Big Business loves Obama because he gives them access to taxpayer money so long as they support his social and political agenda,  8) The media love him. They may attack the people who work for him, but they love him. After all, to not love him would be racist,  9) Most other minorities and special interest groups will vote for him. Oddly, the overwhelming majority of Jews and Muslims will support him because they won’t vote Republican.  American Indians will support him. Obviously homosexuals tend to vote Democratic. And lastly,  10) Approximately half of independents will vote for Obama. And he doesn’t need anywhere near that number because he has all of the groups previously mentioned.  The President will win an overwhelming victory in 2012.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/we-noticed/	Sherry Hackett’s Opinion Piece Called “We Noticed” about President Obama	 Incorrect Authorship!				2015/03/17	" Version 1: 
Subject: “WE NOTICED”
This was written by Sherry Hackett, Buddy Hackett’s widow……..
President Obama:
Today I read of your administrations’ plan to re-define September 11 as a National Service Day. Sir, it’s time we had a talk………
During your campaign, Americans watched as you made mockery of our tradition of standing and crossing your heart when the Pledge of Allegiance was spoken. You, out of four people on the stage, were the only one not honoring our tradition.
YES, “We noticed.”
During one of your many speeches, Americans heard you say that you intended to visit all 57 states. We all know that Islam, not America, has 57 states.
YES, “We noticed.”
When President Bush leaned over at Ground Zero and gently placed a flower on the memorial, while you nonchalantly tossed your flower onto the pile without leaning over.
YES, “We noticed.”
Every time you apologized to other countries for America ‘s position on an issue we have wondered why you don’t share our pride in this great country. When you have heard foreign leaders berate our country and our beliefs, you have not defended us. In fact, you insulted the British Crown beyond belief.
YES, “We noticed.”
When your pastor of 20 years, “God-damned America ” and said that 9/11 was America ‘s chickens coming home to roost” and you denied having heard recriminations of that nature, we wondered how that could be. You later disassociated yourself from that church and Pastor Wright because it was politically expedient to do so.
YES, “We noticed.”
When you announced that you would transform America , we wondered why. With all her faults, America is the greatest country on earth. Sir, KEEP THIS IN MIND, “if not for America and the people who built her, you wouldn’t be sitting in the White House now.” Prior to your election to the highest office in this country, you were a senator from Illinois and from what we can glean from the records available, not a very remarkable one.
YES, “We noticed.”
All through your campaign and even now, you have surrounded yourself with individuals who are basically unqualified for the positions for which you appointed them. Worse than that, the majority of them are people who, like you, bear no special allegiance, respect, or affection for this country and her traditions.
YES, “We noticed.”
You are 9 months into your term and every morning millions of Americans wake up to a new horror heaped on us by you. You seek to saddle working Americans with a health care/insurance reform package that, along with cap and trade, will bankrupt this nation.
YES, “We noticed.”
We seek, by protesting, to let our representatives know that we are not in favor of these crippling expenditures and we are labeled  “un-American”, “racist”. We wonder how we are supposed to let you know how frustrated we are. You have attempted to make our protests seem
isolated and insignificant. Until your appointment, Americans had the right to speak out.
YES, “We noticed.”
On September 11, 2001, there were no Republicans or Democrats, only Americans. And we all grieved together and helped each other in whatever way we could. The attack on 9/11 was carried out because we are Americans.
And YES, “We noticed.”
There were many of us who prayed that as a black president you could help unite this nation. In six months you have done more to destroy this nation than the attack on 9/11. You have failed us.
YES, “We noticed.”
September 11 is a day of remembrance for all Americans. You propose to make 9/11 a “National Service Day”. While we know that you don’t share our reverence for 9/11, we pray that history will report your proposal as what it is…a disgrace.
YES, “We noticed.”
You have made a mockery of our Constitution and the office that you hold. You have embarrassed and slighted us in foreign visits and policy.
YES, “We noticed..”
We have noticed all these things. We will deal with you. When Americans come together again, it will be to remove you from office.
Take notice

Tagg Romney Invested in Ohio Electronic Voting Machines 
If the Romney’s can’t win legally, they’ll take over Ohio’s electronic voting machines through investments, a direct conflict of interest in a contentious state in this election. The new owners of Ohio’s voting machines under the brand name HART Intercivic is none other than Tagg Romney the son of one of the candidates Mitt Romney. In recent weeks Tagg has taken a more ‘active role in his father’s campaign management’ but when you look further, he also has a major problem with that role. By virtue of conflict of interest alone, this role should be investigated by the DOJ preferably involving the addition of the FBI, Homeland Security and the CIA to ensure this connection will not endanger the vote in Ohio and other states.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/tonyshow/	Tony Snow testimoney of faith during cancer	Truth!				2015/03/17	"  This is a testimony from Tony Snow, President Bush’s Press Secretary, and his fight with cancer. Commentator and broadcaster Tony Snow announced that he had colon cancer in 2005. Following surgery and chemotherapy, 
 Snow joined the Bush Administration in April 2006 as press secretary. Unfortunately, on March 23, 2007, Snow, 51, a husband and father of three, announced the cancer had recurred, with tumors found in his abdomen, leading to surgery in April, followed by more chemotherapy. Snow went back to work in the White House Briefing Room on May 30, but has resigned since, “for economic reasons”, and to pursue “other interests”. 
  
“Blessings arrive in unexpected packages, – in my case, cancer. Those of us with potentially fatal diseases – and there are millions in America today – find ourselves in the odd position of coping with our mortality while trying to fathom God’s will. Although it would be the height of presumption to declare with confidence “What It All Means”, Scripture provides powerful hints and consolations. 
The first is that we shouldn’t spend too much time trying to answer the “why” questions: Why me? Why must people suffer? Why can’t someone else get sick? We can’t answer such things, and the questions themselves often are designed more to express our anguish than to solicit an answer. 
I don’t know why I have cancer, and I don’t much care. It is what it is, a plain and indisputable fact. Yet even while staring into a mirror darkly, great and stunning truths begin to take shape. Our maladies define a central feature of our existence: We are fallen. We are imperfect. Our bodies give out. 
But despite this, – or because of it, – God offers the possibility of salvation and grace. We don’t know how the narrative of our lives will end, but we get to choose how to use the interval between now and the moment we meet our Creator face-to-face. 
Second, we need to get past the anxiety. The mere thought of dying can send adrenaline flooding through your system… A dizzy, unfocused panic seizes you. Your heart thumps; your head swims. You think of nothingness and swoon. You fear partings; you worry about the impact on family and friends. You fidget and get nowhere. 
To regain footing, remember that we were born not into death, but into life, – and that the journey continues after we have finished our days on this earth. We accept this on faith, but that faith is nourished by a conviction that stirs even within many non believing hearts – an intuition that the gift of life, once given, cannot be taken away. Those who have been stricken enjoy the special privilege of being able to fight with their might, main, and faith to live fully, richly, and exuberantly – no matter how their days may be numbered. 
 Third, we can open our eyes and hearts. God relishes surprise. We want lives of simple, predictable ease,- smooth, even trails as far as the eye can see, – but God likes to go off-road. He provokes us with twists and turns. He places us in predicaments that seem to defy our endurance; and comprehension – and yet don’t. By His love and grace, we persevere. The challenges that make our hearts leap and stomachs churn invariably strengthen our faith and grant measures of wisdom and joy we would not experience otherwise. 
‘You Have Been Called’. Picture yourself in a hospital bed. The fog of anesthesia has begun to wear away. A doctor stands at your feet; a loved one holds your hand at the side. “It’s cancer,” the healer announces. 
The natural reaction is to turn to God and ask him to serve as a cosmic Santa. “Dear God, make it all go away. Make everything simpler.” But another voice whispers: “You have been called.” Your quandary has drawn you closer to God, closer to those you love, closer to the issues that matter, – and has dragged into insignificance the banal concerns that occupy our “normal time”. 
There’s another kind of response, although usually short-lived an inexplicable shudder of excitement, as if a clarifying moment of calamity has swept away everything trivial and tiny, and placed before us the challenge of important questions. 
The moment you enter the Valley of the Shadow of Death, things change. You discover that Christianity is not something doughy, passive, pious, and soft. Faith may be the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. But it also draws you into a world shorn of fearful caution. The life of belief teems with thrills, boldness, danger, shocks, reversals, triumphs, and epiphanies. Think of Paul, traipsing through the known world and contemplating trips to what must have seemed the antipodes ( Spain ), shaking the dust from his sandals, worrying not about the morrow, but only about the moment. 
There’s nothing wilder than a life of humble virtue, – for it is through selflessness and service that God wrings from our bodies and spirits the most we ever could give, the most we ever could offer, and the most we ever could do. Finally, we can let love change everything. When Jesus was faced with the prospect of crucifixion, he grieved not for himself, but for us. He cried for Jerusalem before entering the holy city. >From the Cross, he took on the cumulative burden of human sin and weakness, and begged for forgiveness on our behalf. 
 We get repeated chances to learn that life is not about us, that we acquire purpose and satisfaction by sharing in God’s love for others. Sickness gets us part way there. It reminds us of our limitations and dependence. But it also gives us a chance to serve the healthy. A minister friend of mine observes that people suffering grave afflictions often acquire the faith of two people, while loved ones accept the burden of two peoples’ worries and fears. 
‘Learning How to Live’. Most of us have watched friends as they drifted toward God’s arms, not with resignation, but with peace and hope. In so doing, they have taught us not how to die, but how to live. They have emulated Christ by transmitting the power and authority of love. 
I sat by my best friend’s bedside a few years ago as a wasting cancer took him away. He kept at his table a worn Bible and a 1928 edition of the Book of Common Prayer. A shattering grief disabled his family, many of his old friends, and at least one priest. Here was a humble and very good guy, someone who apologized when he winced with pain because he thought it made his guest uncomfortable. He retained his equanimity and good humor literally until his last conscious moment. “I’m going to try to beat [this cancer],” he told me several months before he died. “But if I don’t, I’ll see you on the other side.” 
His gift was to remind everyone around him that even though God doesn’t promise us tomorrow, he does promise us eternity, – filled with life and love we cannot comprehend, – and that one can in the throes of sickness point the rest of us toward timeless truths that will help us weather future storms. 
Through such trials, God bids us to choose: Do we believe, or do we not? Will we be bold enough to love, daring en
ough to serve, humble enough to submit, and strong enough to acknowledge our limitations? Can we surrender our concern in things that don’t matter so that we might devote our remaining days to things that do? 
When our faith flags, he throws reminders in our way. Think of the prayer warriors in our midst. They change things, and those of us who have been on the receiving end of their petitions and intercessions know it. It is hard to describe, but there are times when suddenly the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, and you feel a surge of the Spirit. Somehow you just know: Others have chosen, when talking to the Author of all creation, to lift us up, – to speak of us! 
This is love of a very special order. But so is the ability to sit back and appreciate the wonder of every created thing. The mere thought of death somehow makes every blessing vivid, every happiness more luminous and intense. We may not know how our contest with sickness will end, but we have felt the ineluctable touch of God. 
What is man that Thou art mindful of him? We don’t know much, but we know this: No matter where we are, no matter what we do, no matter how bleak or frightening our prospects, each and every one of us who believe, each and every day, lies in the same safe and impregnable place, in the hollow of God’s hand.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/teaparty/	Come to the Tax Day Tea Party Rally and Mail a Teabag to the Whitehouseto Protest Wasteful Government Spending	  Grass Roots Movement!				2015/03/17	" 
There’s a storm abrewin’. What happens when good, responsible people keep quiet? Washington has forgotten they work for us. We don’t work for them. Throwing good money after bad is NOT the answer. I am sick of the midnight, closed door sessions to come up with a plan. I am sick of Congress raking CEO’s over the coals while they, themselves, have defaulted on their taxes. I am sick of the bailed out companies having lavish vacations and retreats on my dollar. I am sick of being told it is MY responsibility to rescue people that, knowingly, bought more house than they could afford. I am sick of being made to feel it is my patriotic duty to pay MORE taxes. I, like all of you, am a responsible citizen. I pay my taxes. I live on a budget and I don’t ask someone else to carry the burden for poor decisions I may make. I have e-mailed my congressmen and senators asking them to NOT vote for the stimulus package as it was written without reading it first. No one listened. They voted for it, pork and all. 
O.K. folks, here it is. You may think you are just one voice and what you think won’t make a difference. Well, yes it will and YES, WE CAN!! If you are disgusted and angry with the way Washington is handling our taxes. If you are fearful of the fallout from the reckless spending of BILLIONS to bailout and “stimulate” without accountability and responsibility then we need to become ONE, LOUD VOICE THAT CAN BE HEARD FROM EVERY CITY, TOWN, SUBURB AND HOME IN AMERICA. There is a growing protest to demand that Congress, the President and his cabinet LISTEN to us, the American Citizens. What is being done in Washington is NOT the way to handle the economic free fall. 
So, here’s the plan. On April 1, 2009, all Americans are asked to send a TEABAG to Washington , D.C. You do not have to enclose a note or any other information unless you so desire. Just a TEABAG. Many cities are organizing protests. If you simply search, “New American Tea Party”, several sites will come up. If you aren’t the ‘protester’ type, simply make your one voice heard with a TEABAG. Your one voice will become a roar when joined with millions of others that feel the same way. Yes, something needs to be done but the lack of confidence as shown by the steady decline in the stock market speaks volumes. 
This was not my idea. I visited the sites of the ‘New American Tea Party’s and an online survey showed over 90% of thousands said they would send the tea bag on April 1. Why, April 1?? We want them to reach Washington by April 15. Will you do it? I will. Send it to; 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington , D.C. 20500 . 
Forward this to everyone in your address book. Visit the website below for more information about the ‘New American Tea Party’. I would encourage everyone to go ahead and get the envelope ready to mail, then just drop it in the mail April 1. Can’t guarantee what the postage will be by then, it is going up as we speak, but have your envelope ready. What will this cost you? A little time and a 40 something cent stamp. 
What could you receive in benefits? Maybe, just maybe, our elected officials will start to listen to the people. Take out the Pork. Tell us how the money is being spent. We want TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. Remember, the money will be spent over the next 4-5 years. It is not too late.
Of course, if you agree with the way things are being done now, just delete!!!!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/thomas-sowell/	Thomas Sowell Endorses John McCain?	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"  Thomas Sowell is a syndicated columnist and Senior Fellow of the Hoover  Institution at Stanford University in Stanford, CA. This past week, he  wrote in a column titled “Random Thoughts”, and published in newspapers  nationally, the following:    “Senator John McCain could never convince me to vote for him.  Only Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama can cause me to vote for McCain.”    Oh, and in case you aren’t familiar with Thomas Sowell, He happens to be  black.    PLEASE READ THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH!    —– After long and serious thought, I have decided to endorse Senator  John McCain for President.    I have always voted for the person and have not voted for anyone because  some political party was telling me who I should vote for.    We all know the choices by now and, that said, I do believe that the  process of selecting a chief executive is deeply flawed. The words “money”  and “special interests” come to mind, among many others.    Here’s the way I see it:    Barack Obama, you are a fine public speaker. You are also an extremely  liberal Senator from the State of Illinois, which has a long and rich  history of political corruption of the first magnitude. You are indeed a  child of that system.    You have finally insulted my intelligence far beyond my capacity to  tolerate your insults. It has nothing at all to do with your skin color.  As a matter of fact, it would be so COOL to finally have an  African-American for President. What a great statement that would be to the  entire world that we are indeed the greatest country on earth!    But, unfortunately, General Colin Powell is not running, and YOU are NOT  the man for this job !    Barack baby, you want me to believe that you have never heard the sermons  of your own pastor, the Right Reverend “God Damn America” Jeremiah Wright.  It is a matter of record that this has been your church for over 20 years.  It is a matter of record that you were married there by this very pastor,  and that your children were baptized there.    The good Reverend saw fit to visit Khadafy in Libya with you and to give  a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan, of all people.    We have all now seen excerpts of his sermons all over the airwaves by now.  And you have publicly stated that this man IS your “spiritual mentor”.    BUT, your pastor is NOT the reason I am NOT voting for you. His words were  disturbing enough, but it is your own HUGE church congregation, seen  jumping, hooting and howling to his words in the background that disturb  me the most. And please don’t tell me you attended church there and never  once heard a “discouraging word” in the 20 years you attended there. Don’t  tell me, that in addition to the good reverend, that you are now not  having anything to do with all those other people seen hooting and howling  out in the audience in the background of his fiery tirades.    Even Oprah Winfrey got disgusted and walked out. I am no Oprah fan, but  still she did the right thing.    Now YOU look me in the eye and ask me to believe that you never heard such  language in all the years you attended there ! This is like me telling you  that I attended dozens of Klan rallys and never once heard the “N” word.  Yep. And Bill Clinton “did not inhale”.    Yes, Mr. Obama, we all have friends who have said stupid things that  embarrassed us, but NOW you have asked me to believe something that is so  incredibly stupid that you are telling me that I am just stupid enough to  believe you. THAT is the main reason that I will never vote for you. I  am deeply sorry, that in a country teeming with enormously talented  African Americans who would make a good President, that the political  system has chosen YOU. You are a pathetic and plastic excuse for an  American, who will not even salute the Flag during the Pledge of  Allegiance. God forbid you ever get near the Oval Office.    Now, did I mention Bill Clinton ?    AH YES ! This brings us to MRS. WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, who this  candidate really is, in spite of all the other names she may care to call  herself. This “feminist” piece of work of course would like to be referred  to as MS. And we all know who wears the pant suit in that family.    MS. Clinton, (sugar), it is just as depressing to realize that there are  dozens of women who would also make great Presidents. But, fortunately,  the horrible state of the selection process has selected YOU. Ms. Clinton,  I’m sorry, but you could not tell the truth if we waterboarded your  worthless a– !    Still you play the role of the “embarrassed but dignified noble wife”.  What utter malarkey! I am not voting for you for a world of reasons, but  the main one is the same as my not voting for Senator Obama. You  persistently insult my intelligence. It COULD be conceivably possible  that you did not know about Monica Lewinsky, extremely remote, but possible  if we stretch our imaginations a bit. But you turn around and then ask me  to believe that you also did not know about Paula Jones and the legion of  other women who were chewed up and spit out by your lecherous excuse for a  husband. Puleese turn off this broken record !!!    But let’s set aside your hubby’s flagrant peccadilloes. The real reason I  will never vote for you is that I don’t think the country can survive EIGHT  MORE YEARS of Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, Sandy Berger stuffing his  socks with classified intelligence, Janet Reno’s goon squad, and the  myriad other corruptions that seem to stick to you like your ugly face. So  our former President can’t keep his dick in his pants. The REAL issue is  that he committed perjury under oath when he lied about it and the  pathetically-attempted coverup that followed.    Like you, he is totally incapable of telling the truth. He could not do it  if you tortured him, and in voting for you, we would get the BOTH of you,  all over again. The same folks who could have taken out Osama Bin Laden  over 4,000 dead Americans ago !    And please stop telling me that you have “8 years of experience” to lead  us. You were the freakin’ first lady already, not the Commander in Chief.  Jeez ! The sum of your “experience” is that of the most worrisome and  incompetent meddling in the history of the White House. You even cursed  your pitiful staff and the Secret Service agents who were and still are  unfortunately charged with risking their lives to protect your worthless,  thieving hide, and all at the expense of other people who have to work for  a living.    Your single pathetic platform is to finance the illegal drugs, alcoholism  and bad habits of the very lowest and most irresponsible freeloaders in  America and to then “garnish the wages” (your own words) of every  law-abiding and hard-working American to pay for it. This disaster you  refer to as “Universal Health Care”. Where have you been the last 30 years  ? Did you not see that socialism is a failure wherever it has been tried  ? Did you not notice that the Soviet Union has collapsed since it gave no  reward to those who worked the hardest for the fruits of their own labors  to pay for those who will not ??    It is interesting to see all the dead bodies that you and your hubby have  left in your wake. Suicides, mysterious deaths, cover-ups that ma
ke  Richard Nixon look like a rank amateur. The utter contempt and  unbelievable arrogance of some of your strongest supporters, most notably  the recently resigned and disgraced Governor Eliot Spitzer, the epitome of  hypocritical and malevolent arrogance gone wild, one of your most ardent,  wealthy and powerful political supporters. A man the news media refuses to  admit IS a “super delegate” in your own political machine, a fine example  of your own “adopted” state of New York. No wonder you moved there to run  for Senator ! The environment there is perfect for the likes of you !    Yes, I would vote for a woman, but I will NOT vote for YOU !    Which leaves us with Senator John McCain.    John, you are a flawed man. You are a bit old, a bit looney, and you have  a notoriously bad temper. This perfectly qualifies you, in my humble  opinion, to lead us for the next eight years. I WANT your trembling hand  on the nuclear button.    Think about it.    We have Kim Jong IL, Chavez and Ahmadenijad all running around like  lunatics, threatening America and threatening to plunge the world into  nuclear Armageddon. We have Putin and the Chinese blustering and rattling  their sabers at us. I want John McCain in the Oval Office and I want him  to be really pissed off at all these other nut jobs around the planet.    John, once you are elected, I want you to go into the Oval Office and  throw one of your perfect FITS. Jump up and down and throw something  through a plate glass window. Rip the drapes down and foam at the mouth a  bit. And I want the whole thing on camera so that Ahmadinejad can see it.  I want ALL of these “world leaders” to lay awake at night and to break out  in a cold sweat every time they think of messing with the United States of  America.    I want the nuclear button sitting right next to the alarm clock on your  night stand. I want pictures of this to be sent to Iran, Russia, China,  Venezuela, Cuba, Libya, Syria, Pakistan, and those other a– holes in the  sheets, the Saudis.    On the domestic front, poor John did try and reach across the aisle to the  opposition in a desperate effort to compromise and to get the Congress to  do something. You may not agree with his efforts, but at least he TRIED.  For all his efforts, all he got handed to him was his head in a basket.  The liberals are pissed at him and the conservatives are pissed at him.  Just my kinda guy.    I predict that John will select Senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate.  Good choice. I want a Jew whose memory of the Holocaust is still fresh in  his mind and who is royally pissed off at all of these towel-headed morons  in the Middle East to be the next in line if something should happen to  John. Shalom, Vice President Joe. One heartbeat from the Oval Office.    Finally. John McCain knows on a most personal level what it is to suffer  horrible torture for years and to see others die, right in front of you,  for their love of America. When you ask him about it, he will tell you  that what he did was “nothing special”. Even more incredibly, he states  that ANY American who truly loves his country would do exactly the same as  he did in that situation. You and I will have a hard time believing that,  but the real point is that John McCain believes that about the “average  American”, and that, dear friends and neighbors, is why I will cast my one  ballot on election day for John McCain — warts and all.    God Bless America,

https://www.truthorfiction.com/vietflag/	Clinton may fly the Viet Nam flag higher than the U.S. Flag	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" © 2000 WorldNetDaily.com Story:
 President Clinton reportedly plans to visit China and Vietnam before the end of his term, and according to high-ranking Navy officers, the commander in chief will alter long-standing naval regulations to allow the American flag to fly below that of Vietnam when he sails into the communist nation’s territorial waters on a U.S. Navy ship.
 Highly placed Navy sources who spoke on condition of anonymity believe this action on the president’s part would further devastate already tenuous Navy morale. As part of his swan song, Clinton reportedly intends to visit two ports aboard Naval vessels. Trip one takes him to the People’s Republic of China, which has a regulation that no war ship of any country may enter its territorial waters flying a flag higher than that of the People’s Republic of China.
 According to one Navy source, China and the U.S. have effected a compromise whereby both flags-the U.S. and the PRC-will be flown from U.S. naval vessels at the same height. But visceral outrage is resulting from a proposed change to Navy regulations that would result in the American flag being displayed subordinate to the flag of Vietnam. Navy regulations and tradition prescribe that no country’s flag will be displayed in a superior position to the U.S. flag. However, Vietnam’s rules reportedly demand that the Vietnamese flag shall always fly in a superior position to any other country’s flag.
 High-ranking naval officers, speaking on condition that their names not be published, say the reason for all the alarm, anger and career-threatening rhetoric is that Clinton allegedly has either ordered, or is about to order, the secretary of the Navy to amend regulations to permit the Vietnamese flag to be displayed over the U.S. flag. “I’d like to blow the @#&*% thing up!” said one frustrated officer.
 The United States Navy Regulations began with the enactment by the Continental Congress of the “Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies” on Nov. 28, 1775. So a long and proud history bolsters the long-held Navy tradition that no country’s flag will fly higher than that of the United States. Commenting on the report, Col. David Hackworth, America’s most decorated living war veteran, said, “What’s new? Clinton has done everything else to dishonor the flag, why not make it number two?” He added, “Congress ought to pull this traitor’s travel plug … now.”
 Calls to the Navy Staff Operations and Special Events office were referred to the Public Affairs Office, which then referred WND to the news desk. When WND outlined the scenario, the spokesman-whose first comment was, “Wow” – later called back to say, “We haven’t been able to find anything on it yet, but we’re trying to run the story to ground.” Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, reportedly has visited the People’s Republic of China recently also, although the reason for the trip is not known.
 NOTE: Some of you may wonder what the fuss is about, but please remember that the Navy prides itself on honor and tradition. The Naval Officers are not being “childish and petty” when they speak out against this. Morale is at an all-time low, and military commands do not need to once again be berated for their job. How does this “slap in the face” decision fall under the power(s) of the Commander in Chief? It reminds me of when Hillary ordered that uniforms not be worn by the White House in-house Marines. This order still stands, if you visit the White House today, 8 yrs. later. What used to be a sought-after, privileged job, is now seen as a tour of punishment by these young Marines who stand around in civilian clothes. They not only lost their uniform but their self-esteem to be seen in the uniform they are asked to defend. How much more can the people that are asked to defend our freedom take? The crews on the Navy ships leave their families and loved ones behind more than 6 months at a time. Everything possible should be done to praise and encourage them for their dedication! Clinton will enjoy his boat ride for a few hours and never look back to see the eyes of the men and women who serve our country.
 Just as the Clinton Administration will never look back at the damage that has been done to our Military and to this Nation.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/weston-candidate-arrested/	Candidate Arrested in U.K. for Quoting Winston Churchill	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Quoting from the great WWII statesman Winston Churchill’s literary work, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953, has become a criminal offence in the UK—as it seems.
Paul Weston, chairman of the UK’s Liberty GB party and a candidate in the 22 May European Parliament Elections, was arrested by the British police on 26 April for quoting a passage from Winston Churchill’s book.
At around 2pm, Weston was addressing the passers-by on the street from the steps of Winchester Guildhall with a megaphone. He quoted the following passage about Islam from Churchill book, The River War:
“How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.”
Reportedly a woman, who found the passage “disgusting”, came out of the Guildhall and called the police.
Responding to her call, six or seven police officers arrived and questioned Weston for about 40 minutes.
At about 3pm, they arrested and searched him, and took him away in a police van.

Presidents of ABC and CBS News Have Siblings Working at White House With Ties to Benghazi
By Noel Sheppard | May 11, 2013 | 17:09
 http://m.newsbusters.org/bios/noel-sheppard
“CBS News President David Rhodes and ABC News President Ben Sherwood, both of them have siblings that not only work at the White House, that not only work for President Obama, but they work at the NSC on foreign policy issues directly related to Benghazi.”
So stated political consultant and media commentator Richard Grenell on Saturday’s Fox News Watch (video follows with transcript and commentary):
RICHARD GRENELL: I think the media’s becoming the story, let’s face it. CBS News President David Rhodes and ABC News President Ben Sherwood, both of them have siblings that not only work at the White House, that not only work for President Obama, but they work at the NSC on foreign policy issues directly related to Benghazi. Let’s call a spade a spade.
Let’s also show you why CNN did not go very far in covering these hearings because the CNN deputy bureau chief, Virginia Moseley, is married to Hillary Clinton’s deputy, Tom Nides. It is time for the media to start asking questions why are they not covering this. It’s a family matter for some of them.
JON SCOTT, HOST: So they don’t want to bring embarrassment upon folks who, who they’re close to?
GRENELL: Who directly are related to this story. Absolutely. They’re covering for them. There’s no question about it. For the record, Ben Sherwood’s sister, Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, is the Special Assistant to Barack Obama. Virginia Moseley’s husband, Tom Nides, is the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources.
——————————————————————————–
As for David Rhodes’ brother Ben, he is Obama’s Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communication.
As ABCNews.com reported Friday, Rhodes was a key player in revising the White House’s Benghazi talking points last September:
In an email dated 9/14/12 at 9:34 p.m. — three days after the attack and two days before Ambassador Rice appeared on the Sunday shows – Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes wrote an email saying the State Department’s concerns needed to be addressed.
“We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don’t want to undermine the FBI investigation. We thus will work through the talking points tomorrow morning at the Deputies Committee meeting.”
After that meeting, which took place Saturday morning at the White House, the CIA drafted the final version of the talking points – deleting all references to al Qaeda and to the security warnings in Benghazi prior to the attack.
Consider, too, that CBS News executives possibly including Rhodes have allegedly come down on their own investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson for “wading dangerously close to advocacy on” Benghazi.
If Attkisson gets the boot, it could very well be with a foot attached to the brother of an Obama administration official directly involved in the cover-up.   A family matter indeed.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/us-billion-to-ukraine/	U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine will go to Russia	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Let me see if I have this right……
 Ukraine buys almost all its energy (natural gas) from Russia.
 
Revenues from natural gas sales are a primary source of income for Russia.
 
Because of the recent disagreement between Ukraine and Russia, Russia is raising the price of natural gas it sells to Ukraine.
 
Ukraine is almost broke and can’t afford the increase in the natural gas price because it would be forced into bankruptcy.
 
Obama (the USA) just announced the United States is giving Ukraine $1 billion to assist in paying for the higher priced natural gas it buys from Russia.
So, the United States is actually giving Russia $1 billion because the money is just passing through Ukraine.
 
The first question: Has Putin figured out a way to raise the price of his natural gas sales and make the U.S. pay for the increase?
 
Next question: Was he really in the KGB or was he a commodities trader?
 
If this analysis is accurate, Putin just got Obama (the USA) to pay him $1 billion by holding a press conference and trucking some troops across town from the Russian Navy base in Ukraine.
 
Who is the smartest guy in the room now?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/alex-wagner-resigns/	Alex Wagner Leaves MSNBC Blaming Obama's Lies	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Gee, what a surprise!!!! 


According to inside sources, MSNBC host Alex Wagner, host of “NOW with Alex Wagner”, 
resigned from her post today after 2 1/2 years with the network citing ethical and moral concerns.  


In a resignation letter obtained by National Report, Wagner claims she has been spreading “lies on behalf of Obama” and using her position with MSNBC to “falsely promote a brutal dictator.” 


Wagner goes on to say, “I have spent my entire professional career working toward a position based on false pretenses. I have worked hard to obtain a position with a major news network and expected to be reporting on serious issues. Instead, I am handed Pro-Obama scripts and asked to be a mouthpiece for the administration.” 


A CNN report this afternoon suggested Wagner had recently been empowered by the bravery of Russia Today reporter Liz Wahl, who quit her Kremlin-funded network during a live broadcast. 


A second RT reporter, Sara Firth, left her position with the network today as well, giving Wagner the confidence to make the decision to walk away from her show. 


Executives with MSNBC are reportedly working hard to manage the fallout following the news and are doing their best to lessen the impact to their credibility by suppressing the story. 


Paul Horner, spokesman for MSNBC, issued a press release this afternoon claiming Wagner had long been unhapp y with a contract negotiation and her move was simply a “promotional stunt.” (YEAH, RIGHT!) 


It is not yet known who will replace Wagner on her 4:00 show. Early reports suggest the network will be making programming adjustments over the weekend.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/george-will-obama/	George Will on President Obama	 Incorrect Authorship!				2015/03/17	" George Will on President Obama
America has had some great presidents, many mediocre ones and a few bad ones. But we’ve never had one like Barack Obama. He’s the first who thinks the job is beneath him.
He’s the first who turns political give-and-take into a crisis by refusing to negotiate with Congress.
He’s the first who thinks the way to more power is to inflict pain on ordinary people.
The move to barricade the World War II memorial reveals the mentality of a tin-pot dictator. The limited government shutdown did not need to affect the memorial because it is open 24 hours, without gates and often without guards.
But to turn public opinion in his favor, Obama’s goons trucked in barricades to keep out World War II vets and other visitors. By one estimate, the barricades and workers cost $100,000.
The same punish-the-people attitude led to shutdowns of other parks and historic sites that get no federal funding.
“We’ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It’s disgusting,” a Park Service ranger told The Washington Times.
The ranger cited the order to close the parking lot at George Washington’s home in Mount Vernon so visitors couldn’t use it. The cheap trick captured the contrast between a revered president and the current one.
I’ve been saying for a while that there is no bottom to Obama. He’s not just ruthless. He’s without scruples and honor.
Now the shutdown has ended, it will bring only a temporary respite from the crisis atmosphere in Washington. When it comes to his countrymen, Obama always chooses conflict over cooperation.
Meanwhile, Jimmy Carter can rest easy. We have a new worst president.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/vaughn-letter/	Parents of Fallen SEAL Team 6 Officer Call for Obama’sResignation	Authorship Confirmed!				2015/03/17	" Billy and Karen Vaughn  
After finally choosing to view the barbaric, on-camera beheading by ISIS of freelance war correspondent James Foley, I have been left with a level of rage known only to those of us who have sacrificed unspeakable offerings on the altar of world peace.  
My offering was my only son — Aaron Carson Vaughn. Aaron was a member of SEAL Team VI. He was killed in action when a CH47D Chinook, carrying thirty Americans and eight Afghans was shot down in the Tangi River Valley of Afghanistan on Aug. 6, 2011. 
Many times over the past three years, I have been asked what drove my son to choose his particular career. What made him want to be a Navy SEAL? My answer is simple. 
Aaron Vaughn was a man who possessed the courage to acknowledge evil. And evil, once truly acknowledged, demands response. Perhaps this is why so few are willing to look it in the eye. It is much simpler — much safer — to look the other way. 
That is, unless you are the leader of the Free World. 
As Commander-in-Chief, your actions — or lack thereof — Mr. President, cost lives. As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in America’s security — but the security of the entire globe. Your message has come across loud and clear, sir: You are not up to this job. You know it. We know it. The world knows it. 
Please vacate the people’s house and allow a man or woman of courage and substance to seize the reigns of this out-of-control thug-fest and regain the balance we, America, have provided throughout our great history. 
Thanks to your “leadership” from whatever multi-million dollar vacation you happen to be on at any given moment, the world is in chaos. What’s been gained, you’ve lost. What’s been lost, you’ve decimated. You’ve demolished our ability to hold the trust of allies. You’ve made a mockery of the title “President.” And you’ve betrayed the nation for which my son and over 1.3 million others have sacrificed their very lives. 
But this should come as no surprise, since your wife uttered a vile statement on Feb. 18, 2008, during the primary campaign — one that speaks volumes of your true convictions. “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country,” she said. 
I am sure my deceased son thanks you for that, Mrs. Obama. Oh, and you’re welcome. 
Never in my lifetime have I witnessed such despair and such growing fear that the world’s last best hope, America, has finally been dismantled. Perhaps the better word is transformed — fundamentally transformed. Come to think of it, it’s become difficult — if not impossible — to believe things haven’t gone exactly as you planned, Mr. President. 
Amazingly, in five short years, your administration has lurched from one disaster to another. You spearheaded the ambitious rush to end the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan — with no plan on how to do so effectively. Also, the release of “the Taliban five” in exchange for one American — without consulting Congress — is on your shoulders. 
You have been at the helm during unprecedented national security leaks — including, but not limited to the outing of SEAL Team VI on the Bin laden raid, the outing of the Pakistani doctor who provided the intelligence for that raid, the outing of Afghanistan’s CIA station chief, and the outing of your personal “kill list” to make you look tough. In addition, 75 percent of American deaths in Afghanistan and 83 percent of Americans-wounded-in-action have occurred on your watch, according to icasualties.org. 
And now, we have this recent, heinous event: the beheading of an American citizen by a barbaric organization you foolishly referred to as “the JV team” in your statements to the New Yorker magazine in January. 
You, sir, are the JV team. It’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters. 
America has always been exceptional. And she will be again. You, Mr. President, are a bump in our road.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/benstein-health-plan/	Ben Stein wrote an article as to why President Obama is eager to promote the Universal Health Care Plan	Truth!  but it is an opinion!				2015/03/17	" We’ve Figured Him Out   By Ben Stein  
 Why is President Barack Obama in such a hurry to get his socialized medicine bill passed?
 Because he and his cunning circle realize some basic truths:
 The American people in their unimaginable kindness and trust voted for a pig in a poke in 2008. They wanted so much to believe Barack Obama was somehow better and different from other ultra-leftists that they simply took him on faith.
 They ignored his anti-white writings in his books. They ignored his quiet acceptance of hysterical anti-American diatribes by his minister, Jeremiah Wright.
 They ignored his refusal to explain years at a time of his life as a student. They ignored his ultra-left record as a “community organizer,” Illinois state legislator, and Senator.
 The American people ignored his total zero of an academic record as a student and teacher, his complete lack of scholarship when he was being touted as a scholar.
 Now, the American people are starting to wake up to the truth. Barack Obama is a super likeable super leftist, not a fan of this country, way, way too cozy with the terrorist leaders in the Middle East, way beyond naïveté, all the way into active destruction of our interests and our allies and our future.
 The American people have already awakened to the truth that the stimulus bill — a great idea in theory — was really an immense bribe to Democrat interest groups, and in no way an effort to help all Americans.
 Now, Americans are waking up to the truth that ObamaCare basically means that every time you are sick or injured, you will have a clerk from the Department of Motor Vehicles telling your doctor what he can and cannot  do.
 The American people already know that Mr. Obama’s plan to lower health costs while expanding coverage and bureaucracy is a myth, a promise of something that never was and never will be — a bureaucracy lowering costs in a free society. Either the costs go up or the free society goes away.
 These are perilous times. Mrs. Hillary Clinton, our Secretary of State, has given Iran the go-ahead to have nuclear weapons, an unqualified betrayal of the nation. Now, we face a devastating loss of freedom at home in health care. It will be joined by controls on our lives to “protect us” from global warming, itself largely a fraud if believed to be caused by man.
 Mr. Obama knows Americans are getting wise and will stop him if he delays at all in taking away our freedoms.
 There is his urgency and our opportunity. Once freedom is lost, America is lost. Wake up, beloved America.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/abortion_survivor/	Abortion Survivor’s Dramatic Appearance in the Colorado House of Representatives	Truth!				2015/03/17	"June 16, 2006 Planned Parenthood Celebration Jolted by Abortion Survivor by Ted Harvey, assistant minority leader, Colorado House
 She sings the anthem to applause, then her secret is revealed to stunned silence. I want to share with you an awesome experience I had in the Colorado House of Representatives on May 8. It is a humbling experience to look back and realize that God used me to play a role in His divine orchestration.
 I was leaving the House chambers for the weekend when our Democrat speaker of the House announced that the coming Monday would be the final day of this year’s General Assembly. He went on to state that there were still numerous resolutions on the calendar which we would need to be addressed prior to the summer adjournment. Interestingly, he specifically mentioned that one of the resolutions we would be hearing was being carried by the House Majority Leader Alice Madden, honoring the 90th anniversary of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.
 As a strong pro-life legislator I was disgusted by the idea that we would pass a resolution honoring this 90-year legacy of genocide. I drove home that night wondering what I could say that might pierce the darkness during the debate on this heinous resolution.
 On Saturday morning, I took my 8-year-old son up to the mountains to go white-water rafting. The trip lasted all day. As we were driving home, exhausted and hungry, I remembered that I had accepted an invitation to attend a fundraising dinner that night for a local pro-life organization. One of my most respected mentors had personally called me several weeks earlier and asked me to attend, so I knew I’d have to clean up and head over.
 After our meal, the executive director of the organization introduced the keynote speaker. I looked up and saw walking to the stage a handicapped young lady being assisted to the microphone by a young man holding a guitar.
 Her name was Gianna Jessen.
 Gianna said “Hello,” welcomed everyone, and then sang three of the most beautiful Christian songs I have ever heard.
 She then began to give her testimony. When her biological mother was 17 years old and seven and a half months pregnant, she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to have an abortion. As God would have it, the abortion failed and a beautiful 2-pound baby girl was brought into the world. Unfortunately, she was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors thought that she would never survive. The doctors were wrong.
 Imagine the timing! A survivor of a Planned Parenthood abortion arrived in town just days before the Colorado House of Representatives was to celebrate Planned Parenthood’s “wonderful” work. As I listened to Gianna’s amazing testimony, the Lord inspired me to ask her if she could stay in Denver until Monday morning so that I could introduce her on the floor of the House and tell her story. Perhaps she could even begin the final day’s session by singing our country’s national anthem!
 To my surprise she said she would seriously consider it. If she were to agree, she wanted her accompanying guitarist to stay as well. A lady standing in line behind me waiting to meet Gianna overheard our conversation and said that she would be willing to pay for the guitarist’s room. Gianna then said that she would think about it.
 As I was driving home from the banquet, my cell phone rang. It was Gianna, and she immediately said, “I’m in, let’s ruin this celebration.” Praise God!
 When Monday morning came, I awoke at 6 a.m. to write my speech before heading to the Capitol. As I wrote down the words, I could sense God’s help and I knew that this was going to be a powerful moment for the pro-life movement.
 Following a committee hearing, I rushed into the House chambers just as the opening morning prayer was about to be given. Between the prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, I wrote a quick note to the speaker of the House explaining that Gianna is an advocate for cerebral palsy. I took the note to the speaker and asked if I could have my friend open the last day of session by singing the national anthem. Without any hesitation the speaker took the microphone and said, “Before we begin, Representative Harvey has made available for us Gianna Jessen to sing the national anthem.”
 Gianna sang the most amazing rendition of The Star Spangled Banner that you could possibly imagine. Every person in the entire chamber was completely still, quiet and in awe of this frail young lady’s voice.
 Due to her cerebral palsy, Gianna often loses her balance, and shortly after starting to sing she grabbed my arm to stabilize herself, and I could tell that she was shaking. Suddenly, midway through the song, she forgot the words and began to hum and then said, “Please forgive me; I am so nervous.” She then immediately began singing again and every House member and every guest throughout the chambers began to sing along with her to give her encouragement and to lift her up.
 As I looked around the huge hall I listened to the unbelievable melody of Gianna’s voice being accompanied by a choir of over 100 voices. I had chills running all over my body, and I knew that I had just witnessed an act of God.
 As the song concluded the speaker of the House explained that Gianna has cerebral palsy and is an activist to bring awareness to the disease. “Let us give her a hand not only for her performance today, but also for her advocacy work,” he said. The chamber immediately exploded into applause — she had them all in the palm of her hand.
 The speaker then called the House to order, and we proceeded as usual to allow members to make any announcements or introductions of guests. For dramatic effect, I waited until I was the last person remaining before I introduced Gianna.
 As I waited for my turn, I nervously paced back and forth praying to God that he would give me the peace, confidence and the courage necessary to pull off what I knew would be one of the most dramatic and controversial moments of my political career.
 While I waited, a prominent reporter from one of the major Denver newspapers walked over to Gianna and told her that her rendition captured the spirit of the national anthem more powerfully than any she had ever heard before.
 Finally, I was the last person remaining. So, I proceeded to the microphone and began my speech.
 Members, I would like to introduce you to a new friend and hero of mine — her name is Gianna Jessen. She is visiting us today from Nashville, Tennessee, where she is an accomplished recording artist.
 She has cerebral palsy and was raised in foster homes before being adopted at the age of four  She was born prematurely and weighed only 2 pounds at birth. She remained in the hospital for almost three  months. A doctor once said she had a great will to live and that she fought for her life. Eventually she was able to leave the hospital and be placed in foster care.
 Because of her cerebral palsy, her foster mother was told
that it was doubtful that she would ever crawl or walk. She could not sit up independently. Through the prayers and dedication of her foster mother, she eventually learned to sit up, crawl, then stand. Shortly before her fourth birthday, she began to walk with leg braces and a walker.
She continued in physical therapy and after a total of four surgeries, she was able to walk without assistance.
 She still falls sometimes, but she says she has learned how to fall gracefully after falling for 29 years.
 Two years ago, she walked into a local health club and said she wanted a private trainer. At the time her legs could not lift 30 pounds. Today she can leg press 200 pounds. She became so physically fit that she began running marathons to raise money and awareness for cerebral palsy. She just returned last week from England where she ran in the London Marathon. It took her more than eight-and-a-half hours to complete. They were taking down the course by the time she made it to the finish line. But she made it, nonetheless. With bloody feet and aching joints, she finished the race.
Members would you help me recognize a modern-day hero — Gianna Jessen?
 At this point the chamber exploded into applause which lasted for 15-to-20 seconds. Gianna had touched their souls.
 Ironically, Alice Madden, the majority leader and sponsor of the Planned Parenthood resolution, walked over to Gianna and congratulated her.
 As the applause began to die down, I raised my hand to be recognized one more time. Mr. Speaker, members, if you would allow me just a few more moments I would appreciate your time.
 My name is Ted Harvey, not Paul Harvey, but, please, let me tell you the rest of the story. The cause of Gianna’s cerebral palsy is not because of some biological freak of nature, but rather the choice of her mother. You see when her biological mother was 17-years-old and 7-and-a-half months pregnant, she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to seek a late-term abortion. The abortionist performed a saline abortion on this 17-year-old girl. This procedure requires the injection of a high concentration of saline into the mother’s womb, which the fetus is then bathed in and swallows, which results in the fetus being burned to death, inside and out. Within 24 hours the results are normally an induced, still-born abortion.
 As Gianna can testify, the procedure is not always 100 percent effective. Gianna is an aborted late-term fetus who was born alive. The high concentration of saline in the womb for 24 hours resulted in a lack of oxygen to her brain and is the cause of her cerebral palsy. Members, today, we are going to recognize the 90th anniversary of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood…” BANG! The gavel came down.
 Just as I was finishing the last sentence of my speech — the climax of the morning — the speaker of the House gaveled me down and said, “Representative Harvey, I will allow you to continue your introduction, but not for the purposes of debating a measure now pending before the House.”
 At which point I said, “Mr. Speaker, I understand. I just wanted to put a face to what we are celebrating today.”
 Silence.
 Deafening silence.
 I then walked back to my chair shaking like a leaf. The Democrats wouldn’t look at me. They were fuming. It was beautiful. I have been in the Legislature for five tough years, and this made it all worthwhile.
 The House majority leader wouldn’t talk to me the rest of the day.
 Was it because I introduced an abortion survivor, or was it because we touched her soul? She could congratulate an inspirational cerebral palsy victim and advocate, but was outraged when she discovered that the person she congratulated was also an abortion survivor. The headline in The Denver Post the next day read “Abortion Jab Earns Rebuke.” The majority leader is quoted as saying, “I think it was amazingly rude to use a human being as an example of his personal politics.”
 Yes, Representative Madden, Gianna Jessen is a human being. She was when she was in her mother’s womb, and she was when she sang the national anthem on the floor of the Colorado House of Representatives.
 The paper went on to quote Gianna, stating she was glad I told her story. “We need to discuss the humanity of it. I’m glad to be able to speak up for children in the womb,” she said. “If abortion is about women’s rights, where were my rights?”
 All I can say is, “Glory to God!” He orchestrated it all, every minute of it, and I was so honored to have been chosen to play a part. May we all continue to be filled with and to fight for the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/8-levels-saul-alinksy/	Obama and the 8 Levels of Control by Saul Alinsky	Unproven!				2015/03/17	" All in a day’s work according to Obama who took advice and training from Saul Alinsky.
How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky
There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state. The first is the most important.
1) Healthcare  Control healthcare and you control the people
2) Poverty Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.
3) Debt Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.
4) Gun Control Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.
5) Welfare Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income)
6) Education Take control of what people read and listen to � take control of what children learn in school.
7) Religion  Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools
8) Class Warfare  Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.
Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States ?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/two-americas-lou-holtz/	Two Americas  Lou Holtz Nails it	 Inaccurate Attribution!				2015/03/17	" 
Two Americas – Lou Holtz nails it
The Democrats are right, there are two Americas. The America that works, and the America that doesn’t. The America that contributes, and the America that doesn’t. It’s not the haves and the have not’s, it’s the dos and the don’ts. Some people do their duty as Americans, obey the law, support themselves, contribute to society, and others don’t. That’s the divide in America. It’s not about income inequality, it’s about civic irresponsibility. It’s about a political party that preaches hatred, greed and victimization in order to win elective office. It’s about a political party that loves power more than it loves its country. That’s not invective, that’s truth, and it’s about time someone said it.
The politics of envy was on proud display a couple weeks ago when President Obama pledged the rest of his term to fighting “income inequality.” He noted that some people make more than other people, that some people have higher incomes than others, and he say that’s not just. That is the rationale of thievery. The other guy has it, you want it, Obama will take it for you. Vote Democrat. That is the philosophy that produced Detroit. It is the electoral philosophy that is destroying America. It conceals a fundamental deviation from American values and common sense because it ends up not benefiting the people who support it, but a betrayal. 
The Democrats have not empowered their followers, they have enslaved them in a culture of dependence and entitlement, of victim-hood and anger instead of ability and hope. The president’ premise –that you reduce income inequality by debasing the successful –seeks to deny the successful the consequences of their choices and spare the unsuccessful the consequences of their choices. Because, by and large, income variations in society is a result of different choices leading to different consequences. Those who choose wisely and responsibility have a far greater likelihood of success, while those who choose foolishly and irresponsibly have a far greater likelihood of failure. Success and failure usually manifest themselves in personal and family income. You choose to drop out of high school or to skip college – and you are apt to have a different outcome than someone who gets a diploma and pushes on with purposeful education. You have your children out of wedlock and life is apt to take one course; you have them within a marriage and life is apt to take another course. Most often in life our destination is determined by the course we take. 
My doctor, for example, makes far more than I do. There is significant income inequality between us. Our lives have had an inequality of outcome, but, our lives also have had an in equality of effort. While my doctor went to college and then devoted his young adulthood to medical school and residency, I got a job in a restaurant. He made a choice, I made a choice, and our choices led us to different outcomes. His outcome pays a lot better than mine. Does that mean he cheated and Barack Obama needs to take away his wealth? No, it means we are both free men in a free society where free choices lead to different outcomes. It is not inequality Barack Obama intends to take away, it is freedom. The freedom to succeed, and the freedom to fail. There is no true option for success if there is no true option for failure.
The pursuit of happiness means a whole lot less when you face the punitive hand of government if your pursuit brings you more happiness than the other guy. Even if the other guy sat on his arse and did nothing. Even if the other guy made a lifetime’s worth of asinine and short sighted decisions.
Barack Obama and the Democrats preach equality of outcome as a right, while completely ignoring inequality of effort. The simple Law of the Harvest – as ye sow, so shall ye reap – is sometimes applied as, “The harder you work, the more you get.” Obama would turn that upside down. Those who achieve are to be punished as enemies of society and those who fail are to be rewarded as wards of society. Entitlement will replace effort as the key to upward mobility in American society if Barack Obama gets his way.
He seeks a lowest common denominator society in which the government besieges the successful and productive to foster equality through mediocrity. He and his party speak of two Americas, and their grip on power is based on using the votes of one to sap the productivity of the other. America is not divided by the differences in our outcomes, it is divided by the differences in our efforts.
It is a false philosophy to say one man’s success comes about unavoidably as the result of another man’s victimization. What Obama offered was not a solution, but a separatism. He fomented division and strife, pitted one set of Americans against another for his own political benefit. That’s what socialists offer. Marxist class warfare wrapped up with a bow. Two Americas, coming closer each day to proving the truth to Lincoln’s maxim that a house divided against itself cannot stand. “Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.”

This is such a disgusting tragedy that could have easily been prevented!
“Rogue”U.S. General Arrested for Activating Special Forces Teams Ignoring Libya Stand-Down Order
RELATED UPDATE: Did you know that Obama Fires Top Admiral For Advocating Libyan Rescue?
The official story surrounding the events of September 11 2012 in Bengzahi Libya which left four Americans dead has now officially fallen apart.
After numerous flips and flops by the Obama administration which originally attempted to paint the incident as a Muslim outcry over an anti-Islamic video whistle blowers throughout the U.S. Government including within the White House, the State Department, national intelligence agencies and the U.S. military have made available stunning details that suggest not only did operational commanders have live visual and audio communications from drones overhead and intelligence assets on the ground but that some commanders within the military were prepared to go-it-alone after being told to “stand down.”
Africom commanding officer U.S. General Carter Ham after being ordered to essentially surrender control of the situation to alleged Al Queda terrorists and let Americans on the ground die made the unilateral decision to ignore orders from the Secretary of Defense and activated special operations teams at his disposal for immediate deployment to the area.
According to reports once the General went rogue he was arrested within minutes by his second in command and relieved of duty.
“(The) basic principle is that you don’t deploy forces into harm’s way without knowing what’s going on without having some real-time information about what’s taking place” Panetta told Pentagon reporters. “And as a result of not having that kind of information the commander who was on the ground in that area Gen. Ham Gen. Dempsey and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation.”
The information I heard today was that General Ham as head of Africom received the same e-mails the White House received requesting help/support as the attack was taking place. General Ham immediately had a rapid response unit ready and communicated to the Pentagon that he had a unit ready.
General Ham then received the order to stand down. His response was to screw it he was going to help anyhow. Within 30 seconds to a minute after making the move to respond his second in command apprehended General Ham and told him that he was now relieved of his command.
The question now is whether the American people will hold to account the chain of command responsible for leaving our people behind, fabricating a politically expedient story, and continuing to sell the now defunct lie(s) even after all of their variations of the story were found to be false and misleading.
A General who made the decision to assist diplomatic and intelligence assets on the ground has been arrested and will likely be retired or worse while those who ordered the removal of embassy security details and ordered U.S. Forces to stand-down are left to go on about their business and likely risk more American lives in the future.
In some circles the actions of those at the very top of the command structure during the Bengzahi attacks would be considered traitorous.

 Senators, 
 Your vote against an amendment to the Immigration Bill 1348, to make English America’s official language is astounding. On D-Day no less when we honor those that sacrificed in order to secure the bedrock character and principles of America. I can only surmise your vote reflects a loyalty to illegal aliens. 
I don’t much care where you come from, what your religion is, whether you’re black, white or some other color, male or female, democrat, republican or independent, but I do care when you’re a United States Senator, representing citizens of America and vote against English as the official language of the United States. 
Your vote reflects betrayal, political surrender, violates your pledge of allegiance, dishonors historical principle, rejects patriotism, borders on traitorous action and, in my opinion, makes you unfit to serve as a United States Senator… impeachment, recall, or other appropriate action is warranted. 
Worse, 4 of you voting against English as America’s official language are presidential candidates: Senator Biden, Senator Clinton, Senator Dodd, and Senator Obama. 
Those 4 Senators vying to lead America but won’t or don’t have the courage to cast a vote in favor of English as America’s official language when 91% of American citizens want English officially designated as our language. 
This is the second time in the last several months this list of Senators have disgraced themselves as political hacks… unworthy as Senators and certainly unqualified to serve as President of the United States. 
If America is as angry as I am, you will realize a back-lash so stunning it will literally rock you out of your panties… and preferably, totally out of the United States Senate.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dr-ben-carson-2016/	Dr. Ben Carson Considering White House Run	Truth!				2015/03/17	"The example sent to us below was from an article found on the  Newsmax.com website.
Ben Carson: ‘There Is a Fire Lit in Me to Save Our Country’ – By: Bill Hoffmann
Dr. Ben Carson says he has “a fire” inside him to rescue the United States from ruin — and he’s building a strong political network to lay the groundwork for a possible 2016 presidential run. “There certainly is a fire lit in me to save our country. I don’t know what my role will be in that. Only God knows that, but I’m certainly listening to the people,” Carson said Wednesday on “The Steve Malzberg Show” on Newsmax TV.
“I will be very attentive in November to see if people want a country that’s forever by the people or forever by the government.
“We’re putting an organization, USA First PAC, and working with American Legacy PAC and various organizations to make sure all the ground work is laid.”
Carson, former head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, said if he does run, his agenda will move “toward things that help America, not toward things that help a political party.” He said he has been talking to groups of people nationwide about their vision of the United States and what they are willing to do to make it a better place.
“That’s the key. What are you willing to do for it? Freedom is not free. It’s not a spectator’s sport. You have to roll your sleeves up. You have to get involved, otherwise you will lose it,” Carson said.
The renowned surgeon, an African American conservative who has never held a political office, has been testing the waters of political support over the past year. Carson also spoke about the shooting of a black youth by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo., and the subsequent rioting that has rocked the city of 21,000, saying he has been “very disappointed” with news coverage of the turmoil.

By Charlie Daniels www.charliedaniels.com
Mexican Standoff
I don’t know how everybody else feels about it, but to me I think Hispanic people in this country, legally or illegally, made a huge public relations mistake with their recent demonstrations.
I don’t blame anybody in the world for wanting to come to the United States of America, as it is a truly wonderful place. But when the first thing you do when you set foot on American soil is illegal it is flat out wrong and I don’t care how many lala land left heads come out of the woodwork and start trying to give me sensitivity lessons.
I don’t need sensitivity lessons, in fact I don’t have anything against Mexicans! I just have something against criminals and anybody who comes into this country illegally is a criminal and if you don’t believe it, try coming into America from a foreign country without a passport and see how far you get.
What disturbs me about the demonstrations is that it’s tantamount to saying, “I am going to come into your country even if it means breaking your laws and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
It’s an “in your face” action and speaking just for me I don’t like it one little bit and if there were a half dozen pairs of gonads in Washington bigger than English peas it wouldn’t be happening.
Where are you, you bunch of lilly livered, pantywaist, forked tongued, sorry excuses for defenders of The Constitution? Have you been drinking the water out of the Potomac again?
And even if you pass a bill on immigration it will probably be so pork laden and watered down that it won’t mean anything anyway. Besides, what good is an other law going to do when you won’t enforce the ones on the books now?
And what ever happened to the polls guys? I thought you folks were the quintessential finger wetters. Well you sure ain’t paying any attention to the polls this time because somewhere around eighty percent of Americans want something done about this mess, and mess it is and getting bigger everyday.
This is no longer a problem, it is a dilemma and headed for being a tragedy. Do you honestly think that what happened in France with the Muslims can’t happen here when the businesses who hire these people finally run out of jobs and a few million disillusioned Hispanics take to the streets?
If you, Mr. President, Congressmen and Senators, knuckle under on this and refuse to do something meaningful it means that you care nothing for the kind of country your children and grandchildren will inherit.
But I guess that doesn’t matter as long as you get re-elected. Shame on you.
One of the big problems in America today is that if you have the nerve to say anything derogatory about any group of people (except Christians) you are going to be screamed at by the media and called a racist, a bigot and anything else they can think of to call you.
Well I’ve been pounded by the media before and I’m still rockin’ and rollin’ and when it comes to speaking the truth I fear not. And the truth is that the gutless, gonadless, milksop politicians are just about to sell out the United States of America because they don’t have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the face reality.
And reality is that we would never allow any other group of people to have 12 million illegals in this country and turn a round and say, ”Oh it’s ok, ya’ll can stay here if you’ll just allow us to slap your wrist.”
And I know that some of you who read this column are saying “Well what’s wrong with that?”
I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it. These people could be from Mars as far as we know. We don’t know who they are, where they are or what they’re up to and the way the Congress is going we’re not going to.
Does this make sense? Labor force you say? We already subsidize corporate agriculture as it is, must we subsidize their labor as well?
If these people were from Haiti would we be so fast to turn a blind eye to them or if they were from Somalia or Afghanistan? I think not.
All the media shows us are pictures of hard working Hispanics who have crossed the border just to try to better their life. They don’t show you pictures of the Feds rounding up members of MS 13, the violent gang who came across the same way the decent folks did. They don’t tell you about the living conditions of the Mexican illegals some fat cat hired to pick his crop.
I want to make two predictions
No. 1: This situation is going to grow and fester until it erupts in violence on our streets while the wimps in Washington drag their toes in the dirt and try to figure how many tons of political hay they can make to the acre.
No 2: Somebody is going to cross that border with some kind of weapon of mass destruction and set it off in a major American city after which there will be a backlash such as this country has never experienced and the Capitol building in Washington will probably tilt as Congressmen and Senators rush to the other side of the issue.
I don’t know about you but I would love to see just one major politician stand up and say, “I don’t care who I make mad and I don’t care how many votes I lose, this is a desperate situation and I’m going to lead the fight to get it straightened out.”
I don’t blame anybody for wanting to come to America, but if you don’t respect our immigration laws why should you respect any others.
And by the way, this is America, and our flag has stars and stripes. Please get that other one out of my face.
Pray for our troops
What do you think?
God Bless America

 The US has entered into a contract with a real estate firm to sell 56 buildings that currently house U.S. Post Offices. The government has decided it no longer needs these buildings, many of which are located on prime land in towns and cities across the country. 
The sale of these properties will fetch billions of dollars and a handsome 6% commission to the company handling the sales. That company belongs to a man named Richard Blum. Who is Richard Blum you ask? Why the husband of Senator Dianne Feinstein, that’s who. What a bunch of crooks we have running this country! 
 Senator Feinstein and her husband, Richard Blum, stand to make a fortune. His firm, C.R. I., is the sole real estate company offering these properties for sale. Of course, C.R.I. will be making a 6% commission on the sale of each and every one of these postal properties. 
 All of these properties that are being sold are all fully paid for. They were purchased with U.S. taxpayers’ dollars, and they are allowed free and clear by the U.S.P.S. The only cost to keep them is the cost to actually keep the doors open and the heat and lights on. The United States Postal Service doesn’t even have to pay property taxes on these subject properties. Would you sell your house just because you couldn’t afford to pay the electric bill? Well, the Post Office is. 
 How does a powerful U.S. Senator from San Francisco manage to get away with such a sweet deal? A powerful United States Senator’s husband is standing by, all ready to make millions from a U.S. taxpayer funded enterprise. 
 No one in the mainstream media is even raising an eyebrow over his 6% commission on the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of quasi-public assets.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-3rd-term/	Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run  


Washington, DC — President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term. “I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever,” Obama told reporters at a press conference this morning. “We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting.”
 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN he does not agree with Obama and his announcement. “This defies everything the Constitution stands for,” Paul said. “We can not let this man have a third term.”
 In the history of this country only two presidents have served more than two terms, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D, Roosevelt. The major problem for Obama when he runs in 2016, is the 22nd Amendment. In short, the 22nd Amendment states, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice…”
 The U.S. Constitution does make an exception in the 22nd Amendment though: “This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.” This means Obama’s third term presidential run is only valid if he receives 75% approval from the Congress.
 A bill to abolish the 22nd Amendment was recently introduced into Congress by New York Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano and is gaining popularity. This is exactly the kind of news that makes an Obama 2016 Presidential run possible.
 Paul Horner who is a spokesman for the Obama Administration told reporters how amazing this news is for the country. “Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016 and then we’ll all be able to enjoy this great man for another four years. Things could not get any better for the American people. I’m so stoked!”

Via my card-carrying pissed-off-American mom: 
H.L. Mencken (born 1880 – died 1956) was a journalist, satirist, critic, and Democrat. He wrote the editorial below while working for the Baltimore Evening Sun, which appeared in the July 26, 1920 edition.
“As democracy is perfected, the office of the President represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.”

Click Here to read AFA’s review of Senate Bill 1 (Section 220).
The new Democratic Senate thinks that if it can keep you from getting information—which is what Senate Bill 1 (Section 220) would do—then it will not be getting e-mails and phone calls from you.
Senators favoring this bill are simply tired of hearing from you. That is the bottom line. They don’t want to hear from you. They don’t want you to be informed. They want to silence you. How? By simply keeping you from receiving information that AFA provides.
I know that language is strong, but Senate Bill 1 (Section 220) will do exactly what I’ve said.
Take Action
1. Send an e-mail to your two senators now!
2. Call your two senators at 202-224-3121. (Simply ask for one senator. Then call the other one at the same number. Ask your senators to vote against Senate Bill 1 (Section 220).
3. Please forward this to your friends and family. It is vitally important that they know what members of the Senate are trying to do.
4. Print this information, and share it with members in your Sunday School class and church and urge them to send an e-mail and call.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/lynch-holder-connection/	Connection Between AG Nominee Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
By Dr. Orly Taitz, ESQ 
I started investigating Loretta Lynch, Obama’s pick for Attorney General and immediately could see an interesting connection. I read an article stating that when Loretta Lynch started Harvard, she co-founded an African-American sorority. There was only one other girl in this sorority, Sharon Malone. The name rang a bell. 
The name of the wife of AG Holder is Sharon Malone, she is the sister of a known civil rights leader Vivien Malone -Jones (one of 2 black students who enrolled in all white University of Alabama). 


I checked the age: both were born in 1959 and both went to Harvard at the same time. There were very few African American students in Harvard in 1977-1981, so I am rather certain that Loretta Lynch is an old college friend of Sharon Malone, the wife of the current AG Eric Holder. 


Why this connection is important? Holder will be investigated by Congress for totally lawless gun trafficking to Mexican drug cartels in Fast and Furious, IRS scandal, VA scandal, DOJ, NSA, EPA, FEC and other scandals. Most importantly, Holder covered up Obama’s use of a stolen CT Social Security number of Harrison J. Bounel 042-68-4425 and Obama’s use of bogus IDs. 


It seems that a long time college friend of Holder’s wife was picked up as a gate keeper to continue all of the cover up by Holder and shield Holder and Obama from criminal prosecution.

Those who compare the bare-chested conqueror of the Crimea with the metrosexual ruler of the United States and find our emperor weak to the point of deserving ridicule miss the essential strength of President Obama. 
It’s no ordinary weakling who can turn a once-respected country into an international joke; reduce Congress to a gaggle of sniveling sycophants; turn the world’s finest medical system into a failed third-rate socialist nightmare with a stroke of his pen; shatter our Constitution without attempted recourse by the sons and daughters of frontiersmen and pioneers whose blood was used to write that inspired document; and turn the people of our once-united states into a herd of competing minorities who, like suckling pigs, are each afraid to lose his place on the government teat should he raise his voice to protest the ruin of our country. 
So don’t denigrate the nonentity ruler who has overcome his uncertain ancestry and ludicrous incompetence to do what no other king or dictator has been able to do in our 237-year history: He has destroyed America.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/lamm/	"""American Suicide"" a speech by Former Colorado Governor RichardLamm"	Truth!				2015/03/17	"
  If  you read anything today, read  this.
          AMERICAN  SUICIDE         Wherever you stand, please take the time to  read this; it ought to  scare the pants off  you!
          We know Dick  Lamm as the former Governor of Colorado (Democrat). In that context his  thoughts  are particularly poignant. Recently there was  an immigration overpopulation conference in Washington,  DC,  filled to capacity by many of America’s finest minds and leaders.   A brilliant college professor by  the name of Victor Davis   Hansen  talked about his latest book, “Mexifornia,”  explaining how  immigration – both legal and illegal was destroying  the entire state of California He said it would  march across the  country until it destroyed all vestiges of The American  Dream.
          Moments  later, former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm stood up and gave a stunning  speech  on how to destroy America. The audience sat spellbound  as he described eight methods for the  destruction of the United  States. He said, “If you believe that America is too smug,  too  self-satisfied, too rich, then let’s destroy America. It  is not that hard to do. No nation in  history has survived the  ravages of time. Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations  rise  and fall and that ‘An autopsy of history would show that  all great nations commit  suicide.'”
          “Here is  how they do it,” Lamm said: “First, to destroy America, turn America  into a bilingual or  multi-lingual and bicultural country.” History  shows tha! t no nat ion can survive the tension, conflict,  and  antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures It is a blessing  for an individual to  be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a  society  to be bilingual. The historical scholar,  Seymour  Lipset, put it this way: “The histories of  bilingual and bi-cultural societies that do not assimilate  are  histories of turmoil, tension, and tragedy.”  Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, and Lebanon all face crises  of  national existence in which minorities press for autonomy,  if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus  have divided. Nigeria  suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficult times  with Basques, Bretons, and  Corsicans.”
          Lamm  went on: Second, to destroy America, “Invent ‘multiculturalism’ and  encourage immigrants  to maintain their culture. Make it an article  of belief that all cultures are equal. That there are  no  cultural differences. Make it an article of faith that the Black and  Hispanic dropout rates are due  solely to prejudice and  discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out of  bounds.
          Third, “We  could make the United States an ‘Hispanic Quebec’ without much effort.  The key is to  celebrate diversity rather than unity. As  Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently:  “The  apparent success of our own multiethnic and multicultural  experiment might have been achieved  not by tolerance but by  hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentricity  and  what it meant to be an American, we are left with only  tolerance and pluralism to hold us together.”  Lamm said, “I would  encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would!  replace the  melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl  metaphor. It is important to ensure that we have  various  cultural subgroups living in America enforcing  their differences rather than as Americans, emphasizing  their  similarities.”
           “Fourth, I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least  educated. I would add a  second underclass, unassimilated,  undereducated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have  this  second underclass have a 50% dropout rate from  high school.”
           “My fifth point for destroying America would be to get big foundations  and business to give these  efforts lots of money. I would invest in  ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult  of  ‘Victimology.’ I would get all minorities to think that  their lack of success was the fault of the  majority. I would start  a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority  population.”
          “My  sixth plan for America’s downfall would include dual citizenship, and  promote divided  loyalties I would celebrate diversity over unity.  I would stress differences rather than similarities.  Diverse  people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other- that is, when they  are not  killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or  stable society is against most historical precedent.  People  undervalue the unity it takes to keep a  nation together.  Look at the ancient Greeks. The  Greeks  believed that they belonged to the same race;  they possessed a common Language and literature; and  they  worshipped the same Gods. All Greece took part in the  Olympic games. A common enemy, Persia,  threatened their liberty. !  Yet all these bonds were not strong enough to overcome two factors:  local  patriotism and geographical conditions that  nurtured political divisions. Greece fell. “E. Pluribus  Unum”  — from many, one. In that historical reality, if we put  the emphasis on the ‘Pluribus’ instead of the  ‘Unum,’ we will  balkanize America assuredly  as Kosovo.”
           “Next to last, I would place all subjects off limits; make it taboo to  talk about anything  against the cult of ‘diversity.’ I would find a  word similar to ‘heretic’ in the 16th century – that  stopped  discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like ‘racist’ or ‘xenophobe’  halt discussion and  debate. Having made America a  bi-lingual/bicultural country, having established multiculturalism,  having  the large foundations fund the doctrine  of ‘victimology,’ I would next make it impossible to enforce our  immigration laws. I would develop a mantra: That because immigration  has been good for America, it must always be good. I would make  every
individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative  impact of millions of  them.”
          In the last  minute of his speech, Governor Lamm wiped his brow. Profound silence  followed.  Finally he said, “Lastly, I would censor  Victor Hanson Davis’s book “Mexifornia.”  His book  is dangerous.  It exposes the plan to destroy America. If you  feel America deserves to be destroyed, don’t read that  book.”
          There was no  applause. A chilling fear quietly rose like an ominous cloud above  every  attendee at the conference. Every American in that room  knew that everything Lamm enumerated was  proceeding methodically,  quietly, da! rkly, yet pervasively across the United States  today.  Discussion is being suppressed. Over 100 languages are  ripping the foundation of our educational system  and national  cohesiveness.  Even barbaric cultures that practice female genital  mutilation are growing  as we celebrate ‘diversity.’  American  jobs are vanishing into the Third World as corporations  create  a Third World in America – take note of California and other states –  to date, ten million  illegal aliens and growing fast. It is  reminiscent of George Orwell’s book “1984.”  In that  story,  three slogans are engraved in the Ministry of  Truth building: “War is peace,” “Freedom is slavery,”  and  “Ignorance is  strength.”
          Governor  Lamm walked back to his seat. It dawned on everyone at the conference  that our nation  and the future of this great democracy is deeply  in trouble and worsening fast. If we don’t get  this  immigration monster stopped within three years, it will  rage like a California wildfire and destroy  everything in its path  especially The American Dream.  If you care for and love our  country as I  do, take the time to pass this on just as I did  for you.
           NOTHING is exactly what will happen if  you don’t!
           [ Author of the book ‘Mexifornia’ is  Victor Davis Hanson  ]

https://www.truthorfiction.com/potus-breakdown-092413/	President Obama Reported Sedated After Emotional Breakdown	Fiction!  & Satire!				2015/03/17	"Meltdown in Washington: President Obama Reported Sedated Following Emotional Breakdown
By Nigel J. Covington III
Editor-in-Chief
Late this afternoon White House insiders leaked information stating the president has suffered a mental breakdown and is presently resting and under a doctors care. This afternoon the National Report received three calls on our nationwide hot tip line (206) 222-1975. Two of the three callers are insiders known to the National Report to be reliable confidential informants.
The caller unknown to this publication is a low level employee who could only state that there was some kind of a medical emergency involving President Obama. The other two callers known to us are both support personnel within the Obama administration. Both confirmed this week has been a political disaster for the president and this has taken a tremendous toll on him.
Russian President Vladimir Putin Has Recently Shamed Obama on the World Stage
Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin derailed the president’s plan to bomb Syria and bury the U.S. in another war the people want nothing to do with and can ill afford to pay for. Putin negotiated a deal with Syria for control over its chemical weapons providing a peaceful resolution to a certain US attack. With the world watching Obama was forced to stand down causing him a great deal of shame and public embarrassment.
Before Putin extended the olive branch of diplomacy to resolve the Syrian crisis, he also agreed to grant asylum to Edward Snowden, the man who stole US secret documents that exposed the NSA secret program already underway and approved by President Obama to spy on all US citizens. Not only did Snowden expose the top secret NSA program to the world, he escaped US authorities in China and arrived in Russia where he repeatedly bitch-slapped the president by releasing more US secrets to the media.
Safely in the arms of Mother Russia Snowden, showed the world people how helpless and weak the Obama administration is at being utter failures at diplomacy, tact and statesmanship. While Putin and Obama were engaged in “negotiations” over Snowden’s extradition, Snowden and Putin were engaged in conversation about Snowden’s defecting to Russia.
Whistle-blower Edward Snowden Exposed Obama-NSA scandal
In one of the most crippling moments of President Obama’s tenure Putin cut a deal with Snowden for asylum giving the Russian president tons of other US secrets. Edward Snowden now lives safely beyond the reach of Obama’s dirty scandal ridden administration who would’ve imprisoned or killed Snowden without a trial clearly disregarding all of Snowden’s civil liberties and denying him the opportunity to explain his actions before a court of law who would determine Snowden’s fate… not Obama. Then Putin told Obama ‘no’ on Snowden’s extradition completely shaming the president in front of the world.
In the past couple weeks the big winners on the world stage have been Syria, Russia, Snowden and Putin; all at the expense of America’s impotent and fraudulent president.
Remember what Obama “sold” the American people in his 2008 bid for the presidency? Obama the “agent of revolution” guaranteed “change” instead he lied to everyone by promising the “most transparent” government – “no special interest” – “a new way of doing business” – “most honest” – “most righteous” – “the new beginning” – then there was the abortion of Obama’s world tour… what a national mortification. And today how many of these promises has the president kept?
President Obama – Epic Failure Shames America
Then today’s Gallup poll results have been absolutely devastating for the president and the Democratic party. Obama’s approval rating dropped to the lowest in presidential history, and support from the Democratic Party plummeted more than 25% from this time last year.
Our sources confirm late this afternoon a doctor was summoned to the oval office and remained with the president for about a half-hour. When the doctor emerged he was heard to say the president needed rest and would be sedated once he was moved to his bed. The White House has remained silent and has yet to make a statement publicly.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/osteen-obama/	Joel Osteen Endorses President Obama	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
Joel Osteen, Pastor of the biggest congregation in America, Lakewood Church, appears to be an Obama fan, despite the fact that Obama’s agenda goes against everything true Christians believe. Those of us who are intelligent and observant were not really surprised, as we have known for a long time that Osteen’s “I’m okay, you’re okay” milk toast sermons are far from Bible-based and do not reflect in any way the beliefs of his father, John Osteen, who started Lakewood Church and preached the uncompromising message of Christ for multiple decades before his death in 1999. Joel Osteen, however he may have started out, is currently nothing more than a progressive in Christian’s clothing.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rjl03SrAYE
 Anyone calling President B. Hussein Obama a Christian is a curious thing, as Obama himself no longer even tries to make this claim. In addition, President Obama has stated that we are not a Christian nation and that the Bible is “not adequate for modern life.” He has not yet offered any criticism of the Koran, however. Maybe he feels the violence it promotes ISappropriate for today’s modern world.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-mystery/	Obama is the Mystery of the Century	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
MYSTERY OF THE CENTURY 
This is a very interesting read. 


This came from a union guy in Chicago who didn’t vote for Obama. Very, very interesting perspective that I never thought of in this light. It will be interesting to see what they put in his “Presidential Library” about his early years when he is out of office. In a country where we take notice of many, many facets of our public figures’ lives, doesn’t seem odd that there’s so little we know about our current president, Barack Obama. 


For example, we know that Andrew Jackson ‘s wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery; Abe Lincoln never went to school; Jack Kennedy wore a back brace; Harry Truman played the piano. 
As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single humanizing fact about the history of our own president. 


We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama; that document managing has been spectacularly successful. 


There are however, several additional oddities in Obama’s history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue. 


One other interesting thing… There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found ?  


It’s interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up. The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his 
campaign, certainly would in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all 
know about JFK’s magnetism, that McCain was no monk and quite a few details about Palin’s courtship and even her athletic prowess Joe 
Biden’s aneurisms are no secret; look at Cheney and Clinton, we all know about their heart problems. Certainly Wild Bill Clinton’s exploits 
before and during his White House years, were well known. That’s why it’s so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, “He was soooo 
shy…” or “What a great dancer…” 


It’s virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow. 
Who was the best man at his wedding? Start there. Then check groomsmen. 


Then get the footage of the graduation ceremony. Has anyone talked to the professors? It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or 
taught him or lived with him.  


When did he meet Michele, and how? Are there photos there? Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc. for their library, 
etc. What has he released? And who in hell voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010? Doesn’t this make you wonder? 


Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from President Obama’s past saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc?? 
Not one person has ever come forward from his past. 
It certainly is very, very strange… 


This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man. Have you 
seen a movie named “The Manchurian Candidate” 


As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face; someone will remember we were the 
clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about us. 


George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in 
their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia — 
the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him. 


He is such a great orator; why doesn’t anyone in Obama’s college class remember him? Why won’t he allow Columbia to release his records? 


Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University …. 


Looking for evidence of Obama’s past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been 
there… but none remembered him. 


Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama, “I don’t know a 
single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don’t have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever.” 


Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of ’83 Political Science, and says, “You don’t get more exact or closer than 
that. Never met him in my life, don’t know anyone who ever met him. At the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be 
the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class 
notes, who’s kind of the, as we say in New York , ‘the macha’ who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him.” 


Obama’s photograph does not appear in the school’s yearbook and Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia , 
provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia . 


Some other interesting questions: 


Why was Obama’s law license inactivated in 2002? 
it is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam. 


Why was Michelle’s law license inactivated by court order? 
We understand that was forced to avoid fraud charges. 


It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama but 27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias connected to him. 
The Social Security number he uses now originated in Connecticut where he is never reported to have lived. And was originally registered to anothe
r man 
(Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut, who died in Hawaii while on vacation there. As we all know Social Security Numbers are only issued ‘once, they are not reused’ 


No wonder all his records are sealed… 
Please continue sending this out to everyone. Somewhere, someone had to know him in school…before he “reorganized” Chicago & burst upon the Scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention.

Obama The Patriot – Removes American Flag From His Plane
The Patriot Room
Posted on Tuesday, July 22, 2008 8:11:07 AM
Barack Obama recently finished a $500,000 total overhaul of his 757. And as part of the new design, he decided to remove the American flag from the tail…

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-snap/	President Obama Snaps at Military Brass	 Unproven!				2015/03/17	" In a fit of rage, Obama snaps at U.S. military brass: “Don’t you dare try and paint all of Islam with the same brush” Showing his Muslim stripes, Obama threw a hissy fit and stomped out of a Pentagon meeting about the bombing campaign against ISIS over remarks allegedly tying the Islamic State ( ISIS ) to Islam. His tantrum reportedly took place in the afternoon of last week just prior to the president’s departure to Camp David. It was an informal briefing on the expanded bombing campaigns to take place in both Syria and Iraq . Halfway through the already very brief briefing, President Obama stood up clearly agitated, and walked  out of the room. The casually dressed Obama returned to the briefing moments later with a senior adviser alongside him, though his mood continued to indicate he was still very upset. The senior adviser made a couple pointed remarks to the Pentagon representatives, reminded them the president had already had a very busy day, and then both she  and the president once again left the room. Within seconds, Barack Obama returned again to the just concluded briefing, pointing at the still seated Pentagon staff and indicating how “inappropriate” it was to “try and  paint all of Islam with the same brush.” The president repeated similar remarks, his mood going from agitation to outrage. His voice carried to several other West Wing offices. The senior adviser, who did not originally return with the president into the briefing, suddenly re-appeared alongside him, as well as the president’s personal aide. She  was smiling, and telling everyone “we’re done here” which she repeated several times and then led the president back out into the hallway.

by Rich Carroll
Copy this article. You will need researched material to mail your liberal friends and/or relatives.
Mr. Hope and Change wants to create a nation humbled; humiliated, casting-aside capitalism and individual freedoms for one where “we the people” are government controlled. This would be a system that genuflects mediocrity, steals personal aspiration and opportunity, and punishes those who strive to succeed.
A gallon of regular gasoline the day Obama was inaugurated was $1.79 on average in the U.S. Today that price is $3.59, a 100.6% increase. The number of food stamp recipients has risen since Obama took office from 31,983,716 to 43,200,878, a 35.1% jump. Long term unemployment soared 146.2% during the same 32 month period from 2,600,000 to 6,400,000. Staggering “hope and change” isn’t it?
American citizens living in poverty have risen 9.5% from 39,800,000 to 43,600,000, and the number of unemployed has jumped almost 25% from 11,616,000 to 14,485,000 as of August 31, 2011. The number of unemployed blacks has risen from 12.6% at the end of George Bush’s term to 15.8% today, a 25.4% increase, and finally, our national debt is up 34.4% from 10.627 trillion to 14,278 trillion *
Keep these figures in mind as we recount the number of “firsts” for this presidency:
First President to refuse to show a valid birth certificate.
First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner.
First President to have a social security number from a state he has never lived in.
First President to preside over a cut to the credit rating of the United States .
First President to violate the War Powers Act.
First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
First President to defy a Federal Judges court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.
First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party.
First President to spend a trillion dollars on shovel-ready jobs and later admit there was no such thing as shovel-ready jobs.
First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.
First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.
First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S. , including those with criminal convictions.
First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees.
First President to terminate Americas ability to put a man in space.
First President to encourage racial discrimination and intimidation at polling places.
First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.
First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it.
First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly speak-out on the reasons for their rate increases.
First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state they are allowed to locate a factory.
First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (Az, WI, OH, IN)
First President to withdraw an existing coal permit that had been properly issued years ago.
First President to fire an inspector general of Ameri-corps for catching one of his friends in a corruption case.
First President to appoint 45 Czars to replace elected officials in his office.
First President to golf 73 separate times in his first two and a half years in office.
First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records.
First President to win a Nobel Peace Prize for doing NOTHING to earn it.
First President to coddle American enemies while alienating Americas allies.
First President to publicly bow to Americas enemies while refusing to salute the U.S. Flag.
First President to go on multiple global apology tours.
First President to go on 17 lavish vacations, including date nights and Wednesday evening White House parties for his friends, paid for by the taxpayer.
First President to refuse to wear the U.S. Flag lapel pin.
First President to have 22 personal servants (taxpayer funded) for his wife.
First President to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000.00 a year at taxpayer expense.
First President to repeat “the Holy Qur’an tells us,” and openly admit “the early morning call of the Azan (Islamic call to worship) is the most beautiful sound on earth.”
Remember that 32 months of Obama White House we the people have accumulated national debt at a rate more than 27 times as fast as during the rest of our nation’s entire history, as the Obama’s plan their next extravagant vacation to the Indonesian Island nation of Bali .

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-debt-limit/	Barack Obama Quote Against Raising the Debt Limit	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
The Quote of the Decade: 
“The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America ‘s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, ‘the buck stops here.’ Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.”

No He Can’t By Anne Wortham  


Fellow Americans, 
Please know: I am black; I grew up in the segregated South. I did not vote for Barack Obama; I wrote in Ron Paul’s name as my choice for president. Most importantly, I am not race conscious. I do not require a black president to know that I am a person of worth, and that life is worth living. I do not require a black president to love the ideal of America . 


I cannot join you in your celebration. I feel no elation. There is no smile on my face. I am not jumping with joy. There are no tears of triumph in my eyes. For such emotions and behavior to come from me, I would have to deny all that I know about the requirements of human flourishing and survival – all that I know about the history of the United States of America , all that I know about American race relations, and all that I know about Barack Obama as a politician. I would have to deny the nature of the “change” that Obama asserts has come to America . Most importantly, I would have to abnegate my certain understanding that you have chosen to sprint down the road to serfdom that we have been on for over a century. I would have to pretend that individual liberty has no value for the success of a human life. I would have to evade your rejection of the slender reed of capitalism on which your success and mine depend. I would have to think it somehow rational that 94 percent of the 12 million blacks in this country voted for a man because he looks like them (that blacks are permitted to play the race card), and that they were joined by self-declared “progressive” whites who voted for him because he doesn’t look like them. I would have to be wipe my mind clean of all that I know about the kind of people who have advised and taught Barack Obama and will fill posts in his administration – political intellectuals like my former colleagues at the Harvard University ‘s Kennedy School of Government. 
I would have to believe that “fairness” is the equivalent of justice. I would have to believe that man who asks me to “go forward in a new spirit of service, in a new service of sacrifice” is speaking in my interest. I would have to accept the premise of a man that economic prosperity comes from the “bottom up,” and who arrogantly believes that he can will it into existence by the use of government force. I would have to admire a man who thinks the standard of living of the masses can be improved by destroying the most productive and the generators of wealth. 


Finally, Americans, I would have to erase from my consciousness the scene of 125,000 screaming, crying, cheering people in Grant Park, Chicago irrationally chanting “Yes We Can!” Finally, I would have to wipe all memory of all the times I have heard politicians, pundits, journalists, editorialists, bloggers and intellectuals declare that capitalism is dead – and no one, including especially Alan Greenspan, objected to their assumption that the particular version of the anti-capitalistic mentality that they want to replace with their own version of anti-capitalism is anything remotely equivalent to capitalism. 


So you have made history, Americans. You and your children have elected a black man to the office of the president of the United States , the wounded giant of the world. The battle between John Wayne and Jane Fonda is over – and that Fonda won. Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern must be very happy men. Jimmie Carter, too. And the Kennedys have at last gotten their Kennedy look-a-like. The self-righteous welfare statists in the suburbs can feel warm moments of satisfaction for having elected a black person. So, toast yourselves: 60s countercultural radicals, 80s yuppies and 90s bourgeois bohemians. Toast yourselves, Black America. Shout your glee Harvard, Princeton , Yale, Duke, Stanford, and Berkeley. You have elected not an individual who is qualified to be president, but a black man who, like the pragmatist Franklin Roosevelt, promises to – Do Something! You now have someone who has picked up the baton of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. But you have also foolishly traded your freedom and mine – what little there is left – for the chance to feel good. There is nothing in me that can share your happy obliviousness.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/taitz-pelosi-response/	An Answer from Dr. Orly Taitz to Nancy Pelosi	Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	"Orly Taitz is both a doctor and an attorney and she received an e-mail from Nancy Pelosi. Taitz is an attorney leading 7 cases challenging Barack Obama due to his use of a stolen CT SSN 042-68-4425 issued to Harry Bounel and his use of a fabricated Selective Service Registration and fabricated birth certificate. Taitz has been receiving lately unsolicited e-mails from Valerie Jarett and Nancy Pelosi.
Taitz is posting a part of a lengthy e-mail. Pelosi writes about a young woman, who graduated from College, and as an adult could no longer stay on her father’s health insurance. According to her mother this young lady decided to save money by weaning herself of insulin, fell into a coma and died.
Pelosi goes on writing that cases like this are a reason, why we should support Obama-care.
Here is a response from Dr. Taitz:
“Nancy, I am sorry that this young person passed away, however it happened not because there is something wrong with the country, but because of the girl’s unbelievable stupidity.
I posted below prices on prescription medication. Walmart provided $4 for a month worth of medication for most medications. Link below shows $24 per month for a total supply for Insulin for a month. It is unbelievable that a college graduate could not afford $24 per month for a life saving medication. And even if she could not afford it, she could apply for Medicaid and get it for free. And where were her parents, siblings, who could give her $24 per month?
If she could not pay $24 for a life saving medication, how did she pay for all her other needs, such as rent, phone, car, food, clothing? We have welfare for indigent to cover all of these needs if they are indigent and have no family which can help them, if they fall on hard times. Moreover, this girl could simply get a job. The most basic job at McDonalds could give her enough money to pay for the most basic needs, but as a college graduate, she could clearly find something better than McDonalds.
When I came to this country as an immigrant, I had to pass the boards, so I worked as an assistant and assisted other doctors, cleaned their offices after patients, even cleaned the bathrooms in their offices and took out trash, I did what needed to be done in order to make a living until I pass the boards. When I gave birth to my three sons, I worked and together with my husband paid off all the bills for labor and delivery, for my care and for the pediatric care of our children.
Example, that you brought forward, does not exemplify a failure of our health system, it is a failure of our education system, where instead of teaching young people some basic skills to start their lives, the schools are brainwashing the young people with socialist-communist garbage, anything and everything, but basic life skills. It shows that in many instances we no longer have responsible parenting: parents should be there teaching their children basic life skills: when you graduate from high school or college start going on interviews, take a low paying job until you can find a better paying job, live with your parents until you can afford to live on your own, have open lines of communication with your parents and turn to them in a time of need.
It is time for us to take care of ourselves, of our families, not acquiesce to Obama-Pelosi Ponzi schemes, which already robbed 5-7 million Americans of their insurances, which they liked, severed their relationship with the doctors that they trusted with their care. The number of cancelled policies is expected to rise to estimated 129 million. Obama’s pathological lying and scheming will ultimately lead to cancellation of most if not all existing policies. Millions of Americans are now seeing their hours cut from 40 to 29, as employees cannot afford Obama-care and refuse to be a part of Obama- scheme. Further, Obama-care will rob families of 3.9% of their house sales as an additional tax. This Ponzi scheme is exempted from anti-kickback provisions and will lead to enormous bribery and corruption. As a matter of fact, 700 million taxpayer dollars paid for a web site, which does not even work properly and run by Michele Obama’s girl friend, is a suspect of enormous kickbacks and bribery.
So, Nancy, as a doctor and a lawyer, I am telling you: stop scaring people, stop being a part of this great big Obama lie. Time for you to join the Republicans and call for the repeal of Obama-care, which is actually an Obama-tax. Further on, you should join Republicans in a call for an impeachment of Obama for multiple counts of egregious fraud on American people, not only fraud in Obama-care promises, but also fraud in usurping the U.S. Presidency while using a stolen CT social Security number 042-68-4425, which was assigned to Harry Bounel, as well as of fabricated IDs. And while you are at it, you should call for an impeachment of the Attorney General Eric Holder, who aided and abetted Obama in this RICO scheme to cover up theft of the franchise of the U.S. Presidency by Obama through Obama’s assertion of identity and legitimacy for presidency with stolen and fabricated IDs.
With regards,
Dr. Orly Taitz, ESQ

Rand Paul’s Summer Break
We’ve heard all about Obama’s vacations, but not much about KY Senator Rand Paul’s summer break.
He and a partner teamed up to do pro bono eye surgeries for the poor.
People who came to the surgery center “legally blind or much worse” were all seeing before they left.
Isn’t it interesting what the media considers newsworthy? Wonder why the media isn’t interested in that? Guess it doesn’t fit the image they try to create for conservatives.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/romney-bain-wsj-article/	"""What I Learned at Bain Capital""  by Mitt Romney"	Official!				2015/03/17	" 
What I Learned at Bain Capital Mitt Romney  Wall Street Journal August 23, 2012  http://online.wsj.com 
The back-to-school season is here, and as parents take their children to shop for school supplies, I suspect that many of them will be visiting a Staples store. I’m very familiar with those stores because Staples is one of many businesses we helped create and expand at Bain Capital, a firm that my colleagues and I built. The firm succeeded by growing and fixing companies. 
The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington. 
A broad message emerges from my Bain Capital days: A good idea is not enough for a business to succeed. It requires a talented team, a good business plan and capital to execute it. That was true of companies we helped start, like Staples and the Bright Horizons child-care provider, and several of the struggling companies we helped turn around, like the Brookstone retailer and the contact-lens maker Wesley Jessen. 
My presidency would make it easier for entrepreneurs and small businesses to get the investment dollars they need to grow, by reducing and simplifying taxes; replacing Obamacare with real health-care reform that contains costs and improves care; and by stemming the flood of new regulations that are tying small businesses in knots. 
My business experience confirmed my belief in empowering people. For example, at Bain Capital we bought Accuride, a company that made truck rims and wheels, because we saw untapped potential there. We instituted performance bonuses for the management team, which had a dramatic impact. The managers made the plants more productive, and the company started growing, adding 300 jobs while Bain was involved. My faith in people, not government, is at the foundation of my plan to strengthen America’s middle class. 
I also saw firsthand through these investments how energy costs impact the ability of a business to grow. Today, energy costs are weighing on job creators across America because President Obama has limited energy exploration and restricted development in ways that sap economic performance, curtail growth, and kill jobs. I will take a sensible approach to tapping our energy resources, which will both create jobs and make energy more affordable for every sector of our economy. 
In the 1990s, when the “old-technology” steel industry in the U.S. was failing, Bain Capital helped build a new steel company, Steel Dynamics, which has grown into one of the largest steel producers in America today, holding its own against Chinese producers. The key to its success? State-of-the-art new technology. 
Here are two lessons from the Steel Dynamics story: First, innovation is essential to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. We are the most innovative, entrepreneurial nation in the world. To maintain that lead, we must give people the skills to succeed. My plan for a stronger middle class includes policies to give every family access to great schools and quality teachers, to improve access to higher education, and to attract and retain the best talent from around the world. 
The second lesson is that we must have a level playing field in international trade. As president, I will challenge unfair trade practices that are harming American workers. 
Running a business also brings lessons in tackling challenges. I was on the board of a medical diagnostic-laboratory company, Damon, when a competitor announced that it had settled with the government over a charge of fraudulent Medicare billing. I and fellow Damon outside board members joined together and immediately hired an independent law firm to examine Damon’s own practices. 
The investigation revealed a need to make some changes, which we did. The company, along with several other clinical-laboratory companies, ended up being fined for billing practices. And a Damon manager who was responsible for the fraud went to jail. The experience taught me that when you see a problem, run toward it or it will only get worse. 
That will be my approach to our federal budget problem. I am committed to capping federal spending below 20% of GDP and reducing nondefense discretionary spending by 5%. This will surely result in much wailing and gnashing of teeth in Washington. But a failure of leadership has created our debt crisis, and ducking responsibility will only cripple the economy and smother opportunity for our children and grandchildren. 
I’m not sure Bain Capital could have grown or turned around some of the companies we invested in had we faced today’s anti-business environment. Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants Inc., which employs about 21,000 people at Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurants, has said that the “current unfriendly economic environment perhaps best explains why American companies are sitting on over $2 trillion which they could invest.” 
President Obama has piled on excessive regulations, proposed massive tax increases, added more than $5 trillion in federal debt, and failed to address the coming fiscal cliff-all of which is miring our nation in sluggish growth and high unemployment. 
I know what it takes to turn around difficult situations. And I will put that experience to work, to get our economy back on track, create jobs, strengthen the middle class and lay the groundwork for America’s increased competitiveness in the world.

For too long we have been complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens have no idea that members of Congress can retire with full pay after only one term, that they don’t pay into Social Security and that they have specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment). “Ordinary” citizens must live under all those laws. 
The latest travesty is that Congress will exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform that is being considered…in all of its forms. Somehow, that doesn’t seem quite right. We do not have an elite class that is above the law. I truly don’t care if they are Democrats, Republicans, Independents or whatever.  The self-serving must stop. 
This is a good way to do that. It is an idea whose time has come.  Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:
“Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States “.
Each person contact a minimum of twenty people on their email address list, in turn ask each of those to do likewise.
In approximately three days, all people in the United States of America will have the Message. This is one proposal that really should be passed around.
Other Version:

Subject: 35 STATES SO FAR AND GROWING!
I hope you will all send this to as many people as you can. Thanks. 
35 States So Far & Growing 
SOUNDS LIKE WE’RE ON THE RIGHT PATH—FINALLY! 
Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon them. It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention.
This will take less than thirty seconds to read. If you agree, please pass it on.
This is an idea that we should address.

Rabbi Pruzansky On Why Obama Won and How We Are Lost 
November 2012
 I dare Liberals / Democrats to read this through carefully. You will not like the Rabbi’s words. Saying that, his words will not make conservatives feel any better either. In his opinion America is dead, but none of its citizens realize that yet.
By Rabbi Steven Pruzansky, spiritual leader of Congregation Bnai Yeshurun, Teaneck, New Jersey
 The most charitable way of explaining the election results of 2012 is that Americans voted for the status quo – for the incumbent President and for a divided Congress. They must enjoy gridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility. And fewer people voted. As I write, with almost all the votes counted, President Obama has won fewer votes than John McCain won in 2008, and more than ten million off his own 2008 total.
 But as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the Romney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because of the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a poor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better candidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy due to the business cycle.
 Romney lost because he didn’t get enough votes to win.
 That might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the conservative virtues – the traditional American virtues – of liberty, hard work, free enterprise, private initiative and aspirations to moral greatness – no longer inspire or animate a majority of the electorate. The notion of the “Reagan Democrat” is one cliché that should be permanently retired.
 Ronald Reagan himself could not win an election in today’s America.
 The simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free stuff. Every businessman knows this; that is why the “loss leader” or the giveaway is such a powerful marketing tool. Obama’s America is one in which free stuff is given away: the adults among the 47,000,000 on food stamps clearly recognized for whom they should vote, and so they did, by the tens of millions; those who – courtesy of Obama – receive two full years of unemployment benefits (which, of course, both disincentivizes looking for work and also motivates people to work off the books while collecting their windfall) surely know for whom to vote; so too those who anticipate “free” health care, who expect the government to pay their mortgages, who look for the government to give them jobs. The lure of free stuff is irresistible.
 Imagine two restaurants side by side. One sells its customers fine cuisine at a reasonable price, and the other offers a free buffet, all-you-can-eat as long as supplies last. Few – including me – could resist the attraction of the free food. Now imagine that the second restaurant stays in business because the first restaurant is forced to provide it with the food for the free buffet, and we have the current economy, until, at least, the first restaurant decides to go out of business. (Then, the government takes over the provision of free food to its patrons.) The defining moment of the whole campaign was the revelation (by the amoral Obama team) of the secretly-recorded video in which Romney acknowledged the difficulty of winning an election in which “47% of the people” start off against him because they pay no taxes and just receive money – “free stuff” – from the government. Almost half of the population has no skin in the game – they don’t care about high taxes, promoting business, or creating jobs, nor do they care that the money for their free stuff is being borrowed from their children and from the Chinese. They just want the free stuff that comes their way at someone else’s expense. In the end, that 47% leaves very little margin for error for any Republican, and does not bode well for the future.
 It is impossible to imagine a conservative candidate winning against such overwhelming odds. People do vote their pocketbooks. In essence, the people vote for a Congress who will not raise their taxes, and for a President who will give them free stuff, never mind who has to pay for it.
 That engenders the second reason why Romney lost: the inescapable conclusion that the electorate is dumb – ignorant, and uninformed. Indeed, it does not pay to be an informed voter, because most other voters – the clear majority – are unintelligent and easily swayed by emotion and raw populism. That is the indelicate way of saying that too many people vote with their hearts and not their heads. That is why Obama did not have to produce a second term agenda, or even defend his first-term record. He needed only to portray Mitt Romney as a rapacious capitalist who throws elderly women over a cliff, when he is not just snatching away their cancer medication, while starving the poor and cutting taxes for the rich. Obama could get away with saying that “Romney wants the rich to play by a different set of rules” – without ever defining what those different rules were; with saying that the “rich should pay their fair share” – without ever defining what a “fair share” is; with saying that Romney wants the poor, elderly and sick to “fend for themselves” – without even acknowledging that all these government programs are going bankrupt, their current insolvency only papered over by deficit spending. Obama could get away with it because he knew he was talking to dunces waving signs and squealing at any sight of him. 
 During his 1956 presidential campaign, a woman called out to Adlai Stevenson: “Senator, you have the vote of every thinking person!” Stevenson called back: “That’s not enough, madam, we need a majority!” Truer words were never spoken.
 Similarly, Obama (or his surrogates) could hint to blacks that a Romney victory would lead them back into chains and proclaim to women that their abortions and birth control would be taken away. He could appeal to Hispanics that Romney would have them all arrested and shipped to Mexico (even if they came from Cuba or Honduras), and unabashedly state that he will not enforce the current immigration laws. He could espouse the furtherance of the incestuous relationship between governments and unions – in which politicians ply the unions with public money, in exchange for which the unions provide the politicians with votes, in exchange for which the politicians provide more money and the unions provide more votes, etc., even though the money is gone. He could do and say all these things because he knew his voters were dolts.
 One might reasonably object that not every Obama supporter could be unintelligent. But they must then rationally explain how the Obama agenda can be paid for, aside from racking up multi-trillion dollar deficits. “Taxing the rich” does not yield even 10% of what is required – so what is the answer, i.e., an intelligent answer?  Obama also knows that the electorate has changed – that whites will soon be a minority in America (they’re already a minority in California) and that the new immigrants to the US are primarily from the Third World and do not share the traditional American values that attracted immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is a different world, and a different America. Obama is part of that different America, knows it, and knows how to tap into i
t. That is why he won. 
 Obama also proved again that negative advertising works, invective sells, and harsh personal attacks succeed. That Romney never engaged in such diatribes points to his essential goodness as a person; his “negative ads” were simple facts, never personal abuse – facts about high unemployment, lower take-home pay, a loss of American power and prestige abroad, a lack of leadership, etc. As a politician, though, Romney failed because he did not embrace the devil’s bargain of making unsustainable promises, and by talking as the adult and not the adolescent. Obama has spent the last six years campaigning; even his governance has been focused on payoffs to his favored interest groups. The permanent campaign also won again, to the detriment of American life.
 It turned out that it was not possible for Romney and Ryan – people of substance, depth and ideas – to compete with the shallow populism and platitudes of their opponents. Obama mastered the politics of envy – of class warfare – never reaching out to Americans as such but to individual groups, and cobbling together a winning majority from these minority groups. Conservative ideas failed to take root and states that seemed winnable, and amenable to traditional American values, have simply disappeared from the map. If an Obama could not be defeated – with his record and his vision of America, in which free stuff seduces voters – it is hard to envision any change in the future. The road to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to a European-socialist economy – those very economies that are collapsing today in Europe – is paved.
 A second cliché that should be retired is that America is a center-right country. It clearly is not. It is a divided country with peculiar voting patterns, and an appetite for free stuff. Studies will invariably show that Republicans in Congress received more total votes than Democrats in Congress, but that means little. The House of Representatives is not truly representative of the country. That people would vote for a Republican Congressmen or Senator and then Obama for President would tend to reinforce point two above: the empty-headedness of the electorate. Americans revile Congress but love their individual Congressmen. Go figure.
 The mass media’s complicity in Obama’s re-election cannot be denied. One example suffices. In 2004, CBS News forged a letter in order to imply that President Bush did not fulfill his Air National Guard service during the Vietnam War, all to impugn Bush and impair his re-election prospects. In 2012, President Obama insisted – famously – during the second debate that he had stated all along that the Arab attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi was “terror” (a lie that Romney fumbled and failed to exploit). Yet, CBS News sat on a tape of an interview with Obama in which Obama specifically avoided and rejected the claim of terrorism – on the day after the attack – clinging to the canard about the video. (This snippet of a “60 Minutes” interview was not revealed – until two days ago!) In effect, CBS News fabricated evidence in order to harm a Republican president, and suppressed evidence in order to help a Democratic president. Simply shameful, as was the media’s disregard of any scandal or story that could have jeopardized the Obama re-election.
 One of the more irritating aspects of this campaign was its limited focus, odd in light of the billions of dollars spent. Only a few states were contested, a strategy that Romney adopted, and that clearly failed. The Democrat begins any race with a substantial advantage. The liberal states – like the bankrupt California and Illinois – and other states with large concentrations of minority voters as well as an extensive welfare apparatus, like New York, New Jersey and others – give any Democratic candidate an almost insurmountable edge in electoral votes. In New Jersey, for example, it literally does not pay for a conservative to vote. It is not worth the fuel expended driving to the polls. As some economists have pointed out generally, and it resonates here even more, the odds are greater that a voter will be killed in a traffic accident on his way to the polls than that his vote will make a difference in the election. It is an irrational act. That most states are uncompetitive means that people are not amenable to new ideas, or new thinking, or even having an open mind. If that does not change, and it is hard to see how it can change, then the die is cast. America is not what it was, and will never be again.
 For Jews, mostly assimilated anyway and staunch Democrats, the results demonstrate again that liberalism is their Torah. Almost 70% voted for a president widely perceived by Israelis and most committed Jews as hostile to Israel. They voted to secure Obama’s future at America’s expense and at Israel’s expense – in effect, preferring Obama to Netanyahu by a wide margin. A dangerous time is ahead. Under present circumstances, it is inconceivable that the US will take any aggressive action against Iran and will more likely thwart any Israeli initiative. That Obama’s top aide Valerie Jarrett (i.e., Iranian-born Valerie Jarrett) spent last week in Teheran is not a good sign. The US will preach the importance of negotiations up until the production of the first Iranian nuclear weapon – and then state that the world must learn to live with this new reality. As Obama has committed himself to abolishing America’s nuclear arsenal, it is more likely that that unfortunate circumstance will occur than that he will succeed in obstructing Iran’s plans.
 Obama’s victory could weaken Netanyahu’s re-election prospects, because Israelis live with an unreasonable – and somewhat pathetic – fear of American opinion and realize that Obama despises Netanyahu. A Likud defeat – or a diminution of its margin of victory – is more probable now than yesterday. That would not be the worst thing. Netanyahu, in fact, has never distinguished himself by having a strong political or moral backbone, and would be the first to cave to the American pressure to surrender more territory to the enemy and acquiesce to a second (or third, if you count Jordan) Palestinian state. A new US Secretary of State named John Kerry, for example (he of the Jewish father) would not augur well. Netanyahu remains the best of markedly poor alternatives. Thus, the likeliest outcome of the upcoming Israeli elections is a center-left government that will force itself to make more concessions and weaken Israel – an Oslo III.
 But this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there is an enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile. The most powerful empires in history all crumbled – from the Greeks and the Romans to the British and the Soviets. None of the collapses were easily foreseen, and yet they were predictable in retrospect.
 The American empire began to decline in 2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only hastens that decline. Society is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings and its moral foundations. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in years to come. Across the world, America under Bush was feared but not respected. Under Obama, America is neither feared nor respected. Radical Islam has had a banner four years under Obama, and its prospects for future growth look excellent. The “Occupy” riots across this country in the last two years were mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead – years of unrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the unsuccessful who want to seize the
fruits and the bounty of the successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of redistribution. Two bright sides: Notwithstanding the election results, I arose this morning, went to shul, davened and learned Torah afterwards. That is our reality, and that trumps all other events. Our relationship with God matters more than our relationship with any politician, R or D. And, notwithstanding the problems in Israel, it is time for Jews to go home, to Israel. We have about a decade, perhaps 15 years, to leave with dignity and without stress. Thinking that it will always be because it always was has been a repetitive and deadly Jewish mistake. America was always the land from which “positive” aliya came – Jews leaving on their own, and not fleeing a dire situation. But that can also change. The increased aliya in the last few years is partly attributable to young people fleeing the high cost of Jewish living in America. Those costs will only increase in the coming years. We should draw the appropriate conclusions.
 If this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone. And, sad for the world, it is not coming back.
 If you have integrity, nothing else matters. If you don’t have integrity, nothing else matters. — Benjamin Franklin

 President Bush should “Stand Up” to First Lady’s Stand-up Routine
Sunday, May 1, 2005 By Pastor Roy DeLong Chairman, Coalition for Traditional Values
 Members of the elite media and their allies inside the beltway were greatly amused by the performance of the First Lady at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this weekend.  We at the Coalition for Traditional Values were appalled.
 Proverbs puts it best: “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, but she that maketh him ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.”  We would imagine that President Bush is feeling pretty rotten right now.
 As you know, the family plays an essential role in Christianity, and the Bible is crystal clear about the structure of that family.  “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.  Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.”  (Ephesians 5:22-24)
 That is not what we saw this weekend.  Instead, we saw our President undermined, mocked, and emasculated by his own wife on the most public of stages, and at a time when his manliness is already under attack.  We saw the leader of the free world seemingly unable to lead his own family.  Mr. President, as God’s elected represented here on earth, you owe it to every American to live your life as an example to us.  And that example extends to the behavior of your wife, Mrs. Bush, as well.
 The Coalition for Traditional Values encourages you both to put this sorry episode behind you so that this country, founded on Judeo-Christian principles, can move forward, following the lead of the First Family.  And that family should be prepared to lead by Biblical example:  Him first, the husband second, and the wife in him.

???????????????????????
Cattle Guards
For those of you who have never traveled to the great West or Southwest, cattle guards are horizontal steel rails placed at fence openings, in dug-out places in the roads adjacent to highways (sometimes across highways), to prevent cattle from crossing. For some reason the bovines will not step on the guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the rails. I need to make that clear in order for everyone to appreciate the following TRUE story.
While in office, President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle guards in Colorado. Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado’s Congress-woman Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they be given six months of retraining. (and we PAY these people)

A few months ago, President Obama received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle guards in Colorado . Because Colorado ranchers had protested his proposed changes in grazing policies, he ordered the Secretary of the Interior to fire half of the guards immediately.
Before the Interior Secretary could respond … and presumably straighten him out … Vice-President Joe Biden intervened with a request that before any guards were fired, they be given six months of retraining. After a request from Barney Frank, Nancy Pelosi appointed a commission to study what effect the methane gas emitted by the cattle had on the health of the guards. Senator Chris Dodd’s committee initiated a study to see if the guards have had the opportunity for low-interest housing loans … and will make sure the interest is forgiven for those losing their jobs. Harry Reid had a bill introduced that will make sure the terminated guards have health care for life, for themselves and their families. (Including the children, until they reach age 65).
(The media hasn’t covered this, yet, because they are still covering Joe Biden’s use of the “F-word” when the mikes were open.)

https://www.truthorfiction.com/bush-tilley/	President Bush’s Greeting and Prayer for a Wounded Soldier Who Lost His Right Hand	Mostly Truth!				2015/03/17	"  A story worth sharing…
  An unreported story worth sharing… At a recent  Soldiers Breakfast held at Redstone Arsenal, AL,  Sergeant Major of the Army Jack Tilley shared the  following story. (The vignette was captured by James  Henderson, Association of the U.S. Army Redstone  Huntsville Chapter Chaplain. Please distribute far and  wide…it is worth sharing!!)  He (SMA Jack Tilley) described one such recent visit  to our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Center  in Washington that I (Chaplain Henderson) will never  forget.
  “The Special Forces soldier had lost his right hand  and suffered severe wounds of his face and side of his  body. As SMA Tilley described, how do you honor such a  soldier, showing respect without offending?
  What can you say or do in such a situation that will  encourage and uplift? How do you shake the right hand  of a soldier who just lost his? Finally he told how he  acted as though the man had a hand, taking his wrist  as though it were his hand and speaking encouragement  to him.
  But he said there was another man in that group of  visitors who had even brought his wife with him to  visit the wounded who knew exactly what to do. This  man reverently took this soldier’s stump of a hand in  both of his hands, bowed at the bedside and prayed for  him. When he stood from praying he bent over and  kissed the man on the head and told him he loved him.
  What a powerful _expression of love for one our  wounded heroes! And what a beautiful Christ-like  example! What kind of man would kneel in such humility  and submission to the Living God of the Bible?
  It was George W. Bush, President of the United States  and Commander in Chief of our Armed forces, a man who  understands and follows his chain of command, a leader  God has given us.

If you really believe that President BUSH lied – – THAT THERE NEVER WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ AND HE TOOK US TO WAR SOLELY FOR HIS OIL BUDDIES –then read this and, if you are the fair minded person that I believe you to be–, PASS IT ON TO YOUR ENTIRE E-MAIL LIST.
“One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.” President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998
“If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program.” President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998
“Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.” Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998
“He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.” Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998
“We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction  programs.” Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998
“Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998
“Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.” Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999
“There is no doubt that … Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.” Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001
“We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.” Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002
“We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002
“Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002
“We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002 “The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons…” Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002
“I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force– if necessary– to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.” Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002
“There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years … We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002
“He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do” Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002
“In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.” Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002
“We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002
 “Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation … And now he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real …” Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan.23.2003
SO NOW THE DEMOCRATS SAY PRESIDENT BUSH LIED, THAT THERE NEVER WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND HE TOOK US TO WAR FOR HIS OIL BUDDIES??? Boy! Talk about two tongued philosophy!!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/leiberman-france/	Letter to the people of France about antiSemitism from Senator JoeLieberman	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" TO THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE – IN REMEMBRANCE 
Liberty, equality, fraternity! Does the French nation recall that slogan?
The current French tolerance of and indifference to the wave of attacks upon French Jews speaks clearly of the decline of the French national character.
The French have forgotten! Two hundred and some odd years ago the suffering French populace erupted in revolution against tyranny. They cried for and fought for liberty, fraternity, equality for all in every aspect of French society.
The French have forgotten! But I remember! I still have in my mind the heartbreaking image of the Parisian gentleman from whose eyes the tears fell copiously as he watched the Nazi troops marching triumphantly into Paris. The face of that Frenchman still lives in my mind sixty years later. It is the same as the faces of so many French Jews today.
The French have forgotten! But I remember! I remember the ecstasy, the flowers, the kisses with which the French people greeted their American and British liberators from Nazi terror.
The French have forgotten! They have forgotten the dehumanizing result of terror upon themselves. They have forgotten the shame of Vichy France. Those who watch with indifference the attacks upon their neighbors sink into degeneracy themselves.
The French have forgotten brotherhood and love of others than themselves. They have forgotten equal justice. They have forgotten that a nation without strength of morality and character is a nation already in the lower depths of degradation.
So, just as the Swiss were part of the Nazi problem sixty years ago, the French are part of the problem of world terrorism today. As the French casually watch their Jewish citizens attacked let them remember how they, the French, acquiesced in cowardice at the rape of Czechoslovakia by the Nazis in 1938 only to suffer under the Nazi heel so soon after.
My contempt for present day France is accompanied by great regret. We gave the lives of American boys to save them once. They have forgotten. However, we Americans have not forgotten. All Americans with integrity of character must boycott France. I hope large numbers of you will join me in this.
If this e-mail is forwarded by just 1/2 of all recipients it could reach 10,000,000 Americans in a matter of days. Let’s make the French remember!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/kerry-pa/	John Kerry forcibly took over a Pennsylvania neighborhood for a campaignappearance	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Hey everyone…… Received this from a very good friend in PA. she wants everyone to know what she saw. 
Good Tuesday morning! John Kerry brought his “front porch meeting” to our Canonsburg, PA neighborhood on Labor Day morning. Since you will never hear the truth from the TV or print media I thought that you should know from someone who was `almost’ there.
The residents who live on the street where the event took place were not allowed to attend.
Kerry shipped in approximately 90 invitation only VIPs. In addition, there was a hard luck case who was about to lose her job at USAIR and another was an elderly woman who was having health care problems. Neither one was from this neighborhood. The street was closed to all traffic the night before and all residents on the street were REQUIRED to remove their Bush/Cheney signs.
The sympathetic police officers on duty told us that! Kerry used imminent domain to claim the street for his purposes. Residents who have homes within the perimeter (approximately 1 full block) were kept behind a line away from the partisan crowd. The rest of us were not allowed within the 1 block cordon. A neighbor from across the street came to the line where we were being kept and asked us to come onto his property. The police told us that we could stand on this mans FORMERLY private property! This was set up so that Kerry’s views could be heard – but not the neighbors. About 30 peoples (mostly neighbors) shouts echoed down the street “Let the neighbors in.”
We could barely hear Kerry speaking with his microphone because press buses were used to block us off from view! This mornings papers are reporting hecklers tried to interrupt Kerry as he spoke to the neighborhood gathering, but he turned our chants to his favor by calling us rude. Even though most of the media! was there to record our stories of not being included in the neighborhood forum, not one of them printed or aired the truth. This is what America will look like if Kerry becomes president.
Get registered and get all of your friends registered to vote if they have not already. Kerry thinks that he is better than the rest of us and he has the media on his side to make him out to be what he is not! Finally, last night as I drove down the street where the rally was, I was shocked to see Bush/Cheney signs in almost every yard on the street! Please send this e-mail on to as many people as you can.
LET FREEDOM RING!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/kerryviet/	John Kerry endorsed by the Communists	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"THINK ABOUT THIS BEFORE VOTING FOR JOHN KERRY and JOHN EDWARDS.
 YOU ALL ARE MY FRIENDS REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU VOTE. I HOPE I DON’T OFFEND ANYONE, BUT THIS SCARES ME TO DEATH…AND I HAD TO SHARE.
 GUESS WHO’S ENDORSING JOHN KERRY????
 The Communist Party of The United States of America, CPUSA, is publicly supporting the election of John Kerry.
 No, this is not a typo…you read it correctly The CPUSA has made available on its website, http://www.cpusa.org/, an advertisement entitled Top Ten Reasons To Defeat Bush. This advertisement can be downloaded. The communist party urges readers to place this ad in local newspapers throughout the country to defeat President Bush.
 Remarkably, the “Top Ten Reasons” of the Communist party are identical to those of the Democratic party; out-sourcing, homosexual rights, abortion and the like.
 At first, it was thought that “t! his was only a coincidence.” The Democratic party of the United States couldn’t be in lock step with the Marxists! So, the originator of this email wrote to a spokesman of the CPUSA in Georgia and here is part of the spokesman’s letter: “The CPUSA supports the John Kerry campaign with donations and volunteer effort. We believe that defeating George Bush is the single most important issue this November”
 **Next, it was discovered that one of Kerry’s campaign themes is “Let America be America Again.” This slogan was borrowed from a Communist poet, Langston Hughes. This is not common knowledge to the average American. “Let America be America Again” sounds good but is a rambling, gloomy poem.
 Interestingly, another poem by Langston goes as follows; “Goodbye, Christ Jesus, Lord, God, Jehovah, Beat it on away from here now. Make way for a new guy with no religion at all — A real guy named Marx, communist, Lenin, Peasant, Stalin, Worker, ME — I said, ME!”
 Then, if this was not convincing enough that the Democratic party has lost it, a third discovery!
 **A Vietnam vet group took a trip to Communist Hanoi to investigate a report that John Kerry was in the “Hanoi Hall of Fame.” Yes, there is a museum in Hanoi with a section dedicated to foreign activists who help defeat the United States Military in Vietnam. Of course, you would expect Jane Fonda’s picture to be there. But, alas, there is John Kerry’s picture shaking the hand of a communist official.
 Never has there been such a tragedy! Never has there been such a threat to America! Has ! the Democratic party has been taken over by the far, far left?
 It’s not only the communists but the homosexual activists who are appalled that George Bush is married to a woman! They are enraged that the President wants a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage between a man and woman.
 Then we have the ACLU running to a federal activist judge with every piece of legislation that doesn’t fit into their leftist agenda. They support every Democratic socialist whim. The removal of the Ten Commandments is their top priority!
 Don’t trust this message for the truth — visit the CPUSA website at http://www.cpusa.org/ — read the articles, and then decide for yourself.
 So..who will you vote for during the next Presidential Election?
 This message needs to be seen by your friends…send it to them

https://www.truthorfiction.com/infidels/	Rick Mathes provided an account of his verbal disagreement with a Muslim Imam during a prison training session.	Mixed	"['evangelicals', 'imam', 'muslims', ""qu'ran"", 'viral facebook posts']"			2015/03/17	" 
Allah or Jesus? by Rick Mathes
Last month I attended my annual training session that’s required for maintaining my state prison security clearance. During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers representing the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths, who explained each of their belief systems.
I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a video.
After the presentations, time was provided for questions and answers.
When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked: “Please, correct me if I’m wrong, but I understand that most Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world. And, that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that’s the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?”
There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he replied, “Non-believers!”
I responded, “So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to Heaven. Is that correct?”
The _expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, “Yes.”
I then stated, “Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to Heaven!”
The Imam was speechless.
I continued, “I also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question. Would you rather have your Allah who tells you to kill me in order to go to Heaven or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to Heaven and He wants you to be with me?”
You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.
Needless to say, the organizers and/or promoters of the ‘Diversification’ training seminar were not happy with Rick’s way of dealing with the Islamic Imam and exposing the truth about the Muslim’s beliefs.
I think everyone in the US should be required to read this, but with the liberal justice system, liberal media, and the ACLU, there is no way this will be widely publicized. Please pass this on to all your email contacts.
This is a true story and the author, Rick Mathes, is a well known leader in prison ministry.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-soldier/	A photograph shows a soldier crossing his fingers as he shakes hands with Sen. Hillary Clinton during a visit to Iraq in 2003, indicating that he was coerced or forced into the action.	Decontextualized	['duress codes', 'hillary clinton', 'iraq']			2015/03/17	" 
Hillary Clinton (D-NY) has already started her 2008 presidential campaign by aligning herself with the military and pretending to be tough on terror.  Fortunately, the ultra-liberal Hillary has yet to brainwash all of the voting public into believers that her symbolism is really substance.  Guess some folks will never forget that she was co-president for eight years in an administration that I QUOTE: “Loath the military”!
Absolutely the best picture EVER!   (read the message below the photo)

 The picture shows that this soldier has been thru Survival School and learned his lessons well. He’s giving the sign of “coercion” with his left hand. These hand signs are taught in survival school to be used by POW’s as a method of posing messages back to our intelligence services who may view the photo or video. This guy was obviously being coerced into shaking hands with Hillary Clinton. It’s ironic how little she knew that he would so inform us about the photo—perhaps because she’s never understood our military to begin with.

John Glenn on the senate floor
Date: Mon, 26 Jan 2004 11:13
Some people still don’t understand why military personnel do what they do for a living. This exchange between Senators John Glenn and Senator Howard Metzenbaum is worth reading. Not only is it a pretty impressive impromptu speech, but it’s also a good example of one man’s explanation of why men and women in the armed services do what they do for a living.
This is a typical, though sad, example of what some who have never served think of the military.
Senator Metzenbaum to Senator Glenn: “How can you run for Senate when you’ve never held a real job?”
Senator Glenn: “I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps.
I served through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire on 12 different occasions. I was in the space program.
It wasn’t my checkbook, Howard; it was my life on the  line. It was not a nine-to-five job, where I took time off to take the daily cash receipts to the bank. I ask you to go with me … as I went the other day… to a veteran’s hospital and look those men – with their mangled bodies – in the eye, and tell them they didn’t hold a job! You go with me to the Space Program at NASA and go, as I have gone, to the widows and Orphans of Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee… and you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their DADS didn’t hold a job.
You go with me on Memorial Day and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery, where I have more friends buried than I’d like to remember, and you watch those waving flags.
You stand there, and you think about this nation, and you tell me that those people didn’t have a job? I’ll tell you, Howard Metzenbaum; you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men – some men – who held real jobs. And they required a dedication to a purpose – and a love of country and a dedication to duty – that was more important than life itself. And their self-sacrifice is what made this country possible.
I have held a job, Howard! What about you?”
For those who don’t remember – During W.W.II, Howard Metzenbaum was an attorney representing the Communist Party in the USA.
He was a Senator!
If you can read this, thank a teacher. If you are reading it in English thank a Veteran.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-afghanistan/	Hillary Clinton inconvenienced U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan	Unproven!				2015/03/17	" 
Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2003 12:44 a.m. EST Bagram GI: Troops Waited While Hillary Chowed Down
U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton forced U.S. troops stationed at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan to wait for their Thanksgiving dinner last Thursday while she and her entourage arrived late, then cut in line and were served first.
A soldier who witnessed the scene tells NewsMax:
“Thanksgiving Dinner started at 3 p.m. that day, so the line was forming around 2:30 p.m. She didn’t show up until around 3:30 p.m.
“Once she got there,” our source maintains, “Clinton and her entourage bumped everyone in line, forcing them to wait almost an extra hour.”
The brass at Bagram apparently had a hard time rounding up New Yorkers who wanted to have dinner with Clinton, D-N.Y. Only six GIs responded to an e-mail sent out last week that stated, “Looking for military members from New York and Rhode Island interested in meeting their Senator/Congressman.”
People magazine was on hand to cover the event and wanted to interview the troops for reaction to Clinton’s visit.
“But they were getting declined left and right,” our source said. “People were actually telling the reporters, ‘You don’t want to print what I think about her and her visit.'”
After Clinton and her entourage departed, the only topics GIs wanted to talk about were “how great the food was and how fantastic they thought George Bush’s visit to Iraq was.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/endorsements/	John Kerry’s Hometown Newspaper Endorses George Bush For President	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Look who has endorsed George Bush…John Kerry’s hometown newspaper, the Lowell Sun! 
It’s about national security. That’s the key issue on the minds of Americans planning to vote in the Nov. 2 presidential election.
They must decide whether Republican President George W. Bush or Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, can provide the leadership to safeguard America from foreign terrorism.
Americans aren’t fools. They know that without safe cities and towns, America will lose its greatness. Our cherished freedoms and sacred liberties will be diminished, along with our opportunities for economic prosperity and our basic pursuit of happiness.
Our children and their children will live vastly different lives if we fail to guarantee a future free of turmoil.
Islamic extremists, both here and abroad, have one purpose: To destroy America and halt the spread of democracy and religious tolerance around the globe.
They’d like to be plotting in our streets right now. They’d like to be sowing murder and mayhem with suicide bombers and hostage-takings, and spreading fear in the heartland and everywhere else. They’d like to be wearing us down and bringing our nation to its knees.
Since the devastating terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, one American leader has maintained an unbending resolve to protect our homeland and interest against Islamic savages and those foreign governments appeasing them.
That leader is President Bush.
While out-of-touch U.S. politicians and world leaders have attacked President Bush’s tactics, they can’t question his steely commitment to keep America safe.
In the ashes of ground zero, where nearly 3,000 innocent Americans perished, President Bush vowed to find the perpetrators, in domestic cells and distant lands, and bring them to justice. He said he will do all that is humanly possible and necessary to make certain that terrorists never strike again on U.S. soil.
Can anyone deny that President Bush has not delivered? America the terrorists’ No. 1 target has recovered from its tragic wounds and rebounded. It remains safe to this day.
What might a lesser leader have done, faced with the daunting task of deciding America’s course against withering, partisan attacks from Democrats, media propagandists, disingenuous U.N. officials and disloyal White House operatives selling their souls for profit during a time of war?
A lesser leader might have caved in. President Bush has stood his ground.
In this year’s election, the question isn’t whether we are safer now than we were four years ago. We already know the answer. Sure we are and that’s because of President Bush. The critical question is: Four years from now, will America be safer than it is today?
In our book, Americans have to place their trust in President Bush. He’s proven to be as sturdy as a mighty oak when it comes to saying what he means, meaning what he says and acting decisively.
When it comes to the war on terror, President Bush means to keep our military strong and our country secure.
John Kerry, on the other hand, has all the attributes of the shape of water when it comes to telling us what he believes and what he’d do for America. Like incoming and outgoing tides, Kerry is content to go with the flow. In a dangerous world infested with sharks, Kerry would be chum at America’s expense.
We in Massachusetts know John Kerry. He got his first taste of politics 32 years ago in the cities and towns of Greater Lowell.
In his 20 years in the U.S. Senate, Kerry, a Navy war hero, hasn’t risen above the rank of seaman for his uninspiring legislative record. He’s been inconsistent on major issues. First he’s for the 1991 Persian Gulf War, then he opposes it. First he’s for the war in Iraq, then he’s against it. First he’s for a strong U.S. defense, then he votes against military weapons programs. First he’s for the U.S. Patriot Act, then he opposes it.
Kerry’s solution to stop terrorism? He’d go to the U.N. and build a consensus. How naive. France’s Jacques Chirac, Germany’s Gerhard Schroeder, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and other Iraq oil-for-food scam artists don’t want America to succeed. They want us brought down to their level. And more and more, Kerry sounds just like them. In a recent campaign speech, Kerry said America was in the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
No doubt John Kerry sincerely wants to serve his country, but we believe he’s the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Americans should think back three years ago to the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center. There among the mist lay the images and memories of fallen firefighters, police, a Catholic chaplain and ordinary working citizens moms, dads, sons, daughters.
President Bush, through heartfelt tears, told us never to forget the twisted carnage and the massacre of the innocents. Yet some of us are forgetting.
President Bush told us the attacks must never happen again. Yet some of us are wavering because of the brave sacrifice of soldiers that our nation’s security demands.
Well, President Bush hasn’t forgotten. Nor has he lost the courage and conviction to do what is right for America.
We know if there is one thing the enemy fears above all else, it is that George Bush’s iron will is stronger than his iron won’t.
The Sun proudly endorses the re-election of President George W. Bush.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/stjohns/	Meeting President Bush at church	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
This is for real. I called Laura Lefler in Sen.. Alexander’s office
 today, 2/23, and she confirmed that she wrote it and is now overwhelmed
 with it spreading via the internet. She sent it so several friends and
 they then put it on its journey. Larry Hone
  
 
  
 Subject: Bush in church, Very interesting
  
 
 
 
  
 I’m at the 8:00am service at my church, St. John’s Episcopal, at
 Lafayette Square, across from the White House. (I wanted to go early
 because I was going with Alice and Brent for breakfast at the Cracker
 Barrel in Manassas.) Much of the service was uneventful–nice, but
 uneventful–until it comes to the part of the service when the priest
 says, “Greet one another in the name of the Lord.” I turn to my right to
 exchange the peace with my friend, Amy Fox Smythe, who was was on the
 other end of my pew. I then shake hands with the person in front of me,
 and turn around to say hello to the person behind me. The person behind me
 was our 43rd President George W. Bush. I am not kidding. A small crowd was
 forming around him, and not wanting to delay the church service or bother
 him by waiting to shake his hand, I turned back around and sat down and
 talked to Amy. About 30 seconds later I felt a hand on my left shoulder
 and turn around to see President Bush with his hand extended. “Peace of
 the Lord, ” he said and held my hand with both of his. “Peace of the
 Lord,” I replied, and held both his hands and smiled at him. I turned back
 around and was remarkably calm about the fact that the most powerful
 person in the world was sitting two feet behind me. I could hear him
 flipping through his bulletin as the priest made the announcements. I
 loved the idea of him thinking, “Oh, there’s a covered dish next Sunday.”
 We perched and when I stood up to go to the communion rail, he got up and
 walked down the aisle behind me. We passed a little old lady who said,
 “Mr. President, I pray for you every day.” To which he said, “That’s a
 very special gift. Thank you so much.” We got to the communion rail and
 there were two spaces, one in front of us and one around the side of the
 altar. We both surmised for ten seconds and then I started off around the
 corner. He stopped me and whispered, “No, no. I’ll go around” and motioned
 for me to take the closer spot. The only exception made in the entire
 service was that the President was allowed to leave first and then the
 rest of the congregation followed.
  
 
  
 With all sincerity, and partisanship aside I tell you: This is a special
 man! There is a peace and a Godliness about him. It radiates from him. It
 is the only reason that I was able to remain calm. It was more than the
 adrenaline I’ve felt when I’ve met other famous people. A goodness flows
 through this man. He has more than my vote in November. He has my respect,
 my prayers, and my gratitude. Whatever your political affiliation, and
 whether or not you agree with his decisions, you should take comfort in

https://www.truthorfiction.com/surprisevisit/	Encounter with the president in Iraq	Truth!				2015/03/17	" From A Capt in Iraq:
 We knew there was a dinner planned with Ambassador Bremer and LTG Sanchez. There were 600 seats available and all the units in the division were tasked with filling a few tables. Naturally, the 501st MI battalion got our table. Soldiers were grumbling about having to sit through another dog-and-pony show, so we had to pick soldiers to attend. I chose not to go. But, about 1500 the G2, LTC Devan, came up to me and with a smile, asked me to come to dinner with him, to meet him in his office at 1600 and bring a camera. I didn’t really care about getting a picture with Sanchez or Bremer, but when the division’s senior intelligence officer asks you to go, you go. 
We were seated in the chow hall, fully decorated for Thanksgiving when aaaaallllll kinds of secret service guys showed up. That was my first clue, because Bremer’s been here before and his personal security detachment is not that big. Then BG Dempsey got up to speak, and he welcomed ambassador Bremer and LTG Sanchez. Bremer thanked us all and pulled out a piece of paper as if to give a speech. He mentioned that the President had given him this thanksgiving speech to give to the troops. He then paused and said that the senior man present should be the one to give it. He then looked at Sanchez, who just smiled. Bremer then said that we should probably get someone more senior to read the speech.
Then, from behind the camouflage netting, the President of the United States came around. The mess hall actually erupted withhollering. Troops bounded to their feet with shocked smiles and just began cheering with all their hearts. The building actually shook. It was just unreal. I was absolutely stunned. Not only for the obvious, but also because I was only two tables away from the podium. There he stood, less than thirty feet away from me! The cheering went on and on and on. Soldiers were hollering, cheering,and a lot of them were crying. There was not a dry eye at my table.
When he stepped up to the cheering, I could clearly see tears running down his cheeks. It was the most surreal moment I’ve had in years. Not since my wedding and son being born. Here was this man, our President, came all the way around the world, spending 17 hours on an airplane and landing in the most dangerous airport in the world, where a plane was shot out of the sky not six days before. Just to spend two hours with his troops. Only to get on a plane and spend another 17 hours flying back. It was a great moment, and I will never forget it.He delivered his speech, which we all loved, when he looked right at me and held his eyes on me.
Then he stepped down and was just mobbed by the soldiers. He slowly worked his way all the way around the chow hall and shook every last hand extended. Every soldier who wanted a photo with the President got one. I made my way through the line, got dinner, then wolfed it down as he was still working the room. You could tell he was really enjoying himself. It wasn’t just a photo opportunity. This man was actually enjoying himself! He worked his way over the course of about 90 minutes towards my side of the room.
Meanwhile, I took the opportunity to shake a few hands. I got a picture with Ambassador Bremer, Talabani (acting Iraqi president) and Achmed Chalabi (another member of the ruling council) and Condaleeza Rice, who was there with him. I felt like I was drunk.
He was getting closer to my table so I went back over to my seat. As he passed and posed for photos, he looked me in theeye and said, “How you doin’, captain.” I smiled and said “God bless you, sir.” To which he responded “I’m proud of what you do, captain.” Then moved on.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/teresakerry/	Presidential Candidate John Kerry’s Wife has Donated Millions of Dollars to a Foundation that Funds “AntiAmerican” efforts	Disputed!				2015/03/17	"
Maria Teresa Thiersten Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry. Married Senator Kerry in 1995. She only took his name eighteen months ago and she is an “interesting” paradox of conflicts.
If you thought John Kerry was scary, he doesn’t hold a candle to his wife! Maria Teresa Thiersten Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry was born in Mozambique, the daughter of a Portuguese physician, was educated in Switzerland and South Africa. Fluent in five languages, she was working as a United Nations interpreter in Geneva in the mid-60’s when she met a “handsome” young American, H. John Heinz, III, who worked at a bank in Geneva. He told her his family was “in the food business.”
They were married in 1966 and returned to Pittsburgh where his family ran the giant H. J. Heinz food company. He was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1971, and in 1976 he was elected to the first of three terms in the United States Senate. A Republican, he wrote a burning diatribe against some of the causes backed by young House member John Kerry.
Several years later, in 1991, he was killed when his plane collided with a Sun Oil Company helicopter over a Philadelphia suburb. The senator, his pilot and copilot, and both of Sun’s helicopter pilots were killed. He was survived by his wife, Teresa, and their three young sons.
Four years later, having inherited Heinz’s $500 million fortune, she married Senator John Forbes Kerry, the liberal then-junior senator from Massachusetts. She became a registered Democrat and the process of her radicalization was set in motion.
Heinz Kerry is not shy about telling people that she required Kerry to sign a prenuptial agreement before they were married. John Kerry may not have check writing privileges on the Heinz catsup and pickle fortune, but he is certainly a willing and uncomplaining beneficiary of it.
A lot of hard-earned money, made through many years of hawking catsup, mustard, and pickles has fallen into the hands of two people who despise successful entrepreneurship and who believe in the confiscatory redistribution of wealth.
So how does Mrs. Heinz Kerry spend John Heinz’s money?
Just one example:
According to the G2 Bulletin, an online intelligence newsletter of WorldNetDaily, in the years between 1995-2001 she gave more than $4 million to an organization called the Tides Foundation. And what does the Tides Foundation do with John Heinz’s money?
They support numerous antiwar groups, including Ramsey Clark’s International Action Center. Clark has offered to defend Saddam Hussein when he’s tried.
They support the Democratic Justice Fund, a joint venture of the Tides Foundation and billionaire hate-monger George Soros. The Democratic Justice Fund seeks to ease restrictions on Muslim immigration from “terrorist” states.
They support the Council for American-Islamic Relations, whose leaders are known to have close ties to the terrorist group, Hamas.
They support the National Lawyers Guild, organized as a communist front during the Cold War era. One of their attorneys, Lynne Stewart, has been arrested for helping a client, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, communicate with terror cells in Egypt. He is the convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
They support the “Barrio Warriors,” a radical Hispanic group whose primary goal is to return all of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas to Mexico.
These are but a few of the radical groups that benefit, through the anonymity provided by the Tides Foundation, from the generosity of our would-be first lady, the wealthy widow of Republican senator John Heinz, and now the wife of the Democratic senator who aspires to be the 44th President of the United States.
Aiding and supporting our enemies is not good for America, regardless of your political views.

_________________________________________
Interesting ..
SECRET SERVICE OPINIONS WHAT WAS, COULD HAVE
BEEN, AND WHAT IS
What was:
Hillary Clinton was arrogant and orally abusive to
her security detail. She forbade her daughter, Chelsea, from exchanging pleasantries with them.
Sometimes Chelsea, miffed at her mothers obvious
conceit and mean spiritedness ignored her demands and exchanged pleasantries regardless, but
never in her mother presence. Chelsea really was a nice, kind hearted, and
lovely young lady. The consensus opinion was that
Chelsea loved her mom but did not like her.
Hillary Clinton was constituently rude and abrasive
to those who were charged to protect her life. Her security detail dutifully did their job, as professionals should, but they all “loathed ” her and wanted to be on a
different detail. She was hard work because she was
so nasty and mean toward her detail. Hillary Clinton was uniformly despised by the secret service as a whole.
Former president Bill Clinton was much more amiable
than his wife Hillary.
Often the secret service would cringe at the verbal
attack antics that Hillary would use against her husband, the then president. They were embarrassed for his sake by the manner and frequency in which she verbally insulted him, sometimes in the presence of the
secret service, and sometimes behind closed doors. Even behind closed door Hillary Clinton would scream
and holler so loudly that everyone could hear what
she was saying. Many felt sorry for President Clinton and most wondered why he tolerated it instead of just divorcing his “attack dog” wife. It was crystal clear that
the Clinton’s neither liked or respected each other
and this was true long before the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Theirs was genuinely a “marriage of convenience.”
Chelsea was much closer to her father than her
mother, even after the Lewinsky scandal which hurt her gravely. Bill Clinton did in fact have “charisma,” and occasionally would smile at or shake hands with his security detail. Still, he always displayed an obvious air of superiority towards
them. His security detail uniformly believed him to
be disingenuous, false, and that he did nothing without a motive that in
some way would enhance his image and political career. They did respect him, unlike his wife, but they did not particularly like him and nobody trusted him. He was polite, but not kind.
What could have been:
Al Gore was the male version of Hillary Clinton.
They were more friendly toward each other than either of them were towards former President Clinton.
They were not intimate, so please don’t read that in. They were very close in a political way. Tipper Gore was generally nice and pleasant. She initially liked Hillary but soon after the election
she had her pegged and no longer liked her or associated with her except for events that were politically obligatory.
Al Gore was far more left wing and very hateful, not
just politically opposed, to Republicans than Bill Clinton. Al Gore
resented Bill Clinton and thought he was to centrist. He despised all
republicans. His hatred was bitter and this was long before he announced for the presidency. This bitter hatred was something that he and Hillary had very much in common.
They often said as much, even in the presence of
their security detail. Neither of them trusted Bill Clinton and, the secret service opined, neither of them even liked Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton did have some good qualities where Al Gore and Hillary had none in the view of their security details.

AL Gore, like Hillary, was very rude and arrogant
toward his security detail. He was extremely unappreciative and would not hesitate to scold them in the presence of their peers for minor details over which they had no control. Al Gore also looked down on them in disgust as they finally
observed and learned with certainty on one occasion
when Al Gore got angry at his offspring and loudly, in their presence,
pointed at his security detail and said “do you want to grow up and be like them.” Word of this insulting and demeaning verbiage by the former Vice-president quickly spread and he became as despised and disliked by the secret service as Hillary.

Most of them prayed that Al Gore would not be elected president and they
really did have private small celebrations in a few of their homes after
President Bush won. This was not necessarily to celebrate President Bush’s
election, but to celebrate AL Gore’s defeat. He was very disliked. Al Gore
was not a good and kind person. That he could have been our President may
suggest that God was “answering prayers” and looking out for the country
with Al Gore’s defeat.
What is:
Everyone in the secret service wants to be on First Lady Laura Bush’s
detail. Without exception they uniformly concede that she is perhaps the
most nice, kind, and genuinely good person they have ever had the privilege
of serving. Where Hillary patently refused to allow her picture to be taken
with her security detail, Laura Bush doesn’t even have to be asked, she
offers. She doesn’t just shake their hand and say thank you, very often she will give them a kind hearted hug to members of her detail to express her appreciation. There is nothing false about her. This is her genuine nature.

Laura Bush really is this kind of a person and her security detail considers
her to be a “breath of fresh air.” They
actually love her as a human being.
They joke that comparing Laura Bush with Hillary Clinton is like comparing
Mother Teresa with the Wicked Witch of the North.
Likewise, the secret service considers President Bush to be a gem of a man
to work for. He always treats them with genuine respect and he always
trusts and listens to their expert advice. They especially like the Crawford detail. Every time the president goes to Crawford he has a Bar-B-Q for his security detail and “he” helps serve them. He eats with them, sits with them, and talks with them. He always asks about their family, the names of which he always remembers, and he of course knows each of them by their first name and calls them by their first name as a show of affection.
They believe that he actually loves his security detail and that he is
deeply and genuinely appreciative of their service.
They could not like, love, or respect anyone more than President Bush,
and most of them did not know they would feel this way until they had an
opportunity to work for him and learn that his manner was genuine and
consistent. It has never changed in the three years that he has been president. He always treats them with the utmost respect, kindness, and compassion.
Please pass this on to everyone you know. It is important for everyday
Americans to have a true inside understanding of their President and those
who would be president. Finally, The secret service still is forming an opinion on John Kerry. They have nothing positive or negative to say that anyone is willing to share as yet. This notwithstanding, they already know what they have in President Bush and they don’t want to lose a good thing.

Quote by Colin Powell:
When in England at a fairly large conference, Colin Powell was asked by
the Archbishop of Canterbury if our plans for Iraq were just an example of
empire building by George Bush.
He answered by saying that, “Over the years, the United States has sent
many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom
beyond our borders. The only amount of land we have ever asked for in
return is enough to bury those that did not return.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/patterson/	President Clinton watched golf instead of giving a decision on a criticalattack against Iraq	Disputed!				2015/03/17	" Book Bombshell: Iraq Attack Scrubbed for Clinton Golf Game 
Ex-President Bill Clinton kept a squadron of F-117 stealth fighter-bombers and B-52s waiting to launch a critical 1996 airstrike on Iraq while he finished watching a golf tournament – dithering so long that U.S. pilots lost the cover of darkness and the mission had to be scrubbed.
That’s the explosive charge leveled in a brand new book by Lt. Col. Robert Patterson, a key Clinton military aide from 1996 through 1998 whose primary mission was to carry the president’s copy of America’s nuclear launch codes.
“We dispatched eight F-117 stealth fighter-bombers capable of carrying 2,000-pound bombs into the region and sent B-52s to Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, in preparation for action,” reveals Lt. Col. Patterson in his bombshell security scandal tell-all, “Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton Compromised America’s National Security.”
The Sept. 13, 1996, air strike was planned as the U.S.’s response to an Aug. 31 tank attack launched by Saddam Hussein on the northern Kurdish city of Irbil, a blatant violation of the 1991 Gulf War surrender accords that had an estimated 300,000 Kurdish refugees fleeing for their lives.
At the same time, Saddam’s Republican Guard had executed an estimated 100 Iraqi dissidents and arrested 1,500 more – extinguishing whatever opposition the Iraqi dictator might have faced from within.
Two days before he attended the President’s Cup golf tournament, Clinton had warned the world that “action is imminent” and that “the determination of the United States in dealing with the problem of Iraq should not be underestimated,” reports the national security whistle-blower.
With the F-117s and B-52s ready to take off and the cover of darkness in Iraq slipping away, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger placed a series of desperate phone calls to the Manassas, Va., golf course seeking clearance from Clinton. But the president refused to come to the phone.
“Sir, Mr. Berger is on the line and needs a decision about the proposed attack on Iraq,” Lt. Col. Patterson remembers telling the president.
Clinton’s response? “Tell him I’ll get back with him later.”
As mission-critical minutes evaporated, an anxious Berger called again.
“This time he was animated, obviously upset,” remembers Patterson. “Pilots were in the cockpits waiting to launch, targets were identified, everything was in place, all he needed was the go-ahead.”
The presidential military aide promised the national security adviser that he would do everything he could to get Clinton to pay attention to the mission at hand.
“This time, the president was engaged in conversations with several people and was less approachable,” Patterson reports. “I maneuvered through the crowd and caught his eye. When President Clinton saw me, he seemed disturbed at being interrupted again with something unimportant. He frowned as I neared him.”
Still Patterson persisted. “‘Mr. President, Mr. Berger has called again and needs a decision soon.’ I explained in a low tone, ‘We have our pilots in cockpits, ready to launch, and we’re running out of the protective cover of nighttime over there.'”
But Clinton seemed unmoved. “I’ll call Berger when I get the chance,” he told the aide.
Less than 15 minutes later Berger called back. “This time he was irate,” Patterson recalls. “Where is the president? What is he doing? Can I talk to him?”
The presidential military aide was forced to explain: Sir, he is watching the golf tournament with several friends. I’ve approached him twice with your request. I’ve communicated your concerns about the window of opportunity and about the pilots being prepared and ready to go.
“I’m an Air Force pilot myself, sir.” Patterson told Berger. “I understand the ramifications. I’ll try again.”
For the third time in an hour, the military aide desperately tried to get Clinton to focus on the mission – hoping he would appreciate that further delay could jeopardize the lives of U.S. pilots now waiting for his order.
But Clinton remained oblivious. “Tell Berger that I’ll give him a call on my way back to the White House,” he said, in what Patterson describes as an “indifferent” tone of voice. “That’s all,” Clinton added, in words the military man understood to mean the president didn’t want to hear any more about the problem.
“I called Mr. Berger and explained that the president would contact him from the limo,” Patterson recalled. “We both knew what that meant. We’d missed our opportunity.”
The trusted soldier says he remains haunted by the episode. “Human lives were at stake – the lives of American service members and the lives of our allies who opposed Saddam at our behest and were now under attack.
“At a time when America’s honor and grander principles were being challenged and the world was watching our every move … the president was watching golf.”

I was appalled by the comments of Peter Jennings this morining referring to President Bush. His comment that President Bush shoud “quit hiding behind the Secret Service, come out and face the Nation and explain ‘The President’s Failure’ to protect the country from these terrorists attacks.”
As far as I am concerned, this is at best “the lowest form of attack and unworthy of any news organization” and at worst could be considered an act of “Treason.” I want you to know that I am asking all of my firends and acquaintances to join me in a boycott of ABC-all programs as all times-and will not watch your network again as long as Peter Jennings is an ABC employee. While people are removed from the air for using “politically incorrect” words the words of Peter Jennings are orders of magnitude more egregious and offensive than any of these other “offenses.” I request, no I demand that you fire Peter Jennings forwith for his lack of journalistic integrity and his attack on the President during this National Crisis.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/australia-pm-sharia/	Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd Said “No” to Sharia	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"W O W ! She Did It Again!!!  



 Australia says NO — This will be the second Time Julia Gillard has done this! 
She sure isn’t backing down on her hard line stance and one has to appreciate her belief in the rights of her native countrymen. 
A breath of fresh air to see someone lead. Australian Prime Minister does it again!! 
The whole world needs a leader like this! Prime Minister Julia Gillard – Australia 
Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia, as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks. 
Separately, Gillard angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying she supported spy agencies  monitoring the nation’s mosques. Quote:  ‘IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT… Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians.’ 
‘This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.’ 
‘We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, 
Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!’ 
‘Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.’ 
‘We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.’ 
‘This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, ‘THE RIGHT TO LEAVE’.’ 
‘If you aren’t happy here then LEAVE. We didn’t force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.’ 
NOTE: IF we circulate this amongst ourselves in Canada & USA , WE will find the courage to start speaking and voicing the same truths. 
If you agree please SEND THIS ON and ON, to as many people as you know…
 
Older version:
A senior member of Australia’s government has said Muslims who want to live by Islamic Sharia law are not welcome in the country. The comments have stoked Muslim anger against the Australian government. 
Australian Finance Minister Peter Costello said in a speech late Thursday that immigrants must respect the country’s laws and traditions. Costello singled out Muslims who wanted to live under Sharia law as not welcome in Australia. 
In his speech on Australian citizenship, the minister said his remarks were directed at what he called a “small radical minority.” “You don’t have to swear at the football and eat a pie to be an Australian,” he said, “but you do have believe in democracy, the rule of law and the rights and liberties of others.” 
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard also addressed Islamic extremism, saying it violated Australia’s principles. He pointed to contentious issues such as relations with non-Muslims and the rights of women. 
Australian Muslims have reacted with anger to both sets of comments. They accuse the government of being deliberately inflammatory and divisive. 
Keysar Trad, president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, says Costello’s comments are unnecessary. “He is singling out the Muslim community again,” he said. “Rather than calling on all citizens to respect the law of the land and respect traditional values, he is making an inference in his comments that Muslims don’t do that. Well, on the contrary, Muslims do respect the law of the land and do respect the values of this country.” 
There are around 300,000 Muslims in Australia. 
Community leaders say racism toward this minority group has increased since the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001 and the bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali a year later, in which Australian tourists were targeted.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pastor-dave-san-diego-permit/	San Diego County Officials told pastor that he can not hold a Bible studyin his home without a permit	Truth!  but Decision Reversed!				2015/03/17	" 


A San Diego pastor and his wife claim they were interrogated by a county official and warned they will face escalating fines if they continue to hold Bible studies in their home. 
The couple, whose names are being withheld until a demand letter can be filed on their behalf, told their attorney a county government employee knocked on their door on Good Friday, asking a litany of questions about their Tuesday night Bible studies, which are attended by approximately 15 people. 
“Do you have a regular weekly meeting in your home? Do you sing? Do you say ‘amen’?” the official reportedly asked. “Do you say, ‘Praise the Lord’?” 
The pastor’s wife answered yes.  
She says she was then told, however, that she must stop holding “religious assemblies” until she and her husband obtain a Major Use Permit from the county, a permit that often involves traffic and environmental studies, compliance with parking and sidewalk regulations and costs that top tens of thousands of dollars. 
And if they fail to pay for the MUP, the county official reportedly warned, the couple will be charged escalating fines beginning at $100, then $200, $500, $1000, “and then it will get ugly.” 
Remind the world who’s really in charge with the “Worship GOD, not GOV” magnetic bumper sticker from WND. 
Dean Broyles of the Western Center for Law & Policy, which has been retained to represent the couple, told WND the county’s action not only violates religious land-use laws but also assaults both the First Amendment’s freedom of assembly and freedom of religion. 
“The First Amendment, in part, reads, ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,'” Broyles said. “And that’s the key part: ‘prohibiting the free exercise.’ We believe this is a substantial government burden on the free exercise of religion.”  
He continued, “If one’s home is one’s castle, certainly you would the think the free exercise of religion, of all places, could occur in the home.” 
Broyles confirmed the county official followed through on his threat. The pastor and his wife received a written warning ordering the couple to “cease/stop religious assembly on parcel or obtain a major use permit.” 
“The Western Center for Law and Policy is troubled by this draconian move to suppress home Bible studies,” said the law center in a statement. “If the current trends in our nation continue, churches may be forced underground. If that happens, believers will once again be forced to meet in homes. If homes are already closed by the government to assembly and worship, where then will Christians meet?” 
On a personal note, Broyles added, “I’ve been leading Bible studies in my home for 13 years in San Diego County, and I personally believe that home fellowship Bible studies are the past and future of the church. … If you look at China, the church grew from home Bible studies. I’m deeply concerned that if in the U.S. we are not able to meet in our homes and freely practice our religion, then we may be worse off than China.” 
Broyles also explained to WND that oppressive governments, such as communist China or Nazi Germany, worked to repress home fellowships, labeling them the “underground church” or “subversive groups,” legally compelling Christians to meet only in sanctioned, government-controlled “official” churches. 
“Therein lies my concern,” Broyles said. “If people can’t practice their religious beliefs in the privacy of their own homes with a few of their friends, that’s an egregious First Amendment violation.” 
WND contacted a spokeswoman for San Diego County, who acknowledged the description of the incident seemed “bizarre,” but who was unable to locate the details of the account. She simply could not provide comment yet, she said, until she could become familiar with the case. 
Broyles said the WCLP is nearly ready to file a demand letter with the county to release the pastor and his wife from the requirement to obtain the expensive permit. If the county refuses, Broyles said, the WCLP will consider a lawsuit in federal court. 
Broyles also told WND the pastor and his wife are continuing to hold the Bible study in their home.

Subject: WALKING EAGLE
 Senator Hillary Clinton was invited to address a major gathering of the  American Indian Nation two weeks ago in upper New York State. She spoke  for almost an hour on her future plans for increasing every Native American’s present standard of living, should she one day become the first female President. She referred to her career as a New York  Senator, how she had signed “YES” for every Indian issue that came to her  desk for approval.
  Although the Senator was vague on the details of her plan, she seemed  most enthusiastic about her future ideas for helping her “red sisters and brothers.” At the conclusion of her speech, the Tribes presented the Senator with a plaque inscribed with her new Indian name – Walking Eagle. The proud Senator then departed in her motorcade, waving to the crowds.
  A news reporter later inquired to the group of chiefs of how they come to select the new name given to the Senator. They explained that Walking Eagle is the name given to a bird so full of shit it is unable to fly.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/washmonument/	Religious Significance of the George Washington and the Washington Monument	Mostly Truth!				2015/03/17	"
Subject: The Country Should Know This. I wish all the anti church and state folks knew this.
——————————————————————————————————-
On the aluminum cap atop the Washington Monument in Washington, DC are two
words: Laus Deo. No one can see these words. In fact … most visitors to
the monument have no idea they are even there and … for that matter …
probably could care less!
But there they are … 555 feet, 5.125 inches high … perched atop the
monument to the father of our nation. Overlooking the 69 square miles which
comprise the District of Columbia. capital of the United States of America.
Laus Deo! Two seemingly insignificant, unnoticed words … out of sight and,
one might think, out of mind … but very meaningfully placed at the highest
point over what is the most powerful city in the world.
And what might those two words … comprised of just four syllables and only
seven letters … mean? Very simply … “Praise be to God!”
Though construction of this giant obelisk began in 1848 when James Polk was
President of the United States, it was not until 1888 that the monument was
inaugurated and opened to the public. It took twenty-five years to finally
cap the memorial with the tribute Laus Deo!
“Praise be to God!”
From atop this magnificent granite and marble structure … a visitor can
take in the beautiful panoramic view of the city with its division into four
major segments. And from that vantage point one can also easily see the
original plan of the designer, Pierre Charles l’Enfant … a perfect cross
imposed upon the landscape … with the White House to the North. the
Jefferson Memorial to the South … the Capitol to the East … and the
Lincoln Memorial to the West. A cross … you say?
How interesting! And … no doubt … intended to carry a meaning for those
who bother to notice. “Praise be to God!”
Within the monument itself are 898 steps and 50 landings. As one climbs the
steps and pauses at the landings the memorial stones share a message. On the
12th Landing is a prayer offered by the City of Baltimore; on the 20th is a
memorial presented by some Chinese Christians; on the 24th a presentation
made by Sunday School children from New York and Philadelphia quoting
Proverbs 10:7, Luke 18:16 and Proverbs 22:6. “Praise be to God!”
When the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4th, 1848
deposited within it were many items including the Holy Bible presented by
the Bible Society. Praise be to God! Such was the discipline, the moral
direction, the spiritual mood given by the founder and first President of
our unique democracy … “one nation, under God.”
I am awed by Washington’s prayer for America. Have you never read it?
Well, now is your opportunity … read on!
“Almighty God; We make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United
States in Thy holy protection; that Thou wilt incline the hearts of the
citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government;
and entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their
fellow citizens of the United states at large.” “And finally that Thou wilt
most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy,
and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of
mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed
religion, and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we
can never hope to be a happy nation. Grant our supplication, we beseech
Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”
Laus Deo!
As you might have guessed … I kind of like the idea that our Pledge of
Allegiance includes the phrase “under God.” It is clear when one studies the
history of our great nation that Washington’s America was one of the few
countries in all the world established under the guidance, direction and
banner of Almighty God, to whom was given all praise, honor and worship by
the great men who formed and fashioned her pivotal foundations. And . when
one stops to observe the inscriptions found in public places all over our
nation’s capitol … one will easily find the signature of God.
We are a nation under God!!! Laus Deo!
“Praise be to God!”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/whatiam/	What I am, an ad in the Washington Post written by a passionateRepublican	Truth!				2015/03/17	" What I Am! 
$104,655.60 Ad in the Washington Post
Here is someone with the money to fund a rebuttal to what Howard Dean, Democratic National Committee Chairman, said recently that many Republican have never done an honest day’s work in their life. The following full page ad was placed in the Washington Post by a businessman named George J. Esseff, Sr. He paid $104,655.60 to run the ad and only did it because he is sick and tired of the way that “the rich” are portrayed by liberals these days. It is a great read.
**********************************
Maybe you’re a Republican?
In today’s America ask a growing number of high school and college students, their teachers and professors, the self-anointed media elite and/or hard working men and women of all ethnicities, the question, “What is a Republican?” and you’ll be told “.. a rich, greedy, egotistical individual, motivated only by money and the desire to accumulate more and more of it, at the expense of the environment, the working poor….and all whom they exploit…”
I am a Republican – And I am none of those things….and I don’t know any Republicans who are!
WHAT I AM first and foremost, is a loving husband of some 52 plus years, the father of four and an American who’s proud of his country…and his country’s heritage
WHAT I AM is the grandson of immigrants who risked every-thing, including their lives and those of their children, to escape tyranny in search of freedom.
WHAT I AM is a man who grew up during the Depression and witnessed first hand the effects of the Stock Market crash and the soup lines that followed. I watched as both my parents and grand parents, who had very little themselves, share what food they had with a half dozen other families, who had even less.
WHAT I AM is someone who worked his way through college by holding down three and four jobs at a time and then used that education to build a better life.
WHAT I AM is a husband who at age 24 started his own business for the “privilege” of working 60, 70 and 80 hours a week, risking everything I had including my health, in search of a better life for myself and my loved ones.
WHAT I AM is a businessman whose blood, sweat and tears….and plenty of them…, made it possible for me to provide a secure living not only for my family and myself, but also for literally hundreds of my employees throughout the years. Employees who in turn were able to buy their own homes, raise their own families and give back to their communities and their country.
WHAT I AM is a man who believes in God; a God who has blessed this country… and all for which it stands.
WHAT I AM is someone who knows, if you doubt miracles exist in today’s world, you need only to look into the face of those who received them….and the eyes of those who give them.
WHAT I AM is an American who’s proud that his President embraces a belief in God; proud of a President who understands, as “politically incorrect” as it may be, there is evil in this world and for the security and safety of all freedom loving people everywhere, it must be confronted…and it must be defeated.
WHAT I AM is an American who takes comfort in the knowledge that our President refuses to allow decisions concerning the very safety and security of this nation, to be governed by the political whims of foreign governments.
WHAT I AM is tired of hearing from leading Democrats who see only negativity in America; racism in her people; class warfare in her society and “political incorrectness” in her character.
WHAT I AM is a former democrat who now understands that it is the soldier and not the reporter that guarantees us our freedoms of press, speech and dissent.
WHAT I AM is a man who believes in the sanctity of life. A man who is repulsed by the pandering of the political left for votes, at the expense of the unborn.
WHAT I AM is a husband and father who believes in the sanctity of marriage and the preservation of the family unit.
WHAT I AM is a ex-movie goer who is repulsed by those insecure, socially inept, elementary thinking, ego-inflated “entertainers” who have appointed themselves “experts” in the fields of national security and geo-politics and then use their forum to attack this nation, its leaders and its actions….much to the delight and encouragement of our enemies.
WHAT I AM is an American who understands the difference between “censorship” and “choice.” Evidently, these individuals do not, because when these same “celebrities” receive public ridicule for their offensive actions, the first thing they yell is “censorship.” What they seem incapable of understanding is…the right of free speech and dissent is shared equally by those offended…as well as those who offend. I support and will continue to support those films and performers whom I choose to and refuse to support those I don’t. It is my right as an American a right I will continue to enthusiastically exercise.
WHAT I AM is a voter, tired of politicians who ever time their voting records are subjected to public scrutiny, try to divert attention from their political and legislative failures by accusing their opponents of “attack ads” and “negative campaigning”….and the news media who allow them to get away with it.
WHAT I AM is a Catholic who loves his God and his Faith….and who’s been taught to respect all religions whose teachings are based in love, peace and charity. As such, I am embarrassed and ashamed of those individuals in both private and public life whose decisions and actions are devoid of any sense of character or morals; individuals who are only driven by what’s best for them….rather than what’s right… often times at the expense of many….including our national security. WHAT I AM is a realist who understands that the terrorist attack that murdered hundreds of innocent Russian children could have occurred here, in our heartland. That’s why I sincerely believe America needs now, more than ever, a President who sees with a clear and focused vision and who speaks with a voice when heard by both
friend and foe alike is understood, respected and believed.
WHAT I AM is eternally grateful to Ronald Reagan for having the bravery to speak out against Communism and the courage of his convictions in leading the fight to defeat it; and George W. Bush for the vision, courage, conviction and leadership he has shown in America’s war on terrorism amidst both the constant and vicious, personal and political attacks both he and his family are made to endure.
WHAT I AM is a human being, full of numerous faults and failures, but a man nonetheless who though not always successful has continually strived to do “what’s right” instead of “what’s easy.” A man who is challenging the religious leaders of all faiths, to not only preach to their congregations the fundamentals of “what’s right” and “what’s wrong,” but to also then hold them accountable for their actions in both the public and private sectors.
WHAT I AM is disgusted with the Courts who on one hand call the murder of a pregnant woman a “double homicide,” but then refer to the abortion of her baby as “pro-choice”.
WHAT I AM is someone deeply troubled by a political party which embraces a candidate whose primary “leadership” qualities center around his protesting of the Vietnam war and his labeling the honorable men and women who fought in it, (50,000 of whom gave their lives in that action), as rapists, and war criminals (John Kerry). That same political party then stepped forward this year to block the appearance of a true Vietnam war hero, retired Admiral and former United States Senator, Jeremiah Denton, (a man who spent seven years and seven torturous months in a North Vietnam prison), from speaking before an open session of the California legislature as part of that state’s 4th of July celebration. The reason Democrats gave for refusing to allow this American hero to speak before their state legislature was because of the “conservative” nature of his views. As an American, that troubles me deeply….as well it should you. (Are you listening Mr. D?)
WHAT I AM is a man who feels the need to spend, ONE HUNDRED & FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED & FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($104, 655.60, tax paid) of his own money, to purchase this advertisement, in order to set the story straight. Some may say this money would have been better spent feeding the world’s poor. At the risk of sounding self-serving, as an American and as a Republican, for the last six decades of my life, I have done exactly that…and more. Following the examples of my parents and grand parents, I have used my earnings to feed the poor, shelter the homeless, provide housing for the elderly and medical care for the sick…..and continue to do so…and I’m not alone in that work.
WHAT I AM is someone who is paying for this announcement at my sole expense in hopes of opening the eyes of those led blindly by ill-informed elements of our great nation, who, through either ignorance, or malicious intent, repeatedly attack and belittle those of us who belong to a political party that holds true to the belief, “The rights of the governed, exceed the power of the government.” For those interested, I am speaking only as a tax-paying individual who is in no way associated with the Republican National Committee, nor with any of its directors, or delegates.
WHAT I AM is a man who understands, “the American way of life” is a message of self-empowerment for all.
WHAT I AM is an American who is grateful that our nation gives each of us the opportunity of self-determination and the right to benefit from the fruits of self achievement.
WHAT I AM is an American who wants to preserve that way of life for all who seek it.
WHAT I AM is blessed to be an American…. and proud to be a Republican.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/vincent/	Bruce Vincent's encounter with the president	Truth!				2015/03/17	" For those of us who sometimes find ourselves having doubts about our President, here is an excellent piece— worth every minute it takes to read it.
 This is from a man, Bruce Vincent, from Montana who received an award from the President. 
 He writes: I’ve written the following narrative to chronicle the day of the award ceremony in DC. I’m still working on a press release but the White House press corps has yet to provide a photo to go with it. When the photo comes I’ll ship it out. When you get done reading this you’ll understand the dilemma I face in telling this story beyond my circle of close friends.
 The moment with the President in the Oval Office was incredible. I want to protect the memory because it was an intensely private moment between two men. At the same time I’d like to share it on a broader scale because I’d like others to know what I know about the man sitting at the desk in the Oval Office. For now, I’ll just tell it to you folks. 
As you know, our efforts concerning the reintroduction of our rural, resource providing cultures to the ever more urbane society of our nation has been honored with an award from the President and First Lady Bush. Nominated by the Forest Service for the first ever Preserve America President’s Award was our cultural exchange program Provider PalsT and our restoration of an abandoned CCC built Forest Service ranger station (Raven Ranger Station) for use as a learning center for students from throughout the nation that are now engaged in our cultural exchange.
The award was given at a White House ceremony on Monday, May 3. Guests at the East Room ceremony (the Rose Garden was going to be used but it rained) included Secretary of Interior Gorton, Secretary of Agriculture Venneman, Undersecretary Mark Rey, Chief Bosworth, President’s Advisory Council for Preserve America, and others. The East Wing was closed to the public for the event and those who attended enjoyed brunch and live chamber music.
Provider PalsT was able to bring members of our board of directors, staff from our partner Communities for a Great Northwest, our Kootenai Forest Supervisor and Forest Archaeologist, and two officials from our major sponsor Ford Motor Company. Thankfully, I was also able to bring PJ and all four children. In the East Room, Secretaries Venneman and Gorton spoke as did First Lady Bush and Preserve America’s Chairman John Nau.
The First Lady then gave autographed copies of a White House book to award winners in this ceremony and posed for pictures. When the ceremony concluded, the First Lady stayed for a bit in the Green Room and chatted and posed for pictures. She was then escorted outside to meet the President and board a Marine One helicopter waiting to whisk them off to the airport. For me, however, the biggest event of the day had already happened when the East Room Ceremony started up. While the East Room ceremony was being prepared, the four national award winners and the entities that nominated them were taken to the Oval Office for the official award presentation by President Bush and First Lady Bush. There were eight of us in total. Stepping into the Oval Office, each of us was introduced to the President and Mrs. Bush. We shook hands and participated in small talk. When the President was told that we were from Libby, Montana, I reminded him that Marc Racicot is our native son and the President offered his warm thoughts about Governor Racicot. I have to tell you, I was blown away by two things upon entering the office. First, the Oval Office sense of ‘place’ is unreal. The President later shared a story of Russian President Putin entering the room prepared to tackle the President in a tough negotiation and upon entering the atheist muttered his first words to the President and they were “Oh, my God.” I concurred. I could feel the history in my bones. Second, the man that inhabits the office engaged me with a firm handshake and a look that can only be described as penetrating. Warm, alive, fully engaged, disarmingly penetrating. I was admittedly concerned about meeting the man. I think all of us have an inner hope that the most powerful man in our country is worthy of the responsibility and authority that we bestow upon them through our vote. I admit that part of me was afraid that I would be let down by the moment – that the person and the place could not meet the lofty expectations of my fantasy world. This says nothing about my esteem for President Bush but just my practical realization that reality may not match my ‘dream.’ Once inside the office, President Bush got right down to business and, standing in front of his desk, handed out the awards one at a time while posing for photos with the winners and Mrs. Bush. With the mission accomplished, the President and Mrs. Bush relaxed and initiated a lengthy, informal conversation about a number of things with our entire small group. He and the First Lady talked about such things as the rug in the office. It is traditionally designed by the First Lady to make a statement about the President, and Mrs. Bush chose a brilliant yellow sunburst pattern to reflect ‘hope.’ President Bush talked about the absolute need to believe that with hard work and faith in God there is every reason to start each day in the Oval Office with hope. He and the First Lady were asked about the impact of the Presidency on their marriage and, with an arm casually wrapped around Laura, he said that he thought the place may be hard on weak marriages but that it had the ability to make strong marriages even stronger and that he was blessed with a strong one. When asked what the biggest challenge of the Presidency was, he talked about the daily frustration of partisan politics. ‘This from a politician,’ he said. He said that when he was elected he promised that he would do in DC what he had done in Texas and that was build alliances and coalitions that bridged party lines in order to move the nation forward. He had quickly learned that there are those in the nation’s capital that would rather see the nation dismantled than work together to achieve a common good. That, he said is a bitter and continuing disappointment. The President talked about the artwork and other items of interest in the room. For instance the desk he uses is the one that was given to the U.S. by Queen Victoria and used by FDR and JFK. In fact FDR had a front panel added to the desk to cover the mid section because FDR did not want
the country to know he was in a wheelchair. President Bush laughed and said, “My how things have changed, FDR hid a wheelchair and if I eat a pretzel and get a tingle in my arm it’s front page news around the globe.” That little desk faux front is hinged by the way, and is the door that we all have seen John-John sticking his head from behind in the famous photo of JFK at work. The President also noted that much of the artwork in the office is from Texas or about Texas. He said that it made sense for him to have it in his office because Texas is part of who he is. He talked about family and place and faith helping to build the person you end up being and noted that the Oval Office reflected who he is. He noted that it would be a mistake to come to the Oval Office and entertain a mission to ‘find yourself.’ He said that with all of the pressures and responsibilities that go with the job, you’d best know who you are when you put your nameplate on the desk in the Oval Office. He said he knows who he is and now America has had four years to learn about who he is. If they like what they see, he may have another four years. If not, then he may be going back to Texas. After about 30 or 35 minutes, it was time to go. By then we were all relaxed and I felt as if I had just had an excellent visit with a friend. The President and First Lady made one more pass down the line of awardees, shaking hands and offering congratulations. When the President shook my hand I said, “thank you Mr. President and God bless you and your family.” He was already in motion to the next person in line, but he stopped abruptly, turned fully back to me, gave me a piercing look, renewed the vigor of his handshake and said, “Thank you – and God bless you and yours as well.” On our way out of the office we were to leave by the glass doors on the west side of the office. I was the last person in the exit line. As I shook his hand one final time, President Bush said, “I’ll be sure to tell Marc hello and give him your regards.” I then did something that surprised even me. I said to him, “Mr. President, I know you are a busy man and your time is precious. I also know you to be a man of strong faith and have a favor to ask you.” As he shook my hand he looked me in the eye and said, “Just name it.”
I told him that my step-Mom was at that moment in a hospital in Kalispell, Montana, having a tumor removed from her skull and it would mean a great deal to me if he would consider adding her to his prayers that day. He grabbed me by the arm and took me back toward his desk as he said, “So that’s it. I could tell that something is weighing heavy on your heart today. I could see it in your eyes. This explains it.” From the top drawer of his desk he retrieved a pen and a note card with his seal on it and asked, “How do you spell her name?” He then jotted a note to her while discussing the importance of family and the strength of prayer. When he handed me the card, he asked about the surgery and the prognosis. I told him we were hoping that it is not a recurrence of an earlier cancer and that if it is they can get it all with this surgery. He said, “If it’s okay with you, we’ll take care of the prayer right now. Would you pray with me?” I told him yes and he turned to the staff that remained in the office and hand motioned the folks to step back or leave. He said, “Bruce and I would like some private time for a prayer.” As they left he turned back to me and took my hands in his. I was prepared to do a traditional prayer stance – standing with each other with heads bowed. Instead, he reached for my head with his right hand and pulling gently forward, he placed my head on his shoulder. With his left arm on my mid back, he pulled me to him in a prayerful embrace. He started to pray softly. I started to cry. He continued his prayer for Loretta and for God’s perfect will to be done. I cried some more. My body shook a bit as I cried and he just held tighter. He closed by asking God’s blessing on Loretta and the family during the coming months. I stepped away from our embrace, wiped my eyes, swiped at the tears I’d left on his shoulder, and looked into the eyes of our President. I thanked him as best I could and told him that me and my family would continue praying for he and his.
As I write this account down and reflect upon what it means, I have to tell you that all I really know is that his simple act left me humbled and believing. I so hoped that the man I thought him to be was the man that he is. I know that our nation needs a man such as this in the Oval Office. George W. Bush is the real deal. I’ve read Internet stories about the President praying with troops in hospitals and other such uplifting accounts. Each time I read them I hope them to be true and not an Internet perpetuated myth. This one, I know to be true. I was there. He is real. He has a pile of incredible stuff on his plate each day – and yet he is tuned in so well to the here and now that he ‘sensed’ something heavy on my heart. He took time out of his life to care, to share, and to seek God’s blessing for my family in a simple man-to-man, father-to-father, son-to-son, husband-to-husband, Christian-to-Christian prayerful embrace. He’s not what I had hoped he would be. He is, in fact, so very, very much more.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/zell-miller/	A Democrat criticizes the 9/11 Commission	Truth!				2015/03/17	" 
Subject: ZELL MILLERS SPEECH (He’s the best Republican any Democrat could be!!!)
On C-SPAN THIS IS A SPEECH YESTERDAY (April 8th) BY SENATOR ZELL MILLER.” A MUST READ
The PRESIDING OFFICER: The Senator from Georgia.
Mr. MILLER: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak up to 15 minutes as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
SUBJECT: THE 9/11 COMMISSION
Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, after watching the harsh acrimony generated by the September 11 Commission–which, let me say at the outset, is made up of good and able members–I have come to seriously question this panel’s usefulness. I believe it will ultimately play a role in doing great harm to this country, for its unintended consequences, I fear, will be to energize our enemies and demoralize our troops.
After being drowned in a tidal wave of all who didn’t do enough before 9/11, I have come to believe that the Commission should issue a report that says: No one did enough. In the past, no one did near enough. And then thank everybody for serving, send them home, and let’s get on with the job of protecting this country in the future.
Tragically, these hearings have proved to be a very divisive diversion for this country. Tragically, they have devoured valuable time looking backward instead of looking forward. Can you imagine handling the attack on Pearl Harbor this way? Can you imagine Congress, the media, and the public standing for this kind of political gamesmanship and finger-pointing after that day of infamy in 1941?
Some partisans tried that ploy, but they were soon quieted by the patriots who understood how important it was to get on with the war and take the battle to America ‘s enemies and not dwell on what FDR knew, when. You see, back then the highest priority was to win a war, not to win an election. That is what made them the greatest generation.
I realize that many well-meaning Americans see the hearings as democracy in action. Years ago when I was teaching political science, I probably would have had my class watching it live on television and using that very same phrase with them.
There are also the not-so-well-meaning political operatives who see these hearings as an opportunity to score cheap points. And then there are the media meddlers who see this as great theater that can be played out on the evening news and on endless talk shows for a week or more.
Congressional hearings have long been one of Washington’s most entertaining pastimes. Joe McCarthy, Watergate, Iran-Contra–they all kept us glued to the TV and made for conversations around the water coolers or arguments over a beer at the corner pub. A congressional hearing in Washington, DC is the ultimate aphrodisiac for political groupies and partisan punks. But it is not the groupies, punks, and television-sotted American public that I am worried about This latter crowd can get excited and divided over just about anything, whether it is some off-key wannabe dreaming of being the American idol, or what brainless bimbo “The Bachelor” or “Average Joe” will choose, or who Donald Trump will fire next week. No, it is the real enemies of America that I am concerned about. These evil killers who right now are gleefully watching the shrill partisan finger-pointing of these hearings and grinning like a mule eating briars.
They see this as a major split within the great Satan, America . They see anger. They see division, instability, bickering, peevishness, and dissension. They see the President of the United States hammered unmercifully. They see all this, and they are greatly encouraged.
We should not be doing anything to encourage our enemies in this battle between good and evil. Yet these hearings, in my opinion, are doing just that. We are playing with fire. We are playing directly into the hands of our enemy by allowing these hearings to become the great divider they have become.
Dick Clarke’s book and its release coinciding with these hearings have done this country a tremendous disservice and some day we will reap its whirlwind.
Long ago, Sir Walter Scott observed that revenge is“the sweetest morsel that ever was cooked in hell.”
The vindictive Clarke has now had his revenge, but what kind of hell has he, his CBS publisher, and his axe-to-grind advocates unleashed?
These hearings, coming on the heels of the election the terrorists influenced in Spain , bolster and energize our evil enemies as they have not been energized since 9/11.
Chances are very good that these evil enemies of America will attempt to influence our 2004 election in a similar dramatic way as they did Spain,s. And to think that could never be in this country is to stick your head in the sand.
That is why the sooner we stop this endless bickering over the past and join together to prepare for the future, the better off this country will be. There are some things–whether this city believes it or not–that are just more important than political campaigns. The recent past is so ripe for political second-guessing, “gotcha,” and Monday morning quarterbacking. And it is so tempting in an election year. We should not allow ourselves to indulge that temptation. We should put our country first.
Every administration, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, bears some of the blame. Dick Clarke bears a big heap of it, because it was he who was in the catbird’s seat to do something about it for more than a decade. Tragically, it was the decade in which we did the least.
We did nothing after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in 1993, killing six and injuring more than a thousand Americans.
We did nothing in 1996 when 16 U.S. servicemen were killed in the bombing of the Khobar Towers .
When our embassies were attacked in 1998, killing 263 people, our only response was to fire a few missiles on an empty tent.
Is it any wonder that after that decade of weak-willed responses to that murderous terror, our enemies thought we would never fight back?
In the 1990s is when Dick Clarke should have resigned. In the 1990s is when he should have apologized. That is when he should have written his book–that is, if he really had America ‘s best interests at heart.
Now, I know some will say we owe it to the families to get more information about what happened i
n the past, and I can understand that. But no amount of finger-pointing will bring our victims back
So now we owe it to the future families and all of America now in jeopardy not to encourage more terrorists, resulting in even more grieving families–perhaps many times over the ones of 9/11.
It is obvious to me that this country is rapidly dividing itself into two camps–the wimps and the warriors : the ones who want to argue and assess and appease, and the ones who want to carry this fight to our enemies and kill them before they kill us. In case you have not figured it out, I proudly belong to the latter.
This is a time like no other time in the history of this country. This country is being crippled with petty partisan politics of the worst possible kind. In time of war, it is not just unpatriotic; it is stupid; it is criminal.
So I pray that all this time, all this energy, all this talk, and all of the attention could be focused on the future instead of the past.
I pray we would stop pointing fingers and assigning blame and wringing our hands about what happened on that day David AcUology has called “the worst day in all our history” more than 2 years ago, and instead, pour all our energy into how we can kill these terrorists before they kill us–again.
Make no mistake about it: They are watching these hearings and they are scheming and smiling about the distraction and the divisiveness that they see in America . And while they might not know who said it years ago in America , they know instinctively that a house divided cannot stand.
There is one other group that we should remember is listening to all of this–our troops.
I was in Iraq in January. One day, when I was meeting with the 1st Armored Division, a unit with a proud history, known as Old Ironsides, we were discussing troop morale, and the commanding general said it was top notch.
I turned to the division’s sergeant major, the top enlisted man in the division, a big, burly 6-foot-3, 240 pound African American, and I said: “That’s good, but how do you sustain that kind of morale?”
Without hesitation, he narrowed his eyes, and he looked at me and said: “The morale will stay high just as long as these troops know the people back home support us.”
Just as long as the people back home support us. What kind of message are these hearings and the outrageously political speeches on the floor of the Senate yesterday sending to the marvelous young Americans in the uniform of our country? I say: Unite America before it is too late. Put aside these petty partisan differences when it comes to the protection of our people. Argue and argue and argue, debate and debate and debate over all the other things, such as jobs, education, the deficit, and the environment; but please, please do not use the lives of Americans and the security of this country as a cheap-shot political talking point.
I yield the floor.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/edwards-flu/	Vice Presidential Candidate John Edwards is the Attorney Responsible For Events that Lead Up to the 2004 Flu Vaccine Shortage	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"  Version #1
 Subject: Fw: Flu Vaccine
  Read all the way to the bottom for a startling revelation about who is  really responsible the flu vaccine shortage:
   Take the time to read this . . . it’s very interesting.  
   How Flu Vaccine works:   Influenza vaccine is produced by growing the virus in eggs. The virus   is killed and processed to create the vaccine, which is given by   injection under the skin. The body then produces antibodies to the virus   over the next two to four weeks. If the immunized person then comes into   contact with the influenza virus, the antibodies attack and kill the   virus before it has a chance to cause infection. The vaccine contains   the 3 most   likely strains to be active during the “flu season”     Why the shortage:   Almost half of the nation’s flu vaccine will not be delivered this   year. Chiron, a major manufacturer of flu vaccine, will not be   distributing any influenza vac! cine this flu season. Chiron was to make   46-48 million doses vaccine for the United States. Chiron is a British   company. Recently British health officials stopped Chiron from   distributing and making the vaccine when inspectors found unsanitary   conditions in the labs. Some lots of the vaccine were recalled and   destroyed.     Why is our vaccine made in the UK and not the US?   The major pharmaceutical companies in the US provided almost 90% of the   nations flu vaccine at one time. They did this despite a very low profit   margin for the product. Basically, they were doing us a favor. In the   late 80’s a man from North Carolina who had received the vaccine got the   flu. The strain he caught was one of the strains in that years vaccine   made by a US company. What did he do? He sued and he won. He was   awarded almost $5 million! After that case was appealed and lost, most   US pharmaceutical companies stopped making the vaccine. The liability   out w! eighed the profit margin. Since UK and Canadian laws prohibit   such frivolous law suits UK and Canadian companies began selling the   vaccine in the US.     By the way…the lawyer that represented the man in the flu shot law   suit was a young ambulance chaser by the name of John Edwards.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/jay-carney-soviet-posters/	White House Press Secretary Jay Carney’s Soviet Propaganda Posters	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Why do Jay Carney and Claire Shipman decorate their house with Soviet propaganda posters?

The moral blindness of the American Ruling Class is on display. The Washingtonian Magazine, a glossy lifestyle and politics rag, has published a fawning profile of D.C. power couple Jay Carney and Claire Shipman that was a bit more revealing than intended. At the top of the piece was a photo of mom Claire with her son and daughter, flipping a fried egg in their beautiful kitchen/great room.
Ms. Shipman appears the absolute epitome of a have-it-all contemporary woman, able to work at a powerful and glamorous job (part-time at ABC News), raise two adorable children, and maintain the type of house most Americans can only dream about, while hubby works directly for the POTUS and faces the national media daily. Oh, and at 51 she is still beautiful.
What could possibly be a fly in the ointment of the picture of perfection?
Well, how about those Soviet propaganda posters in the background? The Week noticed, and highlighted them, and Drudge put the story up.
Now, to be fair, both sides of the power couple studied Russian during their Ivy League educations (he: Yale, she: Columbia) and became Moscow correspondents for major news agencies (he: TIME Magazine back when it still mattered, she: CNN), where they met prior to the fall of the USSR. But the fact that they seem to be nostalgic for the communist era tells us a lot.
While life among the Moscow elite may have been fairly comfortable, it was not so for scores of millions of victims of the regime, less well-connected or ideologically heterodox. In fact, as The Black Book of Communism informs us, communism killed more people than even Nazism. With their fancy Ivy League educations, the Power Couple ought to know this.
How many foreign correspondents in Berlin in the 1930s (people like William L. Shirer) brought home Nazi propaganda posters and raised their children among them?
The sad fact is that progressives in much of the developed world have a soft spot in their hearts for communism. Yeah, it murdered a hundred million people or more, but you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. And those who were murdered were not very fashionable, for the most part.
The Washingtonian photo is a tell. There is a sickness, a willful blindness toward the crimes of communism because it is so close to the progressive ideology that animates the American Ruling Class. Shipman and Carney are the perfect exemplars of that class. Smart, fit, busy, anxious to make their own lives perfect, and convinced that the price other people pay for their progressive dreams is not worth mentioning or even noticing.

 The book, in this midterm election year, is a strong rebuttal of the progressive ideology behind President Obama’s policies, which have been supported by Costco co-founder and director Jim Sinegal, a major Democrat donor and a speaker at the 2012 Democratic National Convention that nominated the president.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-watergate/	Hillary Clinton's former boss fired her for unethical behavior while she was working on the Watergate investigation.	Not True	['congress', 'hillary clinton', 'watergate']			2015/03/17	"2013 Version:


FLASHBACK: HILLARY CLINTON FIRED FROM WATERGATE INVESTIGATION FOR FOR ‘LYING, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR’
The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary’s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther … and goes much deeper … than anyone realizes.
Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee. Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor, Burke Marshall, who was also Sen. Ted Kennedy’s chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair. When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation … one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman’s 17-year career.
Why?
“Because she was a liar,” Zeifman said in an interview last week. “She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.”
How could a 27-year-old House staff member do all that? She couldn’t do it by herself, but Zeifman said she was one of several individuals … including Marshall, special counsel John Doar and senior associate special counsel (and future Clinton White House Counsel) Bernard Nussbaum … who engaged in a seemingly implausible scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigation.
Why would they want to do that? Because, according to Zeifman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E. Howard Hunt on the stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president. Hunt, Zeifman said, had the goods on nefarious activities in the Kennedy Administration that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach… including Kennedy’s purported complicity in the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro.
The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats, up to and including then-House Majority Leader Tip O’Neill, that Nixon clearly had the right to counsel. Zeifman says that Hillary, along with Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar, was determined to gain enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to change House rules and deny counsel to Nixon. And in order to pull this off, Zeifman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief, and confiscated public documents to hide her deception.
The brief involved precedent for representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding. When Hillary endeavored to write a legal brief arguing there is no right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding, Zeifman says, he told Hillary about the case of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who faced an impeachment attempt in 1970.
“As soon as the impeachment resolutions were introduced by (then-House Minority Leader Gerald) Ford, and they were referred to the House Judiciary Committee, the first thing Douglas did was hire himself a lawyer,” Zeifman said.
The Judiciary Committee allowed Douglas to keep counsel, thus establishing the precedent. Zeifman says he told Hillary that all the documents establishing this fact were in the Judiciary Committee’s public files.
So what did Hillary do?
“Hillary then removed all the Douglas files to the offices where she was located, which at that time was secured and inaccessible to the public,”Zeifman said. Hillary then proceeded to write a legal brief arguing there was no precedent for the right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding … as if the Douglas case had never occurred.
The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zeifman believes Hillary would have been disbarred if she had submitted it to a judge.http://patdollard.com/2013/05/flashback-hillary-clinton-fired-from-watergate-investigation-for-lying-unethical-behavior-conspiracy-to-violate-the-constitution/

Original eRumor as it appeared in 2008:
Watergate-Era Judiciary Chief of Staff: Hillary Clinton Fired For Lies, Unethical Behavior
by Dan Calabrese Dan Calabrese
As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper fire in Bosnia, one question that arose was whether she has engaged in a pattern of lying.
The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary’s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther – and goes much deeper – than anyone realizes.
Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee.

The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zeifman believes Hillary would have been disbarred if she had submitted it to a judge.
Zeifman says that if Hillary, Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar had succeeded, members of the House Judiciary Committee would have also been denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, and denied the opportunity to even participate in the drafting of articles of impeachment against Nixon.
Of course, Nixon’s resignation rendered the entire issue moot, ending Hillary’s career on the Judiciary Committee staff in a most undistinguished manner. Zeifman says he was urged by top committee members to keep a diary of everything that was happening. He did so, and still has the diary if anyone wants to check the veracity of his story. Certainly, he could not have known in 1974 that diary entries about a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham would be of interest to anyone 34 years later.
But they show that the pattern of lies, deceit, fabrications and unethical behavior was established long ago – long before the Bosnia lie, and indeed, even before cattle futures, Travelgate and Whitewater – for the woman who is still asking us to make her president of the United States.

Congressional Reform Act of 2011
1. Term Limits.
12 years only, one of the possible options below..
A. Two Six-year Senate terms
B. Six Two-year House terms
C. One Six-year Senate term and three Two-Year House terms
2. No Tenure / No Pension.
A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are
out of office.
3. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security.
All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people.
4. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.
5. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.
6. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people.
7. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people.
8. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 1/1/11.
The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen. Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves! Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work.

 Bill & Hillary, 1970  
BILL CLINTON’S MILITARY CAREER: 
Bill & Hillary – Grit your teeth before you read this!) 
Bill Clinton registers for the draft on September 08, 1964, accepting all contractual conditions of registering for the draft.  Selective Service Number is 326 46 228. 
Bill Clinton classified 2-S on November 17, 1964. 
Bill Clinton reclassified 1-A on March 20, 1968. 
Bill Clinton ordered to report for induction on July 28, 1969. 
Bill Clinton refuses to report and is not inducted into the military. 
Bill Clinton reclassified 1-D after enlisting in the United States Army Reserves on August 07, 1969, under authority of COL. E. Holmes. 
Clinton signs enlistment papers and takes oath of enlistment. Bill Clinton fails to report to his duty station at the University of Arkansas ROTC, September 1969. 
Bill Clinton reclassified 1- A on October 30, 1969, as enlistment with Army Reserves is revoked by Colonel E. Holmes and Clinton now AWOL and subject to arrest under Public Law 90-40 (2)(a) registrant who has failed to report…remain liable for induction. 
Bill Clinton’s birth date lottery number is 311, drawn December 1, 1969, but anyone who has already been ordered to report for induction is INELIGIBLE! 
Bill Clinton runs for Congress (1974), while a fugitive from justice under Public Law 90-40. 
Bill Clinton runs for Arkansas Attorney General (1976), while a fugitive from justice. 
Bill Clinton receives pardon on January 21, 1977, from President James Earl Carter. 
Bill Clinton becomes the FIRST PARDONED FEDERAL FELON ever to serve as President of the United States. 
All these facts come from Freedom of Information requests, public laws, and various books that have been published, and have not been refuted by Clinton. 
After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, President Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 
After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five U.S. military personnel, Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 
After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 U.S. military personnel, Clintonpromised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 
After the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 and injured 5,000, Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 
After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39 U.S. sailors, Clinton promised that those responsible be hunted down and punished. 
Maybe if Clinton had kept those promises, an estimated 3,000 people in New York and Washington, DC. who are now dead would be alive today.

THINK ABOUT IT! It is a strange turn of events. Hillary gets $8 Million for her forthcoming memoir.  Bill gets about $12 Million for his memoir yet to be written. This from two people who spent 8 years being unable to recall anything about past events while under oath.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/bowe-bergdahl/	Comrades Allege Bergdahl Desertion	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Army Times Facebook post on this Bergdahl character from a guy in his unit, Dan Witmer:

You want it from the horses mouth?? Here ya go..We were at OP Mest, Paktika Province, Afghanistan. It was a small outpost where B Co 1-501st INF (Airbone) ran operations out of, just an Infantry platoon and ANA counterparts there. The place was an Afghan graveyard. Bergdahl had been acting a little strange, telling people he wanted to “walk the earth” and kept a little journal talking about how he was meant for better things. No one thought anything about it. He was a little “out there”. Next morning he’s gone. We search everywhere, and can’t find him. He left his weapon, his kit, and other sensitive items. He only took some water, a compass and a knife. We find some afghan kids shortly after who saw an american walking north asking about where the taliban are. We get hits on our voice intercepter that Taliban has him, and we were close. We come to realize that the kid deserted his post, snuck out of camp and sought out Taliban… to join them. We were in a defensive position at OP Mest, where your focus is to keep people out. He knew where the blind spots were to slip out and that’s what he did. It was supposed to be a 4-day mission but turned into several months of active searching. Everyone was spun up to find this guy. News outlets all over the country were putting out false information. It was hard to see, especially when we knew the truth about what happened and we lost good men trying to find him. PFC Matthew Michael Martinek, Staff Sgt. Kurt Robert Curtiss, SSG Clayton Bowen, PFC Morris Walker, SSG Michael Murphrey, 2LT Darryn Andrews, were all KIA from our unit who died looking for Bergdahl. Many others from various units were wounded or killed while actively looking for Bergdahl. Fighting Increased. IEDs and enemy ambushes increased. The Taliban knew that we were looking for him in high numbers and our movements were predictable. Because of Bergdahl, more men were out in danger, and more attacks on friendly camps and positions were conducted while we were out looking for him. His actions impacted the region more than anyone wants to admit. There is also no way to know what he told the Taliban: Our movements, locations, tactics, weak points on vehicles and other things for the enemy to exploit are just a few possibilities. The Government knows full well that he deserted. It looks bad and is a good propaganda piece for the Taliban. They refuse to acknowledge it. Hell they even promoted him to Sergeant which makes me sick. I feel for his family who only want their son/brother back. They don’t know the truth, or refuse to acknowledge it as well. What he did affected his family and his whole town back home, who don’t know the truth. Either way what matters is that good men died because of him. He has been lying on all those Taliban videos about everything since his “capture”. If he ever returns, he should be tried under the UCMJ for being a deserter and judged for what he did. Bergdahl is not a hero, he is not a soldier or an Infantryman. He failed his brothers. Now, sons and daughters are growing up without their fathers who died for him and he will have to face that truth someday.”

I WAS THERE: My perspective on Bowe Bergdahl
Posted by Jon Williams on June 04, 2014
by Jon Williams (http://www.iamatexan.com/)
As an Army Veteran who was working as a contractor attached to the 25th Infantry Division (same Division as Bergdahl) in a nearby FOB when Bowe Bergdahl went missing, I feel the need to speak out on the situation (notice I don’t ascribe rank to him, I will address that later).
A few days ago, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel took the stage at Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan and excitedly started with what he thought would be a big applause line. “We got him back!” he exclaimed.
Silence.
Not. Even. One. Clap.
Numerous White House leaks show that Obama and his team were convinced that Americans would greet the news of a returning POW with elation; that this would be the great moment in Obama’s second term. This shows just how clueless they are about the military. Let me clue them in.
You see, when Hagel took the stage, he expected joy at the announcement that one of their own was returned! However, you have to see inside a soldier’s mind to understand what was going on here. I believe I can provide a little insight.
When a soldier deserts his post, when he writes that he is ashamed to be an American, when he gives the enemy secrets (and he did), he is no longer “one of us”. He is a traitor. He is not a brother-in-arms.
Soldiers risk their lives for each other every day on the battlefield, there is a trust and respect they have for each other. For Bowe Bergdahl to break that trust and the Secretary of Defense to announce a hero’s welcome instead of a court-martial is a huge let-down.
He isn’t one of their own. He is one of them. He is the enemy.
That’s not something to celebrate.
The message the White House is sending is that they value treason more than honorable service.
Read that last sentence again. Let it sink in. THIS is what every soldier is thinking.
In a soldier’s mind serving with honor means finishing your tour, even if you disagree with the way things are done. All bets are off if you serve with dishonor.
I do not refer to Bergdahl as a sergeant, even though he received “automatic” promotions while in the Taliban’s custody because according to law, after 30 days his rank and pay should have been stripped from him. Due to political pressure, his was not. In fact, he probably has over $200,000 in cash waiting in his bank account. In my opinion, this money should be given to the families of the soldiers who died in the aftermath of his desertion.
Bowe Bergdahl deserted his post. He served with dishonor. I know that firsthand. Our soldiers know that. They know they risk their lives every day. They don’t get a hero’s welcome from the White House, they get fewer meals (due to budget constraints) and less safety equipment (due to the draw-down).
Let me be perfectly clear. A Rose Garden Ceremony, a “hero’s welcome”, and automatic promotions to a person that deserted is nothing more than a slap in the face to every service member who has served honorably.
That, Mr. President and Mr. Hagel, is why soldiers aren’t clapping and applauding for you. That is why you have lost any remaining respect from the military community.

So, Jesse Jackson, Jr. 17 year veteran of the US Congress, suddenly gets a “mood disorder” (about the same time he learned he was to be indicted) and is going to prison for 2.5 years. Because his “mood disorder” was so severe, he has become disabled and will receive $8700 per month as a disability payment as well as $45000 a year from his congressional pension, a total of about $150K per year.
Is this a great country or what?
By the way, I have had a rather substantial “mood disorder disability” ever since Obama got elected in 2008.

On page 425 it says in black and white that EVERYONE on Social Security, (will include all Senior Citizens and SSI people) will go to MANDATORY counseling every 5 years to learn and to choose from ways to end your suffering (and your life). Health care will be denied based on age. 500 Billion will be cut from Seniors healthcare. The only way for that to happen is to drastically cut health care, the oldest and the sickest will be cut first.
Now, CALL YOUR PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tell them to read page 425 if they don’t read anything else. Surely they have parents.

Subject: Shock to NBC this morning
An Indianapolis doctor’s letter to Sen. Bayh about the Bill. Dr.
Stephen E. Fraser, practices as an anesthesiologist in
Indianapolis, IN ) Here is a letter he sent to Senator Bayh..
Feel free to copy it and send it around to all other representatives.
Senator Bayh,
As a practicing physician I have major concerns with the health
care bill before Congress. I actually have read the bill and am shocked
by the brazenness of the government’s proposed involvement in the
patient-physician relationship. The very idea that the government will
dictate and ration patient care is dangerous and certainly not helpful
in
designing a health care system that works for all. Every
physician I work with agrees that we need to fix our health care system,
but the proposed bills currently making their way through congress will
be a disaster if passed.
I ask you respectfully and as a patriotic American to look at
the following troubling lines that I have read in the bill. You cannot
possibly believe that these proposals are in the best interests of the
country and our fellow citizens.

“Finally, it is specifically stated that this bill will not apply to members of Congress. Members of Congress are already exempt from the Social Security system, and have a well-funded private plan that covers their retirement needs.

ISIS vs. ISIL




If you’ve wondered, as I have, why all government agencies and especially BHO calls it 
ISIL and even spells it out every time it’s used instead of ISIS as the rest of the world here’s the answer. 


Decoding Obamas speech reveals some startling revelations 
And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. Genesis 12:3 
In one press conference after another, when referring to the Muslim terror super-group ISIS, United States President Barack Obama will use the term I S I L instead of their former name I S I S or current name Islamic State. Have you ever wondered about that? We have. 


What makes up the near exact center of the Muslim Levant? Israel. 
ISIL stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. Now, to us Westerners we dont really make much of a distinction, do we? No, honestly from our perspective its all about the same. But how would a Muslim living in the Middle East view it? Just what is the Levant anyway? Lets take a look. 
The geographical term LEVANT refers to a multi-nation region in the Middle East. Its a land bridge between Turkey to the north and Egypt to the south. If you look on a map, however, in the near exact middle of the nations that comprise the Levant, guess what you see? Come on, guess! 
Its Israel. 
When Barack Obama refers over and over to the Islamic State as ISIL, he is sending a message to Muslims all over the Middle East that he personally does not recognize Israel as a sovereign nation, but as territory belonging to the Islamic State. 
Now you know why Obama says that he has no plan, no goal, and no stated aim for dealing with ISIS. But he does have a plan, and its a really nasty, diabolical one. Obamas plan is to drag his feet for as long as he can, doing only the bare minimum that Congress forces him to do. His plan to buy ISIS as much time as possible to make as many gains as they can. 
Listen as Obama and his press secretary and the spokesperson for the State Department and his Joint Chief’s of Staff painstakingly spells out the letters I-S-I-L so there is no doubt in your mind: 
And its working. 
The Islamic State has garnered millions of dollars, a vast cache of weapons, and in their latest foray have captured Syrian fighter jets and now 12 commercial passenger planes. With each passing day that Obama fulfills his stated aim of doing nothing, the Islamic State grows by leaps and bounds. The ultimate goal, of course, has not changed and will never change. 
The ultimate goal is the destruction of Israel. 
Now you know a little bit more why Obama chooses his words so carefully, and what’s really in a name. Shakespeare had it right.

GANG LEADER ADMITS “ERIC HOLDER PAID US TO START RIOTS”



Ferguson Gang Leader Admits “Eric Holder Paid Us To Start Riots… Eric Holder’s career has survived a long list of scandals; The 2008 Black Panther debacle, overturning Arizona’s immigration laws and ‘Fast and Furious‘ immediately spring to mind. These, however, pale in comparison to the recent allegations against Holder, the likes of which could easily land the Attorney General behind bars.
 Evidence has been uncovered showing Eric Holder contributed funds to Ferguson’s gang population as incentive to loot and spread civil unrest in the area. These angry, government-sponsored terrorists have systematically infiltrated peaceful protests with the intention of escalating the situation and inciting riots.
A local gang leader came forward last week after being arrested during a night of mass-looting. The unnamed criminal is using his information to bargain for a reduced sentence.
 Allegedly, Holder’s goal behind pouring the proverbial gasoline on an already volatile scene is to test militarized police response in a martial law scenario. It is also suspected that the riots have been started as the latest in distractions from the diabolical duo of Obama and Holder. This isn’t the first time they have created a media bait-and-switch to cover up any of their numerous crimes and blunders.
 Officials have yet to publicly identify the damaging evidence submitted by the gang member, and are still in the process of verifying the legitimacy of said items. Judge Rineheart of the 22nd Circuit Court in St. Louis is presiding over the case, and has reviewed the materials. During a phone interview with National Report Judge Rineheart stated “The evidence I have seen is incredibly convincing.”
 Holder is not yet officially charged with a crime, but it’s expected that a warrant could be issued for him within the coming days. Obama’s spokespeople have declined to commen

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillarypanthers/	Hillary Clinton once supported Black Panthers on trial for murder	Truth!	['criminal justice', 'hillary clinton', 'liberal agenda', 'the clintons']			2015/03/17	"
Forgotten Facts
Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers decided that a fellow black panther named Alex Rackley needed to die. Rackley was suspected of disloyalty.
Rackley was first tied to a chair. Once safely immobilized, his “friends”  tortured him for hours by, among other things, pouring boiling water on him.
When they got tired of torturing Rackley, Black Panther member Warren Kimbo  took Rackley outside and put a bullet in his head. Rackley’s body was later found floating in a river about 25 miles north of New Haven, Conn.
Perhaps at this point you’re curious as to what happened to these Black Panthers.  In 1977, that’s only eight years later, only one of the killers was still in jail. The shooter, Warren Kimbro, managed to get a
scholarship to Harvard. He later became an assistant dean at Eastern Connecticut State College.
Isn’t that something? As a ’60s radical you can pump a bullet into someone’s head, and a few years later, in the same state, you can become an assistant college dean! Only in America!
Erica Huggins was the lady who served the Panthers by boiling the water for Mr. Rackley’s torture. Some years later Ms. Huggins was elected to a California School Board.
How in the world do you think these killers got off so easy? Maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who [incredibly] came to the defense of the Panthers. These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers during their trial.
One of these people was none other than Bill Lan Lee. Mr. Lee, or Mr. Lan Lee, as the case may be, isn’t a college dean. He isn’t a member of a California School Board. He is now head of the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
O.K., so who was the other Panther defender? Is this other notable Panther defender now a school board member? Is this other Panther apologist now an assistant college dean? No, Neither! The other Panther defender was, like Lee, a radical law student at Yale University at the time.
She is now known as The “smartest woman in the world.” She is none other  than the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from the state of New York—-our lovely First Lady, the incredible Hillary Rodham Clinton.
And now; as Paul Harvey says; you know (the rest of the story).
Pass this on! Especially to New Yorkers

She refused repeated  requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers. She is too busy meeting and supporting the mililtant prisoners in Puerto Rico. She wants our Navy out of the Caribbean.
Now — please don’t tell me you’re surprised. This woman wants to be president of the United States — and there is a huge percentage of  the voters who are anxious to help her achieve that dream.
If we fail to be vigilant, we may find that the same miracles which define our greatness, as a species; may one day spell our doom

https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-censored-obama-critics/	Facebook Censored Obama Critics	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Facebook Censors Navy SEALS to Protect Obama on Benghazi-Gate  



by AWR Hawkins 30 Oct 2012, 1:20 PM PDT Over the weekend, Facebook took down a message by the Special Operations Speaks PAC (SOS) which highlighted the fact that Obama denied backup to the forces being overrun in Benghazi. 
The message was contained in a meme which demonstrated how Obama had relied on the SEALS when he was ready to let them get Osama bin Laden, and how he had turned around and denied them when they called for backup on Sept 11. I spoke with Larry Ward, president of Political Media, Inc — the media company that handles SOS postings and media production. Ward was the one who personally put the Navy SEAL meme up, and the one who received the warning from Facebook and an eventual 24 hour suspension from Facebook because Ward put the meme back up after Facebook told him to take it down. Here’s what Ward told me: 
We created and posted this meme on Saturday after news broke that Obama had known and denied SEALS the backup they requested. Once the meme was up it garnered 30,000 shares, approx. 24,000 likes, and was read by hundreds of thousands of people — all within 24 hrs. On Sunday, I went into the SOS Facebook page to post something else and found a warning from Facebook that we had violated Facebook’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities with our meme. So I copied the warning, put it on the meme as as caption, and re-posted the meme to the Facebook page. 
Along with the re-posted meme, Ward put a link to the Facebook “feedback comment” inbox so visitors to the SOS page could send a message to Facebook if they were as outraged over the meme being jerked down as he was. 
Ward said Facebook pulled the re-posted meme down within 7 or 8 hours and suspended the SOS account for 24 hours. In other words, Facebook put the Navy SEALS in timeout in order to shield Obama. How low can you go?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-daughters-staffers-051512/	Obama’s Daughters Listed as Senior Staffers on Africa Trip	Disputed!				2015/03/17	"Daughters are paid staff !!!!!!!!!!! Now isn’t that just special?
THIS IS TRUE: CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF (SEE LINKS AT BOTTOM)
UNBELIEVABLE THIEVERY
Obama Daughters are Michelle’s ‘Senior Staffers’
Michelle was caught cheating on her expense report. What a show of arrogance!
This information was obtained by Judicial Watch March, 2012. The administration had to be sued to get this through the FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.
Michelle Obama listed daughters as ‘Senior Staffers’ to justify her expensive African vacation and safari.
October 5, 2011, Judicial Watch said the U.S. Air Force provided a C-32 ( a Boeing 757 ), modified by the military for the purpose of flying bigwigs around the world, to fly the First Lady and her entourage to and from Africa, at a cost of $424,142. Another $928.44 was listed as ‘bulk food’ costs per meal for the 192 on board. Lobster isn’t cheap when you fly it around the world.
The Obama daughters were listed on the manifest as senior staff. ‘This trip was as much an opportunity for the Obama family to go on a safari as it was a trip to conduct government business,’ said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. ‘This junket wasted tax dollars and the resources of our over-extended military. No wonder we had to sue to pry loose this information. ‘The nation is suffering with the economy sputtering, the national debt soaring and Obama’s economic rescue policies not only failing, but actively making things worse.
Meanwhile, the First Lady justifies an expensive trip to Africa to take a vacation and safari with her daughters by saying it’s ‘official business’ and even going so far as to list her children as staffers. The level of arrogance and dishonesty on display here is nothing short of shocking.’
It’s a true story. Check out these links and read it for yourself:

Folks, if the truth gets out, you will have to be the one to pass the info along to others. The major media outlets would NOT DARE say anything negative about the poster child for diversity and Marxism! Can you imagine what the liberal news media would say about a Republican pulling such a stunt? Out and out lying! God save the nation from this administration of the Obamanation!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-arpaio-investigation/	Phoenix Sheriff’s Investigation of the Long Form Birth Certificate of Barack Obama Concluded That PDF Copies Submitted May Have Been Forged	Truth!				2015/03/17	"“President Barack Obama’s long-form birth certificate released by the White House on April 27, 2011, is suspected to be a computer-generated forgery, not a scan of an original 1961 paper document as represented by the White House when the long-form birth certificate was made public,” Arizona’s Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said at a press conference today in Phoenix.
This is the major preliminary finding of a six-month ongoing Sheriff’s Cold Case Posse law enforcement investigation into the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate and his eligibility to be president.
Having developed probable cause to believe the long-form birth certificate was most likely a computer-generated forgery, investigators began examining other evidence of President Obama’s life history.
Investigators additionally have developed credible evidence suggesting:
• President Obama’s Selective Service card was most likely a forgery, revealed by an examination of the postal date stamp on the document;
• Records of Immigration and Naturalization Service cards filled out by airplane passengers arriving on international flights originating outside the United States in the month of August 1961, examined at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., are missing records for the week of President Obama’s birth, including the dates Aug. 1, 1961 through Aug. 7, 1961.
Beginning in October 2011, the Sheriff’s Cold Case Posse, consisting of former law enforcement officers and lawyers with law enforcement experience, examined dozens of witnesses and hundreds of documents, as well as taking numerous sworn statements from witnesses around the world.
In August 2011, 250 members of the Surprise, Arizona, Tea Party, residents of Maricopa County, presented a signed petition asking Sheriff Arpaio to undertake the investigation.
The Tea Party members petitioned under the premise that if a forged birth certificate was utilized to obtain a position for Barack Obama on the 2012 Arizona presidential ballot, their rights as Maricopa County voters could be compromised.
The Cold Case investigators further determined that the Hawaii Department of Health has engaged in what Sheriff’s investigators believe is a systematic effort to hide from public inspection whatever original 1961 birth records the Hawaii Department of Health may have in their possession.
“Officers of the Hawaii Department of Health and various elected Hawaiian public officials may have intentionally obscured 1961 birth records and procedures, to avoid having to release to public inspection and to the examination of court-authorized forensic examiners any original Obama 1961 birth records the Hawaii Department of Health may or may not have,” said Mike Zullo, the lead investigator in Sheriff Arpaio’s Cold Case Posse.
The Cold Case investigators have not yet determined who, when, or precisely how the long-form computer-generated birth certificate released on April 27 may have been forged, but investigators say the evidence contained in the computer-generated PDF file released by the White House as well as important deficiencies in the Hawaii process of certifying the long-form birth certificate establish probable cause that a forgery has been committed.
The Cold Case Posse investigators advised Sheriff Arpaio that the forgers most likely committed two crimes: first, in fraudulently creating a forgery that the White House characterized, knowingly or unknowingly, as an officially produced governmental birth record; and second, in fraudulently presenting to the residents of Maricopa County and to the American public at large a forgery the White House represented as “proof positive” of President Obama’s authentic 1961 Hawaii long-form birth certificate.
“A continuing investigation is needed to identify the identity of the person or persons involved in creating the alleged birth certificate forgery, and to determine who, if anyone, in the White House or the state of Hawaii may have authorized the forgery,” Arpaio said.
Among the evidence released at the press conference were five videos the Cold Case Posse produced to demonstrate why the Obama long-form birth certificate is suspected to be a computer-generated forgery.
The videos consisted of step-by-step computer demonstrations using a control document.
The videos were designed to display the testing used by the investigators to examine various claims made by supporters of the April 27 document.
The videos illustrate point-by-point the investigators’ conclusion that the features and anomalies observed on the Obama long-form birth certificate were inconsistent with features produced when a paper document is scanned, even if the scan of the paper document had been enhanced by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and optimized.
Additionally, the videos demonstrated that the Hawaii Department of Health Registrar’s name stamp and the Registrar’s date stamp were computer-generated images imported into an electronic document, as opposed to actual rubber stamp imprints inked by hand or machine onto a paper document.
“That we were able to cast reasonable suspicions on the authenticity of the Registrar stamps was especially disturbing, since these stamp imprints are designed to provide government authentication to the document itself,” Zullo said, stressing that if the Registrar stamps are forgeries, the document itself is likely a forgery.
The investigators also chronicled a series of inconsistent and misleading representations that various Hawaii government officials have made over the past five years regarding what, if any, original birth records are held by the Hawaii Department of Health.
“As I said at the beginning of the investigation,” Arpaio said, “the president can put all this to rest quite easily. All he has to do is demand the Hawaii Department of Health release to the American public and to a panel of certified court-authorized forensic examiners all original 1961 paper, microfilm, and computer birth records the Hawaii Department of Health has in its possession.”
Arpaio further stressed the Hawaii Department of Health needs to provide, as part of the full disclosure, evidence regarding the chain of custody of all Obama birth records, including paper, microfilm, and electronic records, in order to eliminate the possibility that a forger or forgers may have tampered with the birth records.
Arpaio went on to say the President should also authorize Kapiolani Hospital, the birth hospital listed on the Obama long-form birth certificate, to release any and all hospital patient records for Stanley Ann Dunham Obama, his mother, and for the newly born Barack Obama, in order to provide additional corroboration for the original 1961 birth records held in the Hawaii Department of Health vault.
“Absent the authentic Hawaii Department of Health 1961 birth records for Barack Obama, there is no other credible proof supporting the idea or belief that President Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, as he and the White House have consistently asserted,” Zullo said.
“In fact, absent the authentication of Hawaii Department of Health 1961 birth records for Barack Obama, there is no other proof he was born anywhere within the United States.”
Arpaio concluded the press conference by suggesting a congressional investigation might be warranted and asked that any other law enforcement agency with information referencing this investigation be forwarded to his office.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-muslim-appreciation-day-092813/	President Obama Declared November National Muslim Appreciation Month	Fiction!  & Satire!				2015/03/17	"




Washington, DC — President Barack Obama held a press conference to announce that he is declaring the month of November ‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’.
“The Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect,” Obama told reporters. “We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So from now on, November will be a month to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the Quran.”
Khaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood‘s Freedom and Justice Party told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions. “I spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community,” Matei said. “This is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.”
Obama informed reporters about his future plans for helping Muslims around the world. “I will be working with Congress in making it easier for Muslims to earn a Green Card and achieve American citizenship,” Obama said. “Currently as it stands, obtaining a Visa or Green Card for a Muslim is very difficult. There are too many background checks in place and I plan to fix that.” Obama continued, “Muslims are hardworking people who are just looking to live the American Dream like the rest of us. Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us.”
Obama finished the press conference by explaining to reporters how happy he is with America. “Folks, there is no way we could have had a ‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’ 20 years ago. That really says a lot about the growth and progress of this great country.”
‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’ begins November 1st and will end at midnight on November 30th. For any questions or comments please contact the 24-hour National Muslim Appreciation Hotline at (785) 273-0325.

Only Three Times…
The occasions were:
1. Barack Obama 2010
2. Barack Obama 2011
3. Barack Obama 2012
For the past 68 years, every single president, except Obama, has paid tribute to the fallen American soldiers killed on D-Day.
This year, instead of honoring the soldiers, he made a 3,000 mile campaign trip on Air Force 1 to California to raise funds for the upcoming election.
Priorities? – – It speaks volumes… doesn’t it?
Please remember this when you go to vote in November. One of those candidates for President doesn’t care about those who sacrificed for world peace.

Obama to College Students: Do Not Celebrate Fourth of July
July 2, 2013
As the country prepares to celebrate its independence from Great Britain President Obama had a completely different message for a group of Congressional Summer interns in Washington:
Obama Speaks to Congressional Summer Interns
“America is a great country. There is no denying this. However, I caution you all as you step forward in your careers. Peer back into history and ask yourselves- Was a revolution truly necessary? Great Britain may not have had it completely right, but they had many things right. Take taxes for example. If your neighbor makes $1 Million a year, but you and your family can barely keep the heat on should he not help your family? God instructs us to help our neighbors. He does not instruct us to look down upon them though the windows of capitalism. Why then on the Fourth of July should you celebrate such a radical break from what is Godly and just? No doubt there are many voices warning you of the harm of big government. They are wrong. Government can provide you with what family and friends cannot. If this is gone what will you have?”
Many in the crowd seemed uneasy, and desperate for some sort of clarification. Julie Barks, an intern from Louisiana State University, asked President Obama, “Are you saying we should not celebrate the birth of our country?”
President Obama responded, ”I believe we should celebrate where we are going. Celebrate moving forward. Not where we have been.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxes-election/	Obama’s Tax Proposals	Mostly Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Spread the word…..
This is something you should be aware of so you don’t get blind-sided.  This is really going to catch a lot of families off guard. It should
make you worry.
Proposed changes in taxes after 2008 General election:
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
MCCAIN
0% on home sales up to $500,000 per home (couples) McCain does not propose any change in existing home sales income tax.
OBAMA
28% on profit from ALL home sales
How does this affect you?
If you sell your home and make a profit, you will pay 28% of your gain on taxes.
If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes. This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income.
DIVIDEND TAX
MCCAIN 15% (no change)
OBAMA 39.6%
How will this affect you?
If you have any money invested in stock market, IRA, mutual funds, college funds, life insurance, retirement accounts, or anything that pays or reinvests dividends, you will now be paying nearly 40% of the money earned on taxes if Obama become president.
The experts predict that ‘higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market yetdo absolutely nothing to cut the deficit.
INCOME TAX
MCCAIN (no changes)
Single making 30K – tax $4,500
Single making 50K – tax $12,500
Single making 75K – tax $18,750
Married making 60K- tax $9,000
Married making 75K – tax $18,750
Married making 125K – tax $31,250
OBAMA
(reversion to pre-Bush tax cuts)
Single making 30K – tax $8,400
Single making 50K – tax $14,000
Single making 75K – tax $23,250
Married making 60K – tax $16,800
Married making 75K – tax $21,000
Married making 125K – tax $38,750
Under Obama your taxes will more than double!
How does this affect you?
No explanation needed. This is pretty straight for ward.
INHERITANCE TAX
MCCAIN 0% (No change, Bush repealed this tax)
OBAMA Restore the inheritance tax
How does this affect you?
Many families have lost businesses, farms and ranches, and homes that have been in their families for generations because they could not afford the inheritance tax.  Those willing their assets to loved ones will not only lose them to these taxes.
NEW TAXES BEING PROPOSED BY OBAMA
* New government taxes proposed on homes that are more than 2400 square feet.
* New gasoline taxes (as if gas weren’t high enough already)
* New taxes on natural resources consumption (heating gas, water, electricity)
* New taxes on retirement accounts and last but not least….
* New taxes to pay f or socialized medicine so we can receive the same level of medical care as other third-world countries!!!

Not True	['imaginary bans', 'imaginary muslim outrage', 'muslims', 'muslims demand', 'not a ban', 'outrage bait', 'subway', 'the conservative rebel']			2015/03/17	"Subway Pulls Pork!


Popular fast-food chain Subway has decided to remove ham and bacon from the menus of nearly 200 of its locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, replacing it with halal meat, according to the Daily Mail.


An “all meats are halal” sign now appears at Subway locations where these changes have been adopted, with turkey ham serving as a replacement, the Daily Mail reported.
Muslims cannot eat pork or consume any non-halal meat — meat that is not slaughtered and prepared in accordance with Islamic law.




A Subway spokeswoman confirmed to TheBlaze Wednesday that the company has responded over the past few years to an increasingly diverse population by providing halal meats, but declined to comment directly on whether ham and bacon have been removed from the menu at select locations.
“Due to the growing popularity of the Subway chain, with the diverse multicultural population across the U.K. and Ireland, we put a program in place in 2007 to ensure that the population demographic is taken into account when new store openings are considered in order that we meet consumer demand in each location,” the spokeswoman said in a statement.
“All our suppliers comply with EU animal welfare legislation as a minimum and we require suppliers of halal products to adopt the stunning of animals prior to their slaughter. All halal meats are certified by the appropriate halal authorities,” the statement said.
The spokeswoman declined to address whether certain stores display “all meats are halal” signs, saying only that there are signs at select locations letting customers know that meats sold within comply with Islamic standards.
“All halal Subway stores have numerous signs stating that they serve halal food,” she said. “These are situated on the menu panels, nutritional information and in the front window of the store.”
Pressed further about reports that ham and bacon have been removed completely from menus at 185 locations, the spokeswoman did not answer directly.
“It is factually correct to say that the Subway brand have approximately 185 stores that serve halal food in the UK and Ireland,” she said.

Bastards…. Anyone tired of the b.s. yet? ANYONE who has spent ANY time in the Middle East KNOWS that nation building there is a waste of hope, blood and treasure. They will take your money and support with a smile and then knife you in the back when you turn around. Its been this way for CENTURIES.
When will we stand up and do something about this…
The attack was planned long before the date of 9/11. Even our own administration wants to blame it on the stupid video…
If this doesn’t make more Americans mad as hell, we’re sunk. We know how Obama has handled it… embarrassing for sure
These are pictures you will not see in the Obama media. Our US Ambassador to Libya being dragged through the streets before being murdered. Here is our American Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, diplomat, father, husband, and American Citizen, being dragged through the streets of Benghazi , and your President does NOTHING! . . . except go to Las Vegas for a fund raiser, plus two more today.
To most Americans this is an act of war. To our president it’s just another act of office violence like Fort Hood . He and the Secy of State have already apologized and will soon send them another $6.3 Billion in foreign aid. This is as sad as it gets.
 Other version:

Please, please read.
Fortunately in the world of modern communication, the real truth can ultimately be brought to light. Sad…………………..
THIS IS A TRUE STORY…and a dirty one!
Cynthia Lee Meyers –
You need to read this true account of what happened to our Ambassador Stevens and the other 3 who died. If this doesn’t make you mad……………
Cynthia Lee Myers Wanted to share the truth of what happened over in Libya, you will not find this in the media yet but it aired on FNC…..please read….
“Here is my story. A week out the Embassy in Tripoli began receiving multiple tips about an Al Queda cell in the area planning an attack on 9/11 in response to the killing of Bin Laden. For the next several days, the state dept. and WH were asked for a security force and were denied at least six times. Ambassador Stevens and his team were given the all clear that the Consulate in Benghazi was safe and there was no need for a security force other than his three personal guards (one being my cousin) and a few Libyans who were not armed.
Then the attack and murders occurred. Immediately the WH claimed it was a protest gone bad over a you tube video. Obama made a quick speech in the Rose Garden on Sept. 12 before catching a plane to Vegas to campaign. He made a generic statement at the end of his speech after placing the blame on an overheated protest over the video. He said “No act of terror will shake the resolve of America. Later that day and over the next 2 days, the liberal media began saying Ambassador Stevens and the other three men died. of smoke inhalation. This was not the case.
Out of respect for my cousin, I’m not going to be specific about his murder. However Ambassador Stevens was brutally murdered. His genitals were cut off, he was sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned. He was drug thru the streets and left for dead.
This is an eyewitness testimony of a local Dr. who found the Ambassador in a ditch and tried to save his life. He had no idea who he was. The other three men, including my cousin, met similar fates. And deaths due to smoke inhalation is a 100% fabricated LIE.
The next week I drove my aunt and Uncle and 2 others to DC to receive his body. We met with Hillary, Panetta, and Susan Rice. ALL of whom apologized and said it was a protest gone bad over a video and exited the area. Next Obama entered with the same story and didn’t apologize and wasn’t sympathetic. My aunt cried to this man and all he did was hand her flowers and walk away. I tried to get his attention, but didn’t. I got upset and yelled liar to him, he kept walking. Then a secret service agent grabbed my arm and led me to a room where I was held till the proceedings were over.
America, I saw firsthand how cold this man is. What kind of liar he is. Most of you haven’t a clue about this tyrant and yet you support him. And act like every word he says is Gospel. These murders and the fast and furious cover ups make water-gate look like, a kid who told his bff’s secret to the class.
THIS PART YOU DON’T KNOW, BUT SHOULD.
AMERICAN VALOR, BENGHAZI, LIBYA:
The stunning part of this story is that Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty killed 60 of the attacking force. Once the compound was overrun, the attackers were incensed to discover that just two men had inflicted so much death and destruction.
The news has been full of the attacks on our embassies throughout the Muslim world, and in particular, the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others in Benghazi, Libya. However, there’s a little known story of incredible bravery, heroics, and courage that should be the top story.
So what actually happened at the U.S. embassy in Libya? We are learning more about this every day. Ambassador Stevens and Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, along with administrative staff, were working out of temporary quarters due to the fact that in the spring of 2011 during the so-called Arab Spring, the United States cut ties with then president Moammar Gadhafi.
Our embassy was looted and ransacked, causing it to be unusable. It is still in a state of disrepair. Security for embassies and their personnel is to be provided by the host nation. Since Libya has gone through a civil war of sorts in the past 18 months, the current government is very unstable, and therefore, unreliable.
A well-organized attack by radical Muslims was planned specifically targeting the temporary U.S. embassy building. The Libyan security force that was in place to protect our people deserted their post, or joined the attacking force. Either way, our people were in a real fix. And it should be noted that Ambassador Stevens had mentioned on more than one occasion to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, that he was quite concerned for his personal safety and the welfare of his people. It is thought that Ambassador Stevens was on a “hit list”.
A short distance from the American compound, two Americans were sleeping. They were in Libya as independent contractors working an assignment totally unrelated to our embassy. They also happened to be former Navy Seals.
When they heard the noise coming from the attack on our embassy, as you would expect from highly trained warriors, they ran to the fight. Apparently, they had no weapons, but seeing the Libyan guards dropping their guns in their haste in fleeing the scene, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty snatched up several of these discarded weapons and prepared to defend the American compound.
Not knowing exactly what was taking place, the two Seals set up a defensive perimeter. Unfortunately Ambassador Stevens was already gravely injured, and Foreign Service officer, Sean Smith, was dead. However, due to their quick action and suppressive fire, twenty administrative personnel in the embassy were able to escape to safety.
Eventually, these two courageous men were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers brought against them, an enemy force numbering between 100 to 200 attackers which came in two waves. But the stunning part of the story is that Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty killed 60 of the attacking force. Once the compound was overrun, the attackers were incensed to discover that just two men had inflicted so much death and destruction.
As it became apparent to these selfless heroes, they were definitely going to lose their lives unless some reinforcements showed up in a hurry. As we know now, that was not to be. I’m fairly certain they knew they were going to die in this gun fight, but not before they took a whole lot of bad guys with them!
Consider these tenets of the Navy SEAL Code:
1) Loyalty to Country, Team and Teammate,
2) Serve with Honor and Integrity On and Off the Battlefield,
3) Ready to Lead, Ready to Follow, Never Quit,
4) Take responsibility for your actions and the actions of your teammates,
5) Excel as Warriors through Discipline and Innovation,
6) Train for War, Fight to Win, Defeat our Nation’s Enemies, and…
7) Earn your Trident every day.
http://www.navyseals.com/seal-code-warrior-creed
Thank you, Tyrone and Glen. To the very last breath, you both lived up to the SEAL Code. You served all of us well. You were courageous in the face of certain death.
And Tyrone, even though you never got to hold your newborn son, he will grow up knowing the character and quality of his father, a man among men who sacrificed
himself defending others.

modifying family history
It’s all in the way you present it:
Hillary, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her great-great uncle, Remus Rodham, a fellow lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889.
The only known photograph of Remus shows him standing on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
“Remus Rodham; horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.”
In Hillary’s Family History, her staff of professional image consultants, cropped Remus’s picture, scanned it in as an enlarged image, and edited with image processing software so that all that’s seen is a head shot. The accompanying biographical sketch is as follows:
“Remus Rodham was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.”

President Franklin D. Roosevelt was to give his Day of Infamy speech to Congress on Tuesday, and although the trip from the White House to Capitol Hill was short, agents were not sure how to transport him safely. At the time, Federal Law prohibited buying any cars that cost more than $750, so they would have to get clearance from Congress to do that, and nobody had time for that.


One of the Secret Service members, however, discovered that the US Treasury had seized the bulletproof car that mobster Al Capone owned when he was sent to jail in 1931. They cleaned it, made sure it was running fine and had it ready for the President the day after.


And run properly it did. Capone’s car was a sight to behold. It had been painted black and green so as to look identical to Chicago’s police cars at the time. It also had a specially installed siren and flashing lights hidden behind the grille, along with a police scanner radio.


To top it off, the gangsters 1928 Cadillac 341A Town Sedan had 3,000 pounds of armor and inch-thick bulletproof windows. Mechanics are said to have cleaned and checked each feature of the Caddy well into the night of December 7th to make sure that it would run properly the next day for the Commander in Chief.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/romney-nyc-missing-teen/	Mitt Romney Set Up A Command Center To Help Find Partner’s Missing Daughter	Truth! 				2015/03/17	"On Romney’s character….


In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared. She had attended a rave party in New York City and had become high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Mitt Romney closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay’s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York, and asked them to help find his friend’s missing daughter. Romney’s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured areas of New York City on foot and talked with everyone they could – prostitutes, drug addicts – anyone.


That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in a stranger’s basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney’s former partner credits him with saving his daughter’s life, saying, “I’ll never forget this.”


So, here’s an epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can’t help himself. He sees a problem, and sets to work solving it. He doesn’t do it for self-aggrandizement or for personal gain – he does it because that’s just how he’s wired.


Many people are unaware of the fact that when Romney was asked by his old employer, Bill Bain, to come back to Bain & Company as CEO to rescue the firm from bankruptcy, Romney left Bain Capital to work at Bain & Company for an annual salary of one dollar.


When Romney went to the rescue of the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, he accepted no salary for three years, and wouldn’t use an expense account.


He also accepted no salary as Governor of Massachusetts.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pelosi/	Nancy Pelosi on Taxing the Rich	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
IF YOU DO NOTHING ELSE…READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH!!
 
 Insanity Personified : Nancy Pelosi
 Nancy Pelosi condemned the new record highs of the stock market as “just   another example of Bush policies helping the rich get richer”. “First Bush cut taxes for the rich and the economy has rebounded with new record low unemployment rates, which only means wealthy employers are getting even wealthier at the expense of the underpaid working class”.
 She went on to say “Despite the billions of dollars being spent in Iraqour economy is still strong and government tax revenues are at all time highs. What this really means is that business is exploiting the war effort and working Americans, just to put money in their own pockets”. 
 When questioned about recent stock market highs she responded “Only the rich benefit from these record highs. Working Americans, welfare recipients, the unemployed and minorities are not sharing in these obscene record highs”.
 “There is no question these windfall profits and income created by theBush administration need to be taxed at 100% rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class”. “Profits from the stock market do not reward the hard work of our working class who, by their hard work, are responsible for generating these corporate profits that create stock market   profits for the rich We in congress will need to address this issue to either tax these profits or to control the stock market to prevent this unearned income to flow to the rich.”
 When asked about the fact that over 80% of all Americans have investments in mutual funds, retirement funds, 401K’s, and the stock market she replied “That may be true, but probably only 5% account for 90% of all these investment dollars. That’s just more “trickle down” economics claiming that if a corporation is successful that everyone from the CEO to the floor sweeper benefit from higher wages and job security which is ridiculous” “How much of this ‘trickle down’ ever get to the unemployed and minorities in our   county? None, and that’s the tragedy of these stock market highs.”
 “We democrats are going to address this issue after the election when we take control of the congress. We will return to the 60% to 80% tax rates on the rich and we will be able to take at least 30% of all current lower Federal Income Tax tax payers off the roles and increase government income substantially. We need to work toward the goal of equalizing income in our country and at the same time limiting the amount the rich can invest.”
 When asked how these new tax dollars would be spent, she replied “We need to raise the standard of living of our poor, unemployed and minorities. For example, we have an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in our country who need our help along with millions of unemployed minorities.  Stock market windfall profits taxes could go a long ways to guarantee these people the standard of living they would like to have as ‘Americans.’ ” 
   Send it on to your intelligent friends. I just did!!
 
 This is an insult to the people she supposedly represents!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-dream-act-executive-order/	President Obama  Enacted the Dream Act by Executive Order	 Truth! & Fiction! 				2015/03/17	"Check out what happened on Friday (6-24-2011)
Dream Act: Obama passes amnesty by executive order
Written by Gil Guign at Border & Immigration Breaking News Featured June 23, 2011
Arizona
Last Friday with no fan fare no press coverage and with every effort made to hide his actions from the American people, President Obama, enacted the DREAM Act by executive order.
Opposed by a majority of the American people and twice defeated in Congress the DREAM Act grants amnesty to any illegal alien residing in the United States if she/he agrees to enlist in the U.S. Military or enter college.
The Obama administration memo from the John Morton Director of I.C.E. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) directs I.C.E. Agents now to use prosecutorial discretion with regard to enforcing immigration laws.
Director Morton says that Obama Administration policy directs border patrol agents not to enforce immigration laws: When ICE favorably exercises prosecutorial discretion it essentially decides not to assert the full scope of the enforcement authority available to the agency.
You read that right.
According to the Obama administration, favorable enforcement means NOT enforcing the law!
According to one of the first press reports to break this important story the new Obama policy is cut and dry: federal immigration officials do not have to deport illegal aliens if they are enrolled in any type of education program if their family members have volunteered for U.S. Military service or even if they are pregnant or nursing.
Arizona and the voter ID law
Just recently Obama’s Department of Justice (DOJ) blocked Arizona from enforcing its voter ID law. Arizona is one if not the biggest portal of illegal immigration in the nation with half a million illegal aliens coming through the sate annually. Arizona’s Attorney General Tom Horne recently stated that he believed that blocking of the law facilitated massive voter fraud by illegal aliens.
Attorney General Tom Horne accused the Obama administration Tuesday of trying to thwart Arizona’s voter-ID laws in a bid to get more illegal immigrants to the polls presumably to cast ballots for the president and Democrats.
Horne acknowledged that a brief filed by the Department of Justice in a case to be heard next month by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals centers around the agency’s argument that Arizona’s law requiring proof of citizenship to register is preempted by federal law. But Horne, a Republican, told Capitol Media Services he sees something more sinister.
The 2012 presidential elections
First we have amnesty passed by executive order, then we have President Obama’s DOJ blocking voter ID in Arizona . What could possibly be the president’s motive?
This story has the potential to bring the Obama Administration to its knees. The momentum can be on our side and just e-mailing it to others can create a critical mass. Don’t assume you have no power. You do!
If you are in favor of this, then by all means, delete this message.
If you are not, then pass this along to help everyone realize just how much is at stake, knowing that apathy is the greatest danger to our freedom.
This is truly scary! Of course we are not a democracy, we are a Constitutional Republic . Someone should point this out to Obama. Of course we know he and too many others pay little attention to The Constitution. There couldn’t be more at stake than in Nov 2012. If you are as concerned as I am, please pass this along.
as far as I can check this appears to be true.
Some comments about allowing the ones in the military to be citizens makes me wonder HOW they were allowed to join in the first place. Was their ID so good that it passed without the government finding out they were illegal?

It will take you less than a minute to read this. If you agree, please pass it on.
It’s an idea whose time has come to deal with this self-serving situation:
Children of Congress members do not have to pay back their college student loans.
Staffers of Congress family members are also exempt from having to pay back student loans.
Members of Congress have exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, under which ordinary citizens must live.
And as the latest example, they have exempted themselves from Healthcare Reform, in all of its aspects.
We must not tolerate an elite class of such people, elected as public servants and then putting themselves above the law.
I truly don’t care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent, or whatever.
The self-serving must stop.
Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon their states.
It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention.
IF…
Each person that receives this will forward it on to 20 people, in three days most people in The United States of America will have the message.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/congressionalpensions/	Members of Congress do not have to participate in Social Security.	Not True	['chain emails', 'congress', 'pensions', 'Politics', 'retirement']			2015/03/17	"So that any who don’t, may know.
Our Senators and Congressmen don’t pay in to Social Security, and, of course, they don’t collect from it.
The reason is that they have a special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago. For all practical purposes, it works like this:
When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die, except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living adjustments.
For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be expected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs. Bradley drawing $275,000 during the last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span for each.
This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or Congressman.
This fine retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we who pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.
Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so desirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could increase their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that works so well, that Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who aren’t in it, would clamor to get in.
That is how good Social Security could be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen, and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast they fix it.
If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them along the way, might be able to help. How many can YOU send it to?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/billofnorights-ht/	The “Bill of No Rights” From Georgia Representative Mitchell Kaye	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Subject: rights,
The following was written by State Representative Mitchell Kaye from GA.
This guy should have run for President:
“We, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and secure the blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guiltridden, delusional, and other, bed-wetters.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights”.
ARTICLE I:
You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.
ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone – not just you! You may leave the room, turn channel, express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.
ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.
ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes.
ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we’re just not interested in public health care.
ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentio don’t be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair.
ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don’t be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won’t have the right to a big screen color TV or a life of leisure.
ARTICLE VIII: You don’t have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won’t lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if you’d like. However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.
ARTICLE IX: You don’t have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful.
ARTICLE X: You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness – which by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.”
If you agree, share this with a friend.
No, you don’t have to, and nothing tragic will befall you if you don’t.
I just think it is about  time common sense is allowed to flourish -call it the age of reason revisited.

Subject: John Kerry: an opinion
Another view of John Kerry and his post-Vietnam activities
http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/0104/29garlock.html
An excerpt of Garlock’s editorial which can be read in its entirety at the
web page above.
A young Kerry, however, broke faith with his brothers when he returned to
the United States. With the financial aid of Jane Fonda, he led highly
visible protests against the war. He wrote a book that many considered to
be pro-Hanoi, titled “The New Soldier.”
The cover photo of his book depicted veterans in a mismatch of military
uniforms mocking the legendary image of Marines raising the American flag
atop Mount Suribachi in the 1945 battle for Iwo Jima, holding the American
flag upside down.
Kerry publicly supported Hanoi’s position to use our POWs as a bargaining
chip in negotiations for a peace agreement.
Kerry threw what appeared to be his medals over a fence in front of the
Capitol building in protest, on camera of course, but was caught in his
lie
years later when his medals turned up displayed on his office wall.
Many good and decent people opposed the Vietnam War. Many of us who fought
it hated it, too. I know I did.
But like Fonda’s infamous visit to Hanoi in 1972, Kerry’s public actions
encouraged our enemy at a time they were killing America’s sons. Decades
after the war was done, interviews with our former enemy’s leaders
confirmed that public protests in the United States, like Kerry’s, played
a
significant role in their strategy.
Many of us wonder which of our brothers who died young would be alive
today
had people like Fonda and Kerry objected to the war in a more suitable

https://www.truthorfiction.com/anwar/	Forwarded Email about the Drilling for Oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge	Truth! & Disputed!				2015/03/17	" 
FIRST-do you know what ANWR is?
ANWR=Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Now–A comparison.

And some perspective.

NOTE WHERE THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AREA IS.
(It’s in the ANWR Coastal Plain)

THIS IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS, LIBERALS AND “GREENS” SHOW YOU WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT ANWR
And they are right.  These ARE photographs of ANWR.



ISN’T ANWR BEAUTIFUL? WHY SHOULD WE DRILL HERE (AND DESTROY) THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE?
WELL, THAT’S NOT EXACTLY
The Truth:
Do you remember the map?
The map showed that the proposed drilling area is in the ANWR Coastal Plain.
Do those photographs look like a coastal plain to you?
WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE.
THAT IS NOT WHERE THEY ARE WANTING TO DRILL!
THIS IS WHAT THE PROPOSED EXPLORATION AREA ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IN THE WINTER

AND THIS IS WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IN THE SUMMER



HERE ARE A COUPLE SCREENSHOTS FROM GOOGLE EARTH


AS YOU CAN SEE, THE AREA WHERE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT DRILLING IS A BARREN WASTELAND.
OH, AND THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT ON THE LOCAL WILDLIFE.
HERE IS A PHOTO (SHOT DURING THE SUMMER) OF THE
“DEPLETED WILDLIFE” SITUATION CREATED BY DRILLING AROUND PRUDHOE BAY.
DON’T YOU THINK THAT THE CARIBOU REALLY HATE THAT DRILLING?

HERE’S THAT SAME SPOT DURING THE WINTER.

HEY, THIS BEAR SEEMS TO REALLY “HATE” THE PIPELINE NEAR PRUDHOE BAY.

*The Prudhoe Bay area accounts for17% of U.S. domestic oil production
NOW, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE LYING ABOUT ANWR?
REMEMBER WHEN AL GORE SAID THAT
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK TO “ARTIFICIALLY” RAISE GAS PRICES
TO $5.00 A GALLON?
WELL
AL GORE AND HIS FELLOW DEMOCRATS HAVE ALMOST REACHED THEIR GOAL!
NOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN LYING,
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
YOU CAN START BY FORWARDING THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW
SO THAT THEY WILL KNOW THE TRUTH.

Obama’s Brother Joins Hamas?
 

In case you’ve wondered why Barack Obama has abandoned Israel and seems to be siding with Hamas in the current conflict, wonder no more.
A year ago I wrote about Obama’s older half-brother Malik Obama:
“In addition to illegally operating the non-profit organization, Barack H. Obama Foundation, Malik Obama currently works as the Executive Secretary of the Islamic Da’wa Organization (IDO). The US State Department considers the government of Sudan to be a terrorist organization and it just so happens that the IDO was created by that same Sudanese government.”
“In 2010, the IDO held a conference in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. The conference was led by Omar Al-Bashir, the President of Sudan. He is wanted on seven counts of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The US State Department has also listed Bashir as the head of the state sponsored terrorism of Sudan.”…
“Malik Obama not only attended the IDO conference, but he spoke at it as well. There are photos of Malik and his boss, Suar Al Dahab, Chairman of the IDO. Dahab has a close relationship with Bashir and has been seen with Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who says Hitler did not finish the job in exterminating the Jews, and Ismail Haniyeh, the Prime Minister of Hamas (a terrorist organization). On a recent trip to Gaza, the three men appeared together and it was obvious that Dahab demonstrated full support to the two leaders.”
“With Malik’s obvious ties to Islamic terrorism, I can’t help but wonder just how close the two half-brothers are. According to reports, they each stood as best man at the other’s wedding, although I’m not sure which wedding of Malik’s it’s referring to since he supposedly has 13 wives. Malik has also visited the White House on a number of occasions.”
At that time, I questioned the loyalty of Barack Obama to America and our ally Israel.
Now, former Muslim extremist Walid Shoebat and his colleague Ben Barrack report that Malik Obama also attended the 2010 Orphans Development Fund (ODF) Conference in which he wore a Hamas scarf that bore the Palestinian inscriptions:
“Jerusalem is ours – WE ARE COMING”
The scarf also contained a map of Palestine with the inscription:
“From the River to the Sea!”
This is a common Palestinian statement meaning that there is no Israel and Malik has worn it at more than one public event so it isn’t just a one-time fluke. Shoebat says there can be no doubt that Malik Obama has definitely sided with Hamas and shares their vow to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.
Malik is not just a distant half-brother of Barack Obama. He was the best man at Barack and Michelle’s wedding and has been a frequent visitor to the White House. When asked about being Barack’s half-brother in an interview for GQ Magazine, Malik took offense:
“‘Everyone’s referring to us as half, quarter,…step, things like that,’ he says, displeased even by the taste of those words. ‘I think that’s like weights and measures. This didn’t even occur to us until he became president, until he gained prominence. And now we’re sort of like celebrities.’”
“‘But this is a streak of ignorance,’ he adds. ‘Here in Africa we don’t think of each other as ‘half’ this or that. In an extended family, someone is your brother even if he is just in your clan. So I…am Obama.’”
This should lay to rest why Barack Obama has spent 5 ½ years destroying America’s relationship with Israel and at the same time has been courting all of the Islamic nations that have vowed to destroy Israel.
Hamas clearly started the current conflict by kidnapping and killing three Israeli teenage boys. After Israel retaliated, Hamas began rocketing Israel which is what prompted Israel to start rocketing Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. Hamas and the Palestinian extremists clearly started the conflict yet Barack Obama has joined the anti-Israeli liberal media in condemning Israel for what’s happening.
With a brother who’s working with, for and supporting anti-Semitic and anti-American terrorists, it explains why Obama has been so dead set on destroying Israel and the United States.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-harry-truman-defined-political-correctness-in-telegraph/	President Harry Truman Defined Political Correctness in Telegraph	Fiction!	['Trending Rumors']			2015/04/02	"FINALLY, A DEFINITION OF THE TERM “POLITICAL CORRECTNESS!
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS… Defined.
For the last six odd years, almost all of the things I wanted to write or say, have been stymied by a recently coined term referred to as “POLITICAL CORRECTNESS”! Although I consider myself rather fluent in the English language, that term was not in my vocabulary. My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to do a little research and after two weeks of chasing fruitless leads, I found what I’d been looking for at the Truman Library and Museum in Independence Missouri. A unnamed source there sent me copies of four telegrams that were between Harry Truman and Douglas MacArthur on the day before the actual signing of the Surrender Agreement. The contents of those four telegrams below are exactly as received, not a word has been added or deleted!
(1) Tokyo,Japan
0800-September 1,1945
To: President Harry S Truman
From: General D A MacArthur
Tomorrow we meet with those yellow bellied bastards and sign the Surrender Documents, any last minute instructions!
(2) Washington, D C
1300-September 1, 1945
To: D A MacArthur
From: H S Truman
Congratulations, job well done, but you must tone down your obvious
dislike of the Japanese when discussing the terms of the surrender with the press, because some of your remarks are fundamentally not politically
correct!
(3) Tokyo, Japan
1630-September 1, 1945
To: H S Truman
From: D A MacArthur and C H Nimitz
Wilco Sir, but both Chester and I are somewhat confused, exactly what does the term politically correct mean?
(4) Washington, D C
2120-September 1, 1945
To: D A MacArthur/C H Nimitz
From: H S Truman
Political Correctness is a doctrine, recently fostered by a delusional, illogical minority and promoted by a sick mainstream media, which holds forth the proposition that it is entirely possible to pick up a piece of sh*t by clean end!
Now, with special thanks to my friends at the Truman Museum and Harry, you and I finally have a full understanding of what “POLITICAL CORRECTNESS” really means!—Allan—

https://www.truthorfiction.com/womens-vote/	Women’s Suffrage Movement, Why Women Should Vote and the “Iron Jawed Angels”	Truth!				2015/03/30	" Subject: for women voters   This is the story of our Grandmothers, and Great-grandmothers, as they lived only 90 years ago.  It was not until 1920 that women were granted the right to go to the polls and vote.   The women who made it so were innocent and defenseless. And by the end of the night, they were barely alive. Forty prison guards wielding clubs and their warden’s blessing went on a rampage against the 33 women wrongly convicted of ‘obstructing sidewalk traffic.’   They beat Lucy Burn, chained her hands to the cell bars above her head and left her hanging for the night, bleeding and gasping for air.  They hurled Dora Lewis into a dark cell, smashed her head against an iron bed and knocked her out cold. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, thought Lewis was dead and suffered a heart attack. Additional affidavits describe the guards grabbing, dragging, beating, choking, slamming, pinching, twisting and kicking the women.   Thus unfolded the ‘Night of Terror’ on Nov. 15, 1917, when the warden  at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia ordered his guards to teach a lesson to the suffragists imprisoned there because they dared to picket Woodrow Wilson’s White House for the right to vote.   For weeks, the women’s only water came from an open pail. Their food–all of it colorless slop–was infested with worms. When one of the leaders,  Alice Paul, embarked on a hunger strike, they tied her to a chair, forced a  tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited. She was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled our  to the press.   So, refresh my memory. Some women won’t vote this year because–why,  exactly? We have carpool duties? We have to get to work? Our vote doesn’t matter? It’s raining?   Last week, I went to a sparsely attended screening of HBO ‘s new movie ‘Iron Jawed Angels.’ It is a graphic depiction of the battle these women waged so that I could pull the curtain at the polling booth and have my say. I am  ashamed to say I needed the reminder.   All these years later, voter registration is still my passion. But the actual act of voting had become less personal for me, more rote. Frankly, voting often felt more like an obligation than a privilege. Sometimes it  was inconvenient.   My friend Wendy, who is my age and studied women’s history, saw the HBO movie, too. When she stopped by my desk to talk about it, she looked  angry. She was–with herself. ‘One thought kept coming back to me as I  watched that movie,’ she said. ‘What would those women think of the way I  use–or don’t use–my right to vote? All of us take it for granted now, not just younger women, but those of us who did seek to learn.’   The right to vote, she said, had become valuable to her ‘all over again.’  HBO released the movie on video and DVD. I wish all history, social studies and government teachers would include the movie in their curriculum. I want it shown on Bunco night, too, and anywhere else women gather. I realize this isn’t our usual idea of socializing, but we are not  voting in the numbers that we should be, and I think a little shock  therapy is in order.    It is jarring to watch Woodrow Wilson and his cronies try to persuade a psychiatrist to declare Alice Paul insane so that she could be permanently institutionalized. And it is inspiring to watch the doctor refuse. Alice Paul was strong, he said, and brave. That didn’t make her crazy.  The doctor admonished the men: ‘Courage in women is often mistaken for insanity.’     Please, if you are so inclined, pass this on to all the women you know.    We need to get out and vote and use this right that was fought so hard for by these very courageous women .  Whether you vote democratic,  republican or independent party – remember to vote.   History is being made

Bo the portugese water dog, vacation’s in Maine !
(I guess since they had to use the Gulfstream there just wasn’t enough room for the dog and one other person, and they couldn’t leave the dog behind)
Did you know that President Barack Hussein Obama flew Bo, their dog, in on a separate smaller jet to Maine for their vacation? I wonder if that sets well with all the unemployed, hurting, U S citizens who can’t afford food, but pay for this. The above is true. I Googled “Bo the dog flying to Maine ” and got 76,700 references verifying this. One of them follows:
Michelle Malkin: Just Plane Crazy: Obamas Dog Flies to Vacation on Separate Jet. Doug Powers: The Obamas arrived at their vacation spot in Maine, and the local paper, the Morning Sentinel, described the scene:
The president was the first to walk onto the tarmac, dressed casually in a pale blue Oxford shirt and khakis. A few minutes later, the
first lady, dressed in black caprice, a tank-top and sandals, walked onto the runway. Shortly afterward, Malia and Sasha joined their parents…
Arriving in a small jet before the Obamas was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U S Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. and the presidents personal aide Reggie Love. The president, who said the rest of us are going to have to sacrifice to get out of these hard economic times, let his dog fly on his own plane? Not enough room on Air Force One (a Gulfstream on this trip) for a Portuguese water dog and Reggie Love?
Oh, by the way, Mr. Love, Bo’s handler, is paid $102,000 a year to take care of him. What side of the ballot will you mark in November? This man is taking the nation for every cent he can and then some.

Three cheers for Arizona
The shoe is on the other foot and the Mexicans from the State of Sonora, Mexico doesn’t like it. Can you believe the nerve of these people? It’s almost funny. The State of Sonora is angry at the influx of Mexicans into Mexico. Nine state legislators from the Mexican State of Sonora traveled to Tucson to complain about Arizona’s new employer crackdown on illegals from Mexico.
It seems that many Mexican illegals are returning to their hometowns and the officials in the Sonora state government are ticked off.
A delegation of nine state legislators from Sonora was in Tucson on Tuesday to state that Arizona’s new Employer Sanctions Law will have a devastating effect on the Mexican state.
At a news conference, the legislators said that Sonora — Arizona’s southern neighbor, made up of mostly small towns — cannot handle the demand for housing, jobs and schools that it will face as Mexican workers return to their hometowns from the USA without jobs or money.
The Arizona law, which took effect Jan. 1, punishes Arizona employers who knowingly hire individuals without valid legal documents to work in the United States. Penalties include suspension of, or loss of, their business license.
The Mexican legislators are angry because their own citizens are returning to their hometowns, placing a burden on THEIR state government. ‘How can Arizona pass a law like this?’ asked Mexican Rep Leticia Amparano-Gamez, who represents Nogales.
‘There is not one person living in Sonora who does not have a friend or relative working in Arizona,’ she said, speaking in Spanish. ‘Mexico is not prepared for this, for the tremendous problems it will face as more and more Mexicans working in Arizona and who were sending money to their families return to their home-towns in Sonora without jobs,’ she said. ‘We are one family, socially and economically,’ she said of the people of Sonora and Arizona.
Wrong!
The United States is a sovereign nation, not a subsidiary of Mexico, and its taxpayers are not responsible for the welfare of Mexico’s citizens.
It’s time for the Mexican government, and its citizens, to stop feeding parasitically off the United States and to start taking care of its/their own needs.
Too bad that other states within the USA don’t pass a law just like that passed by Arizona.

This letter is not written in a spirit of hate, disrespect, nor is it motivated in any way by racial bias and is written with respect due the office and the awesome tasks that have been laid on your shoulders.
I write this letter because I am a tax paying American citizen who has experienced the American Dream and wants his children and grandchildren to have the same advantages and opportunities that he has had.
And no, Mr. President, I was not born into a one-percenter family, I come from a blue collar background, never went to college, have made a living doing manual labor and went into my chosen profession at ground level, worked hard and sacrificed to achieve success.
On April 13, 1967 I arrived in Nashville, Tennessee with a wife, a two-year-old baby, a twenty-dollar bill and the clutch out of my car.
I won’t go into the mountains and valleys that I’ve traveled since then except to say that I have been successful and somebody did help me build the business I own. Almighty God, not the government.
I employ thirty people, good citizens and family people, hard-working people, the kind of gun-clinging, God-fearing folks who make America the greatest nation the world has ever known.
Mr. President, it seems to me that you have little faith in American ingenuity, American capability, American exceptionalism and even American patriotism.
You seem to think that America needs a monolithic, big brother type government to oversee and regulate every aspect of American life, that citizens are not competent to control their own affairs and make their own decisions without some oppressive bureaucracy to call the shots.
Mr. President, the answer is not government, conversely, the problem is government. A government that has doubled the national debt, increased unemployment, lowered take home pay, increased food stamp participation and disability claims and introduced socialized medicine.
You support teacher’s unions which take political activism more seriously than education.
You intentionally lied to the American people about your stand on marriage being between a man and woman, and continue to lie when it is politically expedient for you to do so.
You surround yourself with inexperienced ideologues and political yes men and take the advice of individuals who are swimming in waters way too deep for them.
Your petulance is unbecoming, Mr. President, and your criticism of anyone who disagrees with you is downright unmanly. You come off like a spoiled child who has been denied his way.
And while you blame your shortcomings on opposing political parties, you had both houses of Congress and the White House in the first two years of your term. Plus an electoral mandate to do just about anything you wanted to, so the least you can do is cowboy up and take the blame for the messes you’ve made.
Your apparent disregard for the maintenance and morale of our armed services is extremely unwise and dangerous.
Mr. President, the office you hold is not a place for the faint of heart and when you draw a red line you’d dang well better be willing to back it up, because when you don’t every tyrant and despot in this world takes it for a sign of weakness and will take advantage, Putin and China being a prime example.
In making any kind of deal with Iran you spit in the face of Israel and plant the seeds of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
The last report showed that the US economy actually shrunk by .07% while the national debt and other obligations grow by the day.
No matter how many apologists come forth and no matter how much double talk you and the puppets who speak for you come up with, the greatest nation the world has ever known is losing a war with a small army of criminals and thugs that grows bigger every day simply because you don’t have the guts to face the problem.
You’re running out of diversions Mr. President, sleight of hand political policies eventually stop working and lies finally float to the top of water.
Time is running out for you Mr. President and the horrible thing about it is that time is running out for America too.
What do you think?
Pray for our troops and the peace of Jerusalem.
God Bless America

Jun 03rd, 2015, 2:24pm
But nothing changes no matter how much money is spent, no matter how many laws are passed, no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on TV, and no matter who is president. Some argue it’s a problem of culture, as if culture creates people’s behavior instead of the other way around. Others blame white privilege. But since 1965, when the elites opened Americas doors to the Third World, immigrants from Asia and India, people who are not white, not rich, and not connected, have quietly succeeded. While the children of these people are winning spelling bees and getting top scores on the SAT, black youths are committing half the country’s violent crime, which includes viciously punching random white people on the street for the thrill of it that has nothing to do with poverty.
The experiment has failed. Not because of white culture, or white privilege, or white racism. The fundamental problem is that American black culture has evolved into an unfixable and crime ridden mess. They do not want to change their culture or society, and expect others to tolerate their violence and amoral behavior. They have become socially incompatible with other races by their own design, not because of the racism of others – but by their own hatred of non-blacks. Our rulers don’t seem to understand just how tired their white subjects are with this experiment. They don’t understand that white people aren’t out to get black people; they are just exhausted with them. They are exhausted by the social pathologies, the violence, the endless complaints, and the blind racial solidarity, the bottomless pit of grievances, the excuses, and the reflexive animosity. The elites explain everything with racism, and refuse to believe that white frustration could soon reach the boiling point.”—

https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-true-military-record-of-john-mccain/	Former Arizona senator John McCain inflated or lied about his military record.	Not True	['donald trump', 'john mccain', 'trump administration']			2015/07/23	"THE TRUE MILITARY RECORD OF JOHN MCCAIN WRITTEN BY AN ACTIVE MARINE.
9/03/08
McCain has never really earned anything. He is from a wealth pampered background and not fit to lead this nation.
A “war hero” doesn’t finished 894th out of 899 and still get stationed at a Navy champagne unit and promoted ahead of all but two of his 898 other classmates.
A “war hero” doesn’t crash three U.S. Navy jets out of sheer incompetence and ineptitude, including two during non-combat training sessions.
A “war hero” doesn’t get written up on drunk-and-disorderly, fraternization, disobeying orders, and insubordination charges more than two dozen times in less than three years.
A “war hero” doesn’t get promoted to squadron commander of the air field named after his own grandfather immediately after crashing his third airplane. A “war hero” doesn’t have all the military records that cover his time in Vietnam and all disciplinary actions against him censored and sealed “as a matte r of national security.” A “war hero” doesn’t get 28 medals awarded all after-the-fact “for bravery” for no other reason than being shot down and captured and then go on a celebrity public relations tour because he’s the son of two acclaimed Navy admirals. A “war hero” doesn’t repeatedly cheat on the wife who’s back in the states waiting for him, and then cheat on her more when he returns to the states, and then divorce and abandon her.
A “war hero” doesn’t systematically vote against every single pay and benefit increase for military and veterans throughout his entire political career, all the while claiming to be “the soldier’s Congressman,” and then take credit for the passage of a G.I. benefits bill he that voted AGAINST. A “war hero” McCain III lost jet number one in 1958 when he plunged into Corpus Christi Bay while practicing landings. He was knocked unconscious by the impact coming to as the plane settled to the bottom. McCain’s second crash occurred while he was deployed in the Mediterranean. “Flying too low over the Iberian Peninsula,” Timberg wrote, “he took out some power lines [reminiscent of the 1998 incident in which a Marine Corps jet sliced through the cables of a gondola at an Italian ski resort, killing 20] which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral.”
McCain’s third crash three occurred when he was returning from flying a Navy trainer solo to Philadelphia for an Army-Navy football game. Timberg reported that McCain radioed, “I’ve got a flameout” and went through standard relight procedures three times before ejecting at one thousand feet. McCain landed on a deserted beach moments before the plane slammed into a clump of trees. McCain’s fifth loss happened during his 23rd mission over North Vietnam on Oct. 26, 1967, when McCain’s A-4 Skyhawk was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. McCain ejected from the plane breaking both arms an d a leg in the process and subsequently parachuted into Truc Bach Lake near Hanoi. For 23 combat missions (an estimated 20 hours over enemy territory), the U.S. Navy awarded McCain a Silver Star, a Legion of Merit for Valor, a Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Stars, two Commendation medals plus two Purple Hearts and a dozen service medals. “McCain had roughly 20 hours in combat,” explains Bill Bell, a veteran of Vietnam and former chief of the U.S. Office for POW/MIA Affairs — the first official U.S. representative in Vietnam since the 1973 fall of Saigon. “Since McCain got 28 medals,” Bell continues, “that equals out to about a medal-and-a-half for each hour he spent in combat. There were infantry guys — grunts on the ground — who had more than 7,000 hours in combat and I can tell you that there were times and situations where I’m sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison
The question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down.” For years, McCain has been an unchecked master at manipulating an overly friendly and biased news media. The former POW turned Congressman, turned U.S. Senator, has managed to gloss over his failures as a pilot by exaggerating his military service and lying about his feats of heroism. McCain has sprouted a halo and wings to become America’s POW-hero presidential candidate.
This article was written by an active, unnamed Marine. It was published by Gale Toensing founder of the Corner Report.com and she sent it to me. It is a true account of McCain’s real war record and evidence of his lack of fitness for the office of President.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-truth-about-carly-by-former-hp-board-member-tom-perkins/	"“The Truth About Carly” By Former HP Board Member Tom PerkinsAuthorship Confirmed!
Summary of eRumor:
Former Hewlett Packard board member Tom Perkins wrote an essay titled “The Truth About Carly” that defends Carly Fiorina’s business track record.
The Truth:
Former HewlettPackard board member and venture capitalist Tom Perkins purchased a fullpage ad in the New York Times on August 27, 2015, to publish his essay, “The Truth About Carly.”
Tom Perkins wrote “The Truth About Carly” in response to an earlier report by New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin headlined, “Carly Fiornia’s Business Record: Not So Sterling.”
Sorkin wrote that Carly Fiornina had misrepresented her track record as CEO of HewlettPackard on the campaign trail. She made an “ill"	fated” decision to merge the company with Compaq. The merger led to 30,000 layoffs and low stock prices before the it was eventually called off, and she was fired, Sorkin wrote:				2015/09/29	"“Carly Fiorina’s Business Record: Not So Sterling”
The consensus is clear: Carly Fiorina won the first Republican Primary debate. As a result she is climbing the polls and into the top tier of candidates. Her rise has led pundits to speculate about her tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard.
I was a member of the HP Board of Directors much of the time Carly was the CEO. I was in the room for many of the decisions she made. I can attest to the strength of Carly’s leadership, the accuracy of her vision and the quality of her management.
Carly was an excellent CEO. She led HP through one of the worst economic times in decades. Less than two years into Carly’s leadership, the dot com bubble went bust. Silicon Valley was in chaos. Companies were shedding jobs almost daily. There were so many layoffs The Associated Press ran weekly announcements regarding layoffs at tech companies. And The San Francisco Chronicle declared 2001 “The Year of the Layoff.”
While other Silicon Valley icons like Sun Microsystems disappeared, Carly’s vision and execution not only helped to save HP but made it a strong, more versatile company that could compete in the changing technology sector.
I was on the Compaq Board during the HP-Compaq merger and remained a member of the new HP Board once the merger was complete. Both companies knew that we needed something dramatic to inject life back into our companies. The merger, while controversial, was unanimously approved by every member of the HP Board and won approval from shareholders. Thanks to Carly’s leadership there was a path forward for this storied but troubled company.
Critics questioned the move, but history proves Carly was right. Post merger, HP became the biggest computer company in the world. It positioned HP to compete in integrated systems and allowed us to compete in sectors beyond the core strength of the company, printers.
Carly was hired at HP because it was struggling. Revenues were down, quarterly earnings were missed, innovation lagged and growth stagnated. HP, once the leader in Silicon Valley, was clinging to the status quo and failing to embrace the new tech era. Silicon Valley companies were prospering by taking advantage of the new technologies; HP was stubbornly clinging to the past. HP needed a change agent and someone who could return the company to its glory days. Carly was the right choice.
The results of Carly’s transformational leadership? HP revenues doubled to more than $80 billion, innovation tripled to 15 patents per day, the growth rate more than quadrupled 6.5 percent and we grew to become the 11th largest company in the country. Carly did what she was brought in to do: turn the company around make it successful again. Not only did she save the company from the dire straits it was in, she laid the foundation for HP’s future growth.
Critics often claim was fired at HP because she was unsuccessful. As a member of the board, I can tell you this is not true. In truth, it was the Board I was a part of that was ineffective and dysfunctional. The HP board of directors included family members of the founders. Carly worked with the hand she was dealt as best as one could. While Carly fought to save the company and the employees within, some board members fought for their own power or advancement. You see, some board members wanted to micro-manage the company, hand picking friends and allies to run divisions. This is no way to run a global company and Carly had the strength of character and courage of conviction to stand up to it and ultimately she lost her job because of it.
While lesser leaders would have accepted offers of transition plans and graceful resignations, Carly would have none of that. Carly demanded to be fired. In order to restore peace to the board I voted to fire her. That was a mistake.
In the months and years after Carly left, the Board of Directors remained dysfunctional. The Board members who plotted Carly’s ouster eventually resigned after an embarrassing investigation by Congress.
I have no question that Carly is a transformational leader who uniquely has both vision and the expertise to implement it. We are in the middle of a heated election, and often facts and the truth get lost in the heat of partisan rhetoric. As someone who worked with and observed Carly first hand I can attest to her abilities, intellect and talent. I am proud to support Carly Fiorina for President of the United States.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/charles-krauthammer-calls-the-clinton-foundation-organized-crime/	Charles Krauthammer: The Clinton Foundation is Organized Crime	Truth! & Fiction!				2016/01/12	"I received an email where Charles Krauthammer supposedly dissected how The Clinton Foundation acts as a money laundering front, and works only to enrich the Clinton family.
According to Krauthammer, this foundation should be illegal and certainly represents a conflict of interest. The Clinton Foundation is “organized crime” at its finest, and we are financing it.
Below is a summary of how the Clinton Foundation works as a tax free international money laundering scheme. It may eventually prove to be the largest political criminal enterprise in U.S. history, and the foundation provides a textbook case on how you hide foreign money sent to you and repackage it to be used for your own purposes. All tax free.
Here’s how it works:
1. You create a separate foreign “charity.” In this case one in Canada.
2. Foreign oligarchs and governments, then donate to this Canadian charity. In this case, over 1,000 did — contributing mega millions. I’m sure they did this out of the goodness of their hearts, and expected nothing in return. (Imagine Putin’s buddies waking up one morning and just deciding to send untold millions to a Canadian charity).
3. The Canadian charity then bundles these separate donations and makes a massive donation to the Clinton Foundation.
4. The Clinton Foundation and the cooperating Canadian charity claim Canadian law prohibits the identification of individual donors.
Oh, by the way, the Canadian “charity” includes as a principal one Frank Giustra. Google him. He is the guy who was central to the formation of Uranium One, the Canadian company that somehow acquired massive U.S. uranium interests and then sold them to an organization controlled by Russia. This transaction required U.S. State Department approval, and guess who was Secretary of State when the approval was granted. As an aside, imagine how former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell feels. That poor schlep is in jail because he and his wife took $165,000 in gifts and loans for doing minor favors for a guy promoting a vitamin company. Not legal but not exactly putting U.S. security t risk.
5. The Clinton Foundation then spends some of this money for legitimate good works programs. Experts estimate that The Clinton Foundation has donated no more than 15 percent of the donations to charitable pursuits. Much of the balance goes to enrich the Clinton’s lavish salaries, and lavish lifestyle, particularly travel, and virtually all tax free. In on year alone, the foundation spent over $8 million in travel expenses.
6. The Clinton Foundation, with access to the world’s best accountants, somehow fails to report much of this on their tax filings. They discover these “clerical errors” and begin the process of re-filing 5 years of tax returns.
7. Net result — foreign money, much of it from other countries, goes into the Clinton’s pockets tax free and untraceable back to the original donor. This is the textbook definition of money laundering.
If you’re still not persuaded this was a cleverly structured way to get unidentified foreign money to the Clinton’s, ask yourself these questions: Why did these foreign interests funnel money through a Canadian charity? Why not donate directly to the Clinton Foundation? Better yet, why not donate money directly to the people, organizations and countries in need?
This is the essence of money laundering and influence peddling.
Now you know why Hillary’s destruction of 30,000 e-mails was a risk she was willing to take.
Bill and Hillary are devious, unprincipled, dishonest and criminal, and they are Slick! Warning: They could be back in the White House in January 2017. Don’t let it happen. Remember, most people are not well informed. You must inform and educate them.

Summary of eRumor:
Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan has supposedly written a column on Donald Trump headlined, “Trump  Things You Might Not Know About Him.”
The Truth:
Peggy Noonan didn’t write the “Things You Might Not Know” column on Trump.
That rumor surfaced when Peggy Noonan’s byline was added to an old forwarded email about Donald Trump and message boards like this one in early January 2015. A message attached to the column said it had appeared in the Wall Street Journal “this past weekend.”
But the column doesn’t appear in Peggy Noonan’s archived columns, or anywhere else on the Wall Street Journal’s website. In fact, the so"	"called Peggy Noonan column on Donald Trump first appeared in August 2015 as an anonymous forwarded email. Noonan’s name was apparently added to the text to lend it credibility.
 
 "				2016/01/07	"Peggy Noonan wrote about Trump this weekend in her Wall Street Journal column:
Trump – Things You Might Not Know About Him
Trump, hopefully, is waking some of the RINOs up. The criticisms of Trump are amazingly missing something. They are lacking in negative stories from those who work for him or have had business dealings with him. After all the employees he’s had and all the business deals he’s made there is a void of criticism. In fact, long term employees call him a strong and merciful leader and say he is far more righteous and of high integrity than people may think. And while it may surprise many, he’s actually humble when it comes to his generosity and kindness. A good example is a story that tells of his limo breaking down on a deserted highway outside of New York City. A middle-aged couple stopped to help him and as a thank you he paid off their mortgage, but he didn’t brag about that. Generous and good people rarely talk of charity they bestow on others.But as much as all this is interesting, the real thing that people want to know is what Donald Trump’s plan is for America. It’s funny how so many people say they don’t know what it is, or they act like Trump is hiding it. The information is readily available if people would just do a little homework. But, since most Americans won’t.
1.) Trump believes that America should not intervene militarily in other country’s problems without being compensated for doing so. If America is going to risk the lives of our soldiers and incur the expense of going to war, then the nations we help must be willing to pay for our help. Using the Iraq War as an example, he cites the huge monetary expense to American taxpayers (over $1.5 trillion, and possibly much more depending on what sources are used to determine the cost) in addition to the cost in human life. He suggests that Iraq should have been required to give us enough of their oil to pay for the expenses we incurred. He includes in those expenses the medical costs for our military and $5 million for each family that lost a loved one in the war and $2 million for each family of soldiers who received severe injuries.
2.) Trump wants America to have a strong military again. He believes the single most important function of the federal government is national defense. He has said he wants to find the General Patton or General MacArthur that could lead our military buildup back to the strength it needs to be. While he hasn’t said it directly that I know of, Trump’s attitude about America and about winning tells me he’d most likely be quick to eliminate rules of engagement that handicap our military in battle. Clearly Trump is a “win at all costs” kind of guy, and I’m sure that would apply to our national defense and security, too
3.) Trump wants a strong foreign policy and believes that it must include 7 core principles American interests come first. Always. No apologies. Maximum firepower and military preparedness. Only go to war to win. Stay loyal to your friends and suspicious of your enemies.Keep the technological sword razor sharp. See the unseen Prepare for threats before they materialize. Respect and support our present and past warriors.
4.) Trump believes that terrorists who are captured should be treated as military combatants, not as criminals like the Obama administration treats them.
5.) Trump makes the point that China’s manipulation of their currency has given them unfair advantage in our trade dealings with them. He says we must tax their imports to offset their currency manipulation, which will cause American companies to be competitive again and drive manufacturing back to America and create jobs here. Although he sees China as the biggest offender, he believes that America should protect itself from all foreign efforts to take our jobs and manufacturing. For example, Ford is building a plant in Mexico and Trump suggests that every part or vehicle Ford makes in Mexico be taxed 35% if they want to bring it into the U. S., which would cause companies like Ford to no longer be competitive using their Mexican operations and move manufacturing back to the U.S., once again creating jobs here.
6.) Trump wants passage of NOPEC legislation (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act – NOPEC – S.394), which would allow the government to sue OPEC for violating antitrust laws. According to Trump, that would break up the cartel. He also wants to unleash our energy companies to drill domestically (sound like Sarah Palin’s drill baby, drill?) thereby increasing domestic production creating jobs and driving domestic costs of oil and gas down while reducing dependence on foreign oil.
7.) Trump believes a secure border is critical for both security and prosperity in America. He wants to build a wall to stop illegals from entering and put controls on immigration. (And he says he’ll get Mexico to pay for the wall, which many have scoffed at, but given his business successes I wouldn’t put it past him.) He also wants to enforce our immigration laws and provide no path to citizenship for illegals.
8.) Trump wants a radical change to the tax system to not only make it better for average Americans, but also to encourage businesses to stay here and foreign businesses to move here. The resulting influx of money to our nation would do wonders for our economy. He wants to make America the place to do business. He also wants to lower the death tax and the taxes on capital gains and dividends. This would put more than $1.6 trillion back into the economy and help rebuild the 1.5 million jobs we’ve lost to the current tax system. He also wants to charge companies who outsource jobs overseas a 20% tax, but for those willing to move jobs back to America they would not be taxed. And for citizens he has a tax plan that would allow Americans to keep more of what they earn and spark economic growth. He wants to change the personal income tax to: Up to $30,000 taxed at 1%. From $30,000 to $100,000 taxed at 5%. From $100,000 to $1,000,000 taxed at 10%. $1,000,000 and above taxed at 15%.
9.) Trump wants Obamacare repealed. He says it’s a “job-killing, health care-destroying monstrosity” that “can’t be reformed, salvaged, or fixed.” He believes in allowing real competition in the health insurance marketplace to allow competition to drive prices down. He also believes in tort reform to get rid of defensive medicine and lower costs.
10.) Trump wants spending reforms in Washington, acknowledging that America spends far more than it receives in revenue. He has said he believes that if we don’t stop increasing the national debt once it hits $24 trillion it will be impossible to save this country.
11.) Even though he says we need to cut spending, he does not want to harm those on Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. He believes that the citizens have faithfully paid in to the system to have these services available and that the American government has an obligation to fulfill its end of the bargain and provide those benefits. Therefore, he wants to build the economy up so that we have the revenue to pay those costs without cutting the benefits to the recipients. He disagrees with Democrats who think raising taxes is the answer and says that when you do that you stifle the economy. On the other hand, when you lower taxes and create an environment to help businesses they will grow, hire more workers, and those new workers will be paying taxes that become more tax revenue for the government.
12.) Trump also wants reform of the welfare state saying that America needs “a safety net, not a hammock.” He believes in a welfare to work program that would help reduce the welfare roles and encourage people to get back to work. And he wants a crackdown on entitlement fraud.
13.) Trump believes climate change is a hoax.
14.) Trump opposes Common Core.
15.) Trump is pro-life, although he allows for an exception due to rape, incest, or the life of the mother.
16.) Trump is pro 2nd Amendment rights.
17.) Trump’s view on same-sex marriage is that marriage is between a man and a woman, but he also believes that this is a states rights issue, not a federal issue.

Interesting take on Trump
They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump. Don’t be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.
It’s about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it’s in all of their interests to protect one another. It’s one for all and all for one.
It’s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We’re the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before.
Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.
It’s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It’s because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club. They talk big, but they won’t change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations. . .like Big Pharma or Big Oil.
Or they are owned lock, stock and barrel by foreigners, like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary with their Clinton Foundation donations.
These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there’s one man who isn’t beholden to anyone. There’s one man who doesn’t need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher’s union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.
Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn’t need anyone’s help. That means he doesn’t care what the media says. He doesn’t care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.
Don’t you ever wonderwhy the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don’t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don’t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to defund Obamacare or Obama’s clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right? First, I’d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.
Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists . . . so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth , why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you’re a good old boy,you’ve got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.
But Trump doesn’t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama’s birth certificate. He questioned Obama’s college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he’s doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He’s questioning our relationship with Mexico; he’s questioning why the border is wide open; he’s questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he’s questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he’s questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he’s questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.
Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I’m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare’s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama’s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama’s college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?
Obama, the multinational corporations, and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control . If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump’s election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked booksand Obama’s records, the game is over. The gig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails, or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.
Obamacare will be defunded and dismantled. And Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. 
Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That’s why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump. Yes, it’s become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can’t silence him. And they sure can’t intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he’s the one telling the truth.

“In the recent Republican presidential debate, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he would base a new tax system on the biblical system of tithing. “I think God is a pretty fair guy,” he said. “And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn’t matter how much you make. If you’ve had a bumper crop, you don’t owe me triple tithes. And if you’ve had no crops at all, you don’t owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that.”
“He added: “And that’s why I’ve advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes.”
“But, more importantly,” Carson went on, “the system of tithing would just be the beginning. An introduction, if you will. Because, sooner or later, people would find ways to cheat it and the whole system would inevitably be thrown out of balance once again. That’s why I believe that a tax system based on sin would be a more permanent, cheat-proof solution.”

Just a Friendly Reminder
A very interesting column. COMPLETELY NEUTRAL
Be sure to Read the Poem at the end.
Charley Reese’s final column for the Orlando Sentinel.
He has been a journalist for 49 years.
He is retiring and this is HIS LAST COLUMN.
Be sure to read the Tax List at the end.
This is about as clear and easy to understand as it can be. The article below is completely neutral, neither anti-republican or democrat. Charlie Reese, a retired reporter for the Orlando Sentinel, has hit the nail directly on the head, defining clearly who it is that in the final analysis must assume responsibility for the judgments made that impact each one of us every day. It’s a short but good read. Worth the time. Worth remembering!
545 vs. 300,000,000 People
– By Charlie Reese
Politicians are the only people in the world who create problems and then campaign against them.
Have you ever wondered, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY do we have deficits?
Have you ever wondered, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes?
You and I don’t propose a federal budget. The President does.
You and I don’t have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does.
You and I don’t write the tax code, Congress does.
You and I don’t set fiscal policy, Congress does.
You and I don’t control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does.
One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one President, and nine Supreme Court justices equates to 545 human beings out of the 300 million are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.
I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, central bank.
I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a President to do one cotton-picking thing. I don’t care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator’s responsibility to determine how he votes.
Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this common con regardless of party.
What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating deficits. The President can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it.
The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the speaker of the House? John Boehner. He is the leader of the majority party. He and fellow House members, not the President, can approve any budget they want. If the President vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to.
It seems inconceivable to me that a nation of 300 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted — by present facts — of incompetence and irresponsibility.. I can’t think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist.
If the tax code is unfair, it’s because they want it unfair.
If the budget is in the red, it’s because they want it in the red.
If the Army & Marines are in Iraq and Afghanistan it’s because they want them in Iraq and Afghanistan.
If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it’s because they want it that way.
There are no insoluble government problems.
Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish; to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject; to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like “the economy”,”inflation,” or “politics” that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do.
Those 545 people, and they alone, are responsible.
They, and they alone, have the power.
They, and they alone, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses.
Provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees.
We should vote all of them out of office and clean up their mess.

His family managed to send him to the University of Chicago. Despite a prestigious degree, however, Sanders failed to earn a living, even as an adult. It took him 40 years to collect his first steady paycheck — and it was a government check.
“I never had any money my entire life,” Sanders told Vermont public TV in 1985, after settling into his first real job as mayor of Burlington. . . .
Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail. “He was a shi**y carpenter,” a friend told Politico Magazine. “His carpentry was not going to support him, and didn’t.”
Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about “masturbation and rape” and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was “always poor” and his “electricity was turned off a lot.” They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment — and this is what his friends had to say about him.
The only thing he was good at was talking … non-stop … about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off. “The whole quality of life in America is based on greed,” the bitter layabout said. “I believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation.”
So he tried politics.

Not True	['airplanes', 'donald trump', 'fox news', 'military', 'operation desert storm', 'sean hannity']			2016/03/04	"Al Closson This is a Must Read! In 1991, at the end of Desert Storm, a 19 yr old US Army Cavalry Scout Private who had just spent 8 months at war sat out on a street at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. He sat there on his duffle bag with his Battalion around him for 4 days waiting for the buses to come and take him to the King Fahad Airport so he could go home. Unfortunately, the politicians of the day never planned for how to bring so many soldiers home after the war ended so there was a shortage of planes. Politicians are great at talking, but terrible at doing. Finally, the buses came, and took the young man to the airport. The planes waiting were from Tower Air. The owner of Tower Air had volunteered his planes and staff to bring soldiers home for the cost of fuel only. Happily, the young veteran got home just in time for Easter weekend in 1991, and spent that time emotionally healing with friends and family surrounding him. That Private was me.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/transcript-of-hillary-clintons-goldman-sachs-speech-released/	Transcript of Hillary Clinton’s Goldman Sachs Speech Released	Fiction!				2016/02/29	"The following is a leaked transcript of Hillary Clinton’s 1st speech to Goldman Sachs delivered on 6/04/2013. Two other speeches are also rumored to be in circulation. This is the full transcript. Secretary Clinton received $225,000 for this speech.
HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lloyd [Blankfein], and thanks to everyone at Goldman Sachs for welcoming me today. I’m delighted to be back among friends, colleagues, collaborators, supporters, kindred spirits…
Let me jump right in. You know, over the past few months, there have been popular concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for the majority of Americans. It’s not “delivering” the way that they feel it should, that they feel entitled to. Most Americans that you speak to, speak a populist rhetoric that claims it is stacked for those at the top, that those of you here have it too good.
(Laughter)
But we know the hopes that the little people have for their future — things like school, job, food, clothing on their backs– all of those little things would not be possible without your leadership and innovation. Since the time of the Medicis, even before, and the financing of the first joint stock companies in the transatlantic slave trade, we know that finance and banking is what makes our capitalist economy not just grow but tick…
Previous generations of Americans built this economy and a middle class on a collective illusion: that they do productive work, this creates wealth, and that this builds the economy. We all know how misguided that is. We know that it’s really due to your investing, credit, and stewardship, that they have been able to work at all, that they are able to put food in their tiny bellies. It’s due to you (and other banking, trading, investment houses) that we have an economy that works at all. You are why we are a truly 21st century economic power.
(Applause)
You, Lloyd, and your colleagues, have been instrumental in that. People say you are overpaid or even parasitic, parasites on the economic body, and they quote a long line of seemingly “unethical behavior” . They equate with you everything that is wrong and immoral with Capitalism, they charge that you have acted ruthlessly and unethically, “rigging every major market bubble since the Great Depression”.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/questions-about-marco-rubios-gay-arrest/	Questions about Marco Rubio’s Gay Arrest	 Reported as Fiction!				2016/02/23	"As a quick summary: we know that the man Rubio was arrested with in 1990 was sued by Miami in 2007 for running a gay pornography studio out of one of his properties. We believe the totality of the evidence strongly implies that Rubio was engaged in sexual relations with that man in 1990, and that’s why they were arrested. Full story below.
The story, published on January 21st, notes that Rubio was with his friend, Angel Barrios, and another unnamed young man, when they were stopped by the police in Alice C. Wainwright Park at about 10 PM on May 23, 1990. Unfortunately, the article does not give very much information about Mr. Barrios, other than the fact that he owns several coin-operated laundries in the Miami area. So we decided to try and find out who this guy is. His LinkedIn page was easy to find: www.linkedin. com/in/angel-barrios-19387360. Further searches revealed a case filed by the City of Miami against an Angel Barrios in 2007, seeking to enjoin him from allowing the use of his residential property for business purposes (http://www.miamigov.com/cityattorney/docs/litigation/Litigation-Report-Dec-2011.pdf). What were these business purposes? The production of pornography for distribution over the internet, by a company named Flava Works. What kind of pornography? Gay pornography: flavaworks.com (warning NSFW).
Okay, but maybe “Angel Barrios” is a common name. Maybe they’re totally different Angels! But one of the co-defendants in the City of Miami’s suit was “Barrios Investment Group.” And according to Mr. Barrios’ LinkedIn profile, linked above, what company did he own from 1995-2007? Barrios Investment Group. Angel Barrios the coin-operated-laundromat-owning childhood friend of Marco Rubio is assuredly Angel Barrios, the man sued by Miami in 2007 for running a gay pornography studio out of one of his residential properties.
Now, the story itself notes that this park was notorious at the time for deviant, illegal activity: “Gang warfare, gunfire, prostitution (straight and gay), drug dealing and muggings.” A police officer quoted in the story notes that people went there to drink, do drugs and have sex. So the story itself notes, twice, that this park was frequently used for public sex, both gay and straight. For cruising. A quick google search for “wrainwright park cruising” confirms this, with reviews of the park including: “Wander through and see what you can find. Afternoons are sometimes busy with business men looking for a quickie over lunch. Crowd: Young guys looking for a blow job. Local latinos with loving to share.” Nonetheless, the article seems to ignore the possibility that young Rubio may have been stopped and arrested for having public sex in that parked car.
Of course, you say, that’s a mighty big leap, to assume he was having sex. Angel Barrios, quoted frequently in the article, notes that they were just “hanging out.” But the information offered by and about Mr. Barrios in the article is deeply suspicious. He seems to be fraught with guilt about that night (“We never even used to go to that area,” he said. “That might have been the first time I went there.”); he says he does not remember key facts about the night (“I don’t think we got handcuffed and taken to jail”); Rubio apparently dedicated an intimate senior yearbook quote to Mr. Barrios; and the two shared a townhouse together after graduating from high school.
So, in 1990, Marco Rubio was found by the police “hanging out” in a parked car, in a dark and secluded park with a reputation as a gay cruising spot, with another young man who he was very very close to, who he lived with after high school, who went on to run a gay pornography studio out of one of his properties. Obviously, nothing is definitive here; unfortunately there is no photo of Angel and Marco caught naked together. But all the facts added together, along with the fact that Rubio has been dogged with rumors about sexual deviancy for his entire career, do seem to be awfully, awfully suspicious.

Hillary Clinton made a campaign stop yesterday in Beaumont, Texas. Only six people were there to greet her. Her security detail outnumbered her supporters by quite a bit. She wouldn’t talk, wave to or even acknowledge those there to greet her. As bad as that is, it’s not the real story here. The real story is who she took a private meeting with. After landing, Clinton headed off to a fundraiser in West Beaumont, where she was greeted by around 150-200 Muslims, most of whom were of Pakistani origin. The event was held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed and Hillary raised approximately $500,000 by pandering to Muslims, making it “one of the top five private fundraiser’s Clinton has had in this country.” She’s bought and paid for by them. Spread this far and wide. You will not see it on national news but this is what is going on. Sheila Jackson Lee was there as well.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/peter-ticktin-donald-trump-authorship-confirmed/	Peter Ticktin on Donald Trump	Authorship Confirmed!				2016/03/10	"VOTE AS YOU WISH, AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP – – A personal note from Peter Ticktin who knows the guy from high school:
As a law firm, we at The Ticktin Law Group do not like to get involved in politics. As soon as we endorse one side, we risk alienating everyone on the other side. Also, our lawyers and staff are, themselves, on both sides. Politics is not our game. However, Justice is!
If you saw a guy get publicly smeared, and you knew him well from the days you were friends and seniors together in high school, if you knew him to be a decent and honest man, would you want to say something? This is why I need to share what I know.
I was aghast at watching last night’s debate. It was a set-up. The moderators, Cruz, and Rubio were all like little alligators trying to take a bite out of Trump. Yes, Donald Trump has had some failures, but he has been exceedingly successful. None of this came out. Instead, there was a general attack. Rubio simply makes up lies. He pretends that Trump has small hands and makes fun of him for something which isn’t even real. He pretends that Donald wets his pants, and makes fun of him, as though it was true, and then he calls Donald Trump a “Bully.”
I am not suggesting that you should vote or not vote for anyone. I just need to defend a former friend who is being smeared.
Like Donald Trump, I attended New York Military Academy (“NYMA”) for high school. In fact, in our senior year, together, Donald was my captain, and I was his 1st Platoon Sergeant. I sometimes joke that I ran his first company for him, Company “A.”
People don’t really change much from the ages of 17 and 18, and I know this guy. I know him to be a good decent guy. We lived and breathed an Honor Code in those years. It wasn’t just a rule. It was our way of life. Neither Donald, nor any other cadet who graduated with us would ever lie, cheat, or steal from a fellow cadet. These values became irreversibly intertwined in the fabric of our personalities, of who we are.
Of the 99 guys (no girls in those days) in our class, there is not one who I know who has a bad word to say about Donald Trump. Think of it. With all the jealousies which arise in high school and thereafter, with all the potential envy, not one of us has anything other than positive memories of this man. How could we? He was an “A” student, a top athlete, and as a leader, he was highly respected. We never feared him, yet we never wanted to disappoint him. He had our respect. He was never a bigot in any way, shape or form. He only hates those who hate. Of course he denounces the KKK.
As to the discussion with the New York Times, it is his choice to release the ‘off the record’ remarks. However, if he does, it opens the door for all political opposition to make that demand for everyone, and that means that our press will never get those ‘off the record’ remarks which help them to understand the realities of the campaign. Moreover, the idea that Donald Trump confessed some alternate theory of his position is preposterous. Can anyone believe that all those NY Times reporters are walking around knowing some deep dark nasty secret about a guy who is seeking an endorsement?
The Republican establishment is afraid of Donald Trump. Why? They are afraid that he will lose to Hillary. They don’t hate Donald. They hate her. They are so fearful that they fail to see that by expanding the base of voters for Trump, he is more likely to win.
Watching the chorus of whiners, decriers, denigrators, and self-righteous put-down experts from so many directions, from Mit Romney, to Megyn Kelly, Little Mario, it has to make you wonder. Why? Why are so many people so angry with Donald Trump, that they are lying, name calling, ridiculing, and demeaning him as they do. Either they are afraid, or they know him to be evil.
This is why I feel the need to speak out at this time. I know this man. He is a lot of things, but he is not evil. He is a decent honest guy who loves this country, and who is willing to sacrifice so much of what is left of his life, because he knows that this country needs to be fixed, and that it is going to require someone who can do the job. He just doesn’t see anything around him other than political hacks, so he is willing to take this huge responsibility.
I’m not saying that he is the only one who can do the job. My point is simply as to his motivation and his goodness.
This next decade is going to be one of major changes. We all see the climate changing, and the world food supply is getting lower. Our fish stock around the world is running low. Oil prices will cause countries to fail. The Middle East is beyond repair, and we have become weak and ineffective around the world. Donald Trump sees the issues and knows that he can assemble leaders who would have the best chance of fixing things. This is why he is running. He does not need it for his own aggrandizement. He doesn’t need another big jet or to take up residence in the White House. He just wants things to be fixed, and he knows that the politicians won’t fix anything.
I knew Donald Trump and was close to him in our senior year in high school. I just want you to know that there is nothing to fear from him. His character is as good as it gets. He is a patriot, taking on a heroic task, and being thanked by massive abuse.
If you want to see a true reflection of a man, look at his children. Need I say more?

Easter is a time for remembering that Muslims killed Jesus, according to Donald Trump.
“People ask me why I don’t like Muslims, and I say ‘duh’, it’s because they nailed Jesus to the cross with those Muslamic nails of theirs. Page 545 of the Bible I think it is, there in black and white, Muhammad Pilate and his henchmen killing Jesus.”

DIVORCE AGREEMENT– WRITTEN BY YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENT The person who wrote this is a college (law) student. Perhaps there is hope for us after all.
DIVORCE AGREEMENT
THIS IS SO INCREDIBLY WELL PUT AND I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT’S BY A YOUNG PERSON, A STUDENT!!! WHATEVER HE RUNS FOR, I’LL VOTE FOR HIM.
Dear American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists and Obama supporters, et al: We have stuck together since the late 1950’s for the sake of the kids, but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has clearly run its course.
Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all, so let’s just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way.
Here is our separation agreement:
–Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes.
–We don’t like redistributive taxes so you can keep them.
–You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. –Since you hate guns and war, we’ll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA and the military.
–We’ll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and the coal mines, and you can go with wind, solar and biodiesel.
–You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore and Rosie O’Donnell. You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them.
–We’ll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart and Wall Street.
–You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, homeless, homeboys, hippies, druggies and illegal aliens.
–We’ll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO’s and rednecks.
–We’ll keep Bill O’Reilly, and Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood .
–You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we’ll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.
–You can have the peaceniks and war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we’ll help provide them security.
–We’ll keep our Judeo-Christian values.
–You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, political correctness and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N. but we will no longer be paying the bill.
–We’ll keep the SUV’s, pickup trucks and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Volt and Leaf you can find.
–You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors.
–We’ll keep “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “The National anthem.”
–I’m sure you’ll be happy to substitute “Imagine”, “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing”, “Kum Ba Ya” or “We Are the World”.
–We’ll practice trickle-down economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot.
–Since it often so offends you, we’ll keep our history, our name and our flag.
Would you agree to this? If so, please pass it along to other like-minded liberal and conservative patriots and if you do not agree, just hit delete. In the spirit of friendly parting, I’ll bet you might think about which one of us will need whose help in 15 years.
Sincerely,
John J. Wall
Law Student and an American
P.S. Also, please take Ted Turner, Sean Penn, Martin & Charlie Sheen, Barbara Streisand, & ( Hanoi ) Jane Fonda with you.
P.S.S. And you won’t have to press 1 for English when you call our country.

['hillary clinton', 'media', 'the clintons']			2016/06/10	"A feature of oligarchy is the dynastic ascension of new leaders, children who rise to positions of power and wealth simply by the luck of birth. We welcome Chelsea Clinton to the club.
 
Earning $445 Per Second at NBC
 
Unlike most well-to-do young people who, after a decent education, take a series of unpaid internships and entry-level positions to begin working their way up some corporate ladder, Chelsea jumped more than a few rungs. Despite never having attended journalism school or otherwise having worked in the field, Chelsea was hired by NBC News to do feel-good stories as part of their “Making a Difference” series. Though the starting salary for such positions is already a chunky $100,000-200,000, Chelsea is being paid $600,000 a year for the same work.
 
Or less work. Here is a list of Chelsea’s recent NBC stories:
 
– June 10, NBC Nightly News, on diabetes.
– June 10, Today show, on a car accident in New Jersey.
– June 5, NBC Nightly News, General Motors safety scandal.
– June 4, Today show, missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.
– June 4, NBC Nightly News, about people pointing lasers at aircraft.
– June 3, NBC Nightly News, food-borne illnesses.
– June 2, Interviewed the Geico gecko, an animated character who sells insurance.
 
All told, in her almost three-year tenure at NBC, Chelsea has worked on all of 14 stories.
 
Business Insider calculated since starting work in November 2011, Chelsea earned about $26,724 for each minute she appeared on air, or $445 per second. As in one-two-three = $1335, there’s your month’s rent.
 
NBC has an eye for talent, at least the talent of children of important politicians. In 2009, it hired George W. Bush’s daughter Jenna to serve as a correspondent on the Today” show. In 2011, it hired Senator John McCain’s daughter Meghan as a contributor on MSNBC.
 
More Chelsea $$$$$$$$
 
But back to Chelsea. She told the New York Times in 2011 when hired by NBC she intended to donate most of the money she earned to the Clinton Foundation. In addition to her gig at NBC, Chelsea also serves Vice Chair of the recently renamed “Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation,” where she was “a major force in steering her parents’ charitable work” in the final years of her mother’s time at the State Department.
 
Chelsea also benefits from a job as a board member for Barry Diller’s IAC/InteractiveCorp. Salary for Chelsea: $300,000. The board position also pays an annual retainer of $50,000 and a $250,000 grant of restricted stock.
 
Chelsea, though she only graduated with a master’s degree in 2010, started teaching graduate level classes two years later at Columbia University’s School of Public Health. Her exact salary is unknown. However, the average salary for a Columbia lecturer is $51,671.
 
Chelsea holds another academic post, salary unknown, as assistant vice provost for the Global Network University at New York University.
 
Chelsea has also presented an award to her mother at Diane Von Furstenberg’s International Women’s Day event and hosted her father’s 65th birthday at a Hollywood benefit for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with guests Lady Gaga and Bono.
 
Chelsea’s personal fortune is estimated at $15 million, most earned as a consultant at McKinsey & Company and by working for Avenue Capital Investment Group as a hedge fund manager. Chelsea and her husband live in a $10.5 million condominium in Manhattan.
 
Chelsea is only 34 years old and has already accomplished so much. What a bright future lies ahead! America is still a country where any child can grow up to someday become president.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/secretary-without-honor-philip-jennings/	A Secretary Without Honor by Philip Jennings	Correct Attribution! 				2016/07/20	"Apologists for Hillary Clinton’s alleged criminal mishandling of classified documents say that it doesn’t matter, that she really did nothing wrong, or nothing significant. But the real question is not so much what she did as how she has responded to being found out.
Once during the mid-1960s when I was on active duty in the Marine Corps, I was the air liaison officer for a battalion of Marines aboard 11 ships in the Mediterranean. As the air officer and a senior captain, I had a rotating responsibility for the nuclear code book, kept in the safe in the operations room of the lead amphibious squadron command ship. I shared that duty with another captain, a squared away young man, liked by all he commanded and the son of a very high-ranking Marine.
On the day our ships were leaving the Mediterranean, we met the new amphibious squadron near Gibraltar and made preparations to transfer security codes and other sensitive material to the incoming Marine battalion. The young captain was on duty and went to the operations office to pick up the code book. He was alone in the office. He removed the code book and placed it on the desk while closing the safe. In a rushed moment, he stepped across the passageway to retrieve something he needed from his quarters. Seconds later, he stepped back into the operations office and found the operations sergeant having just entered, looking down at the code book.
Against all regulations, the code book had been out of the safe and unattended. It mattered not that it was unattended for only seconds, that the ship was 5 miles at sea, or that it was certain no one unauthorized had seen the code. The captain could have explained this to the operations sergeant. He could have told the sergeant that he “would take care of it.” He could have hinted that his high-ranking dad could smooth it over.
But the Marine Corps’ values are honor, courage and commitment. Honor is the bedrock of our character. The young captain could not ask the sergeant to betray his duty to report the infraction, no matter how small. Instead, the captain simply said, “Let’s go see the colonel.”
hat captain had wanted to be a Marine officer all of his life. It was the only career he ever wanted. When he reported the incident to the colonel, he knew he was jeopardizing his life’s dream. But he did it.
The results went by the book. The amphibious squadron stood down. Military couriers flew in from NATO. The codes were changed all over Europe. The battalion was a day late in leaving the Mediterranean. The captain, Leonard F. Chapman III, received a letter of reprimand, damaging his career. He stayed in the corps and died in a tragic accident aboard another ship.
I saw some heroic acts in combat in Vietnam, things that made me proud to be an American and a Marine. But that young captain stood for what makes our corps and our country great.
Clinton is the antithesis of that young captain, someone with no honor, little courage and commitment only to her endless ambition. This has nothing to do with gender, party affiliation, ideology or policy. It is a question of character — not just hers, but ours. Electing Clinton would mean abandoning holding people accountable for grievous errors of integrity and responsibility. What we already know about her security infractions should disqualify her for any government position that deals in information critical to mission success, domestic or foreign. But beyond that, her responses to being found out — dismissing its importance, claiming ignorance, blaming others — indict her beyond anything the investigation can reveal. Those elements reveal her character. And the saddest thing is that so many in America seem not to care.
Phillip Jennings is an investment banker and entrepreneur, former Marine Corps pilotin Vietnam and Air America pilot in Laos. He is the author of two novels and one non-fiction book.

It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news video of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Co ntra hearings during the Reagan Administration.
There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning!
He was being drilled by a senator; ‘Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?’
Ollie replied, ‘Yes, I did, Sir.’
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience,
‘Isn’t that just a little excessive?’
‘No, sir,’ continued Ollie.
‘No? And why not?’ the senator asked.
‘Because the lives of my family and I were threatened, sir.’
‘Threatened? By whom?’ the senator questioned.
‘By a terrorist, sir’ Ollie answered.
‘Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?’
‘His name is Osama bin Laden, sir’ Ollie replied.
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn’t pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn’t. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.
‘Why are you so afraid of this man?’ the senator asked.
‘Because, sir, he is the most  evil person alive that I know of ‘
Ollie answered..
‘And what do you recommend we do about him?’ asked the senator.
‘Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.’
The senator disagreed with this approach. And, that was all that was shown of the clip.
By the way, that senator was Al Gore..

https://www.truthorfiction.com/interesting-new-yorker-read-donald-trump/	Interesting New Yorker Story on Donald Trump	Incorrect Attribution! 				2016/08/04	"THE NEW YORKER on Trump
No matter who your favorite candidate might be … the article is an interesting read.
The author is the political correspondent for Bloomberg and wrote extensively about Obama even before he was elected and he did it with facts . This article is a reminder that history shows presidential candidates are often elected based on the state of the union and mood of the people in a particular election cycle. If either Hillary or Bernie is elected, better start preparing for the collapse of America as we know it. The author seems to understand that and is sending a warning.
_____________________________________________________________________________
THE NEW YORKER: Monday, February 1, 2016 11:29 AM, Excellent read. The author is the political correspondent for Bloomberg.
The better question may be, “What is Donald Trump?” The answer: A giant middle finger from average Americans to the political and media establishment.
Some Trump supporters are like the 60s white girls who dated black guys just to annoy their parents. But most Trump supporters have simply had it with the Demosocialists and the “Republicans in Name Only.” They know there isn’t a dime’s worth of difference between Hillary Rodham and Jeb Bush, and only a few cents worth between Rodham and the other GOP candidates. Ben Carson is not an “establishment” candidate, but the Clinton machine would pulverize Carson, and the somewhat rebellious Ted Cruz will (justifiably so) be tied up with natural born citizen lawsuits (as might Marco Rubio). The Trump supporters figure they may as well have some fun tossing Molotov cocktails at Wall Street and Georgetown while they watch the nation collapse. Besides, lightning might strike, Trump might get elected, and he might actually fix a few things. Stranger things have happened. (The nation elected a Marxist in 2008 and Bruce Jenner now wears designer dresses.)
Millions of conservatives are justifiably furious. They gave the Republicans control of the House in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014 and have seen them govern no differently than Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. Yet those same voters are supposed to trust the GOP in 2016? Why? Trump did not come from out of nowhere. His candidacy was created by the last six years of Republican failures.
No reasonable person can believe that any of the establishment candidates will slash federal spending, rein in the Federal Reserve, cut burdensome business regulations, reform the tax code, or eliminate useless federal departments (the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Energy, etc.). Even Ronald Reagan was unable to eliminate the Department of Education. (Of course, getting shot at tends to make a person less of a risk-taker.) No reasonable person can believe that any of the nation’s major problems will be solved by Rodham, Bush, and the other dishers of donkey fazoo now eagerly eating corn in Iowa and pancakes in New Hampshire.
Many Americans, and especially Trump supporters, have had it with:

https://www.truthorfiction.com/veteran-chris-mark-wrote-open-letter-khizr-khan/	Veteran Chris Mark Wrote an Open Letter to Khizr Khan	Authorship Confirmed!				2016/08/04	"Dear Mr. Khan,
I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your son’s sacrifice for this great nation.  By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.
As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger.  The United States has a military comprised of volunteers.  Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve.  There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.  It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights.  I found your comments troubling when you said: “Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”
Does it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed “…nothing and no one?”…has Ms. Clinton “..sacrificed” for this nation?  How about Mr. Obama?   Your comment stating that Mr. Trump “…has sacrifice no one” is alarming.  Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed?  Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself.   As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own.  He was not forced to serve.
I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump.  Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient  Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers?  Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful.  The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements.  One vote is as valuable as another.  That sir, is why our Country is great.  Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.
To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that ‘all Muslims’ should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ” “Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,”The irony of your son’s own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored.  I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people.  In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car.  Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect “his people”…’his soldiers’….’his fellow Americans’…
As you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your son’s own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.
Respectfully,
Chris Mark
US Marine and Navy Veteran.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/mother-active-duty-soldier-destroys-khizr-khan-open-letter/	Mother of ActiveDutySoldier Destroys Khizr Khan in Open Letter	Unproven!				2016/08/04	"To the Muslim Gold Star father that spoke at the DNC…..I have some thoughts on your comments. I am a Blue Star mother. My deepest condolences on the loss of your son. No family should have to endure such a loss. That being said….while your son is a hero, you Sir, are NOT. My son has served three tours of combat in the countries you and your family came from. Iraq and Afghanistan were his introduction to adulthood and service to something bigger than our individual selves. He was blown up by an IED set by your countrymen. His Purple Heart is a testament to his love of America and our freedoms. I have suffered through his multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan….never knowing from moment to moment if he would return home in a flag draped coffin. It is torture when a mother wakes up to this day after day and sees the atrocities happening over there on the news and being helpless to change a thing. My comments to you will probably offend you. I do not apologize. These things need to be said. Unlike you, I could NEVER use my son’s death as a pawn piece in support of a woman that left “America’s treasure” (Hillarys words) to die unaided in Benghazi. The same woman that says vile things to her military details there to protect her. You, Sir, are supposed to be a witness to your son’s bravery and sacrifice. Instead you stood on a stage and promoted the woman that upholds the very people that killed your son. You became a political PAWN that promotes pandering to our enemy. You desecrated your son’s memory by your words. You did not utter one word of outrage at anyone but Donald Trump. Are you forgetting that Trump did not kill your son. He had nothing whatsoever to do with these wars. His memory should mean more to you than five minutes of fame on the stage of the party that voted to send your son to war. The same party that for eight years has denied and cheated our veterans out of their deserved medical care. Who for the last three years has cut our veterans pay.
Of note…your wife stood SILENT. She stood with her head covered, never uttering a word about her loss. She submitted to you being her voice in front of the country. She abdicated her free voice to you…..as would any good Sharia wife and mother. Let me say, this was not lost on the other American military moms….myself included. Had it been my son being “used” as a political PROP, no one could have silenced me. I would be voicing my grief, my pride, my love of him to the world. A man cannot speak to a mothers loss. No man knows her heart at the loss of a child. She did her heroic son a disservice by her silence. She should have uncovered her head and her heart to be the American mother you claim. And last if all….you dared to flash your picket Constitution and ask if Trump has read it. I dare to ask you, Sir….HAVE YOU READ IT? If you say yes, then I dare ask you HOW you could represent that party? HOW can you support this woman? How can you affiliate your family with a party and candidate that cannot even call the radicals that killed your son what they are? How can you support a current administration that diminishes your son’s death by denying he had an enemy? And if you have read our Constitution, how could you cover your soulmate in colorful submissive sheets and have the audacity to speak FOR her? Your son died for that Constitution you so carelessly waved around on national TV in support of the very party that exists to destroy it. As a soldier’s mother….NO ONE could ever speak for me. I find your outrage artificial. I find your party affiliation offensive. I find your wife’s silence atrocious and offensive. I find YOU a political FOOL. I find your son to have been your greatest accomplishment, and you, Sir, have dishonored him. I hope you memorize that picket constitution so you will understand what it means to be a REAL American and hero. You are not one. You were USED. Your son WOULD NOT be proud of you. My only hope is that when MY son goes a fourth time to combat radical Islamic terrorist’s, ( and he WILL) he will know that his mother never stood submissively SILENT about an American hero. Yes, your son was a hero that could not be manipulated but, you, Sir, are a weak minded FOOL. I would love to hear your thoughts this morning about the 1500 American soldiers on the air base in Turkey being held as basic hostages as I type. Not a word from this president or party you adore…or the media that so thoroughly manipulated and used you and your wife. So…what say you Sir??? What will you say to a Blue and Gold Star family if these heroes die? In my opinion, you will say NOTHING.T

One more lie! FROM A FB FRIEND: NOT JUST CHELSEA’S APT – – – BUT A SECRET HOSPITAL?
BREAKING BREAKING BREAKING!!!
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any weirder. YES IT CAN! READ ON!
WTH? Chelsea’s Apt. Has Same Address as a Medical Facility!–Hillary’s Secret Hospital?
A Presidential candidate collapses at a ceremony in NYC…and is shoved, unconscious, by SS into a van like a side of beef and rushed off…not to one of the many world-class hospitals and clinics nearby…but to her daughter’s $11M apartment.
Sound odd? It did to me.
So I looked up a bit about Chelsea’s new apt.:
THE WHITMAN, 21 EAST 26TH STREET, 4 – FLATIRON DISTRICT, NEW YORK
I discovered that it exactly shares an address with:
METROCARE HOME SERVICES, INC.
21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl
New York, NY 10010
Note: This facility is closed or has merged with another facility. Information here is maintained for historical purposes only.
SAME address..SAME Floor…only One Apt. per floor.
For a woman very secretive about her ambiguous medical conditions…whom avoids hospitals like the plague, it occurred to me that when the Clinton’s bought this incredibly expensive apt. for their daughter in 2013…they may have also purchased it with the intent of using it as a secret private medical treatment facility for Hillary to use during her anticipated campaign.
To the press…it would only appear Hillary was just dropping in for a visit with her daughter…when, in reality, she is receiving medical treatment and controlled substances from private physicians and private pharmacists…on private property (no need for disclosure).
If so, Chelsea’s apt. served it’s secret purpose flawlessly this Sunday.
It makes sense that to establish a clandestine medical treatment facility in a residential apartment–one which is legally compliant with the controlled substances dispensing/stocking/delivery & shipping requirements…and one which is able to legally supply and treat a private patient with the drugs needed, one would also have to register the address as a medical treatment facility.
In this case, I would assume the Clinton Foundation would be the controlling entity.
A staff (and private) doctor or pharmacist would then be employed (Hillary has two) to legally treat the patient, practice medicine within the confines of the private residence…and dispense drugs to that private patient without any disclosure.
This sham medical facility, while legally registered as a public care facility…would also have to be closed to the public in order to operate without any disclosure.
THIS is exactly what appears to be taking place at 21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl., New York, NY.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hugh-galyean-open-letter-james-comey/	Hugh Galyean Open Letter to James Comey	 Investigation Pending!	['2016 election', 'criminal justice', 'hillary clinton']			2016/10/13	"Letter to FBI Director Comey from former FBI agent
Wow….this is a great letter from a retired FBI agent….please read.
September 2, 2016 Mr. James Comey, Director Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover Building 935 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W Washington, D.C. 20535-0001
Sir, I am writing regarding your public statement in July, 2016 informing the American people that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton was being closed without referring it to a Federal Grand Jury or the Attorney General of the U. S. for a decision whether or not to indict her.
Strangely, you eloquently laid out enough of the evidence deduced from the investigation to strongly indicate there was abundant evidence uncovered during the investigation and interview of her to not only indict but to convict her in Federal Court.­­­­­­­ ­­­­­­However, you personally re-worded and soft-pedaled the actions she took as Secretary of State describing her actions as “extremely careless” in using a personal email and un-secured server for her communications while Secretary of State. You rewrote the statute, which is not your job.
As a retired Special Agent of the FBI, I have standing to write this letter. My thirty years in law enforcement, including 22 years as a Special Agent with the FBI have given me the knowledge, expertise and experience to question and confront you for your perplexing actions, which (as you well know) were outside the normal standard operating procedure of the FBI and Federal judicial procedures. Some of the finest people in the world proudly carry the credentials of FBI Agent and you have soiled them and not allowed them to speak. But I will not be silent.
Sorry, but NO SIR, MS Clinton was not merely careless or extremely careless. She was not even negligent or grossly negligent (as the statute requires). Hillary Clinton was knowingly purposeful in her decisions and actions to set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control what information was available to the American public and Congress regarding her actions as Secretary of State. Furthermore, she took those government owned communications into her personal possession after leaving her position and knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them so her nefarious actions could never be known or used as evidence of her corrupt moral character against her. Sir, what possessed you? Did you cave in to political pressure to unilaterally come to this decision? I fear that is the case, and Rule of Law be damned. I am embarrassed for and ashamed of you. You have set a precedent that can never be rectified….and certainly not justified. Shame on you, Sir. You ought to resign right now in disgrace for what you have done to tarnish the reputation of the finest Law Enforcement Agency in the world…. for entirely political reasons.
Normally, an investigation will be assigned to an agent, or team of agents with one being the Case agent, or the lead investigator. When the investigation is complete, an investigative report will be presented to the U.S. Attorney for the Federal District involved. It would be the U.S. Attorney who decides whether to decline prosecution for that investigation….NOT the FBI agent.
But in the Clinton investigation, YOU (unilaterally) decided not to forward the investigation to the U.S. Attorney or the Attorney General of the U.S. but, instead, personally made the decision not to prosecute her or even provide the information to a Federal Grand Jury. You were wrong to take this upon yourself. Sir, in order to indict a subject, only a preponderance of evidence , or 51% is needed for probable cause to exist. You did not think even that level of probability existed? Who do you think you are fooling? What judicial proceeding did you think you were following?
Throughout my years with the FBI, I (along with my fellow agents) took great pride in conducting each investigation in an unbiased manner regardless of the subject’s position or standing in the community. All were treated equally under the law. But you, Sir, decided to allow this corrupt, evil and nasty human being to go free and unchallenged for her treasonous actions (yes, treasonous, in my opinion) which threatened the security of this nation. Furthermore, you stopped short of investigating the Clinton Foundation as a RICO case (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization. This is a RICO case if there ever was one. Even an untrained person can tell from the communications which were recovered that Hillary Clinton spent more time working for the Clinton Foundation while Secretary of State than on State Business. It may be argued that Hillary did not do any State business UNLESS the Clinton Foundation benefitted. You decided to just let this uncomfortable truth alone without addressing it.
I will conclude with this: 
Following my retirement from the FBI, I volunteered for a 12 month tour of duty in Afghanistan as a Law Enforcement Professional, embedded with U.S. forces as a subject matter expert in counter-terrorism investigations. 
For most of that year I operated “outside the wire” patrolling with the troops, interviewing witnesses to IED incidents and gathering evidence on the bad guys. The results of my work would then be reported through secure channels to the Commanding Officer. All reports and communications were required to be transmitted via secure and encrypted devices. Occasionally my remote location in the mountains of Afghanistan made transmission impossible and I would have to fly back to Bagram Air Base in order to securely report to the Commander of the battle space. It would have been convenient if I could have just called the Commander on my personal cell phone or written him an email on my personal laptop. But, had I done so I would have been reporting classified information via an unsecured device and it could have been compromised. These were, relative to Secretary of State communications, low level classifications of Secret. Had I ever sent even one in such a manner I would have been prosecuted and sent to Federal Prison for 20 years or so. That is how serious this violation is considered.
Now, because of you, Hillary Clinton is allowed to continue her RICO activities and is running for President of the United States, the most powerful position in the world. You have trampled on the Rule of Law and destroyed the trust of the American people in the FBI and in unbiased enforcement of the law. How do you sleep at night? It is time for you to go and work for the Clinton Foundation. 
Sincerely,
Hugh W. Galyean 
(FBI Agent, Retired)

By: Dr. James Dobson
Is Trump good for America?
I mentioned Sunday that I would speak on this next week. Unfortunately, I found that I was shoehorning this topic into my planned message. To properly present what I want to speak on Sunday, I may have to leave the Donald out of it! But let me take a minute for those that wonder and give some of my thoughts.
When I first heard that Trump (DT) was entering the race last year, I told my wife that perhaps it was a good thing for the party and America. I knew that he was not a “saint,” but I thought that he would be like a bull in a china shop. He is a disrupter and I believe America could use a fresh thinker especially in the political arena. I didn’t think he would get the nomination, but that he would shake up politics as usual. I was correct on the shaking up!
Lance Wallnau likens him to a biblical Cyrus. Someone who is dynamically used of God even though not perceived by many as a God follower. God has used many people in history that I would probably not like or agree with. I’m not sure I would have liked all the disciples, or David, or Moses. Somehow, God did not seem compelled to consult with me on His choices!
I have always admired Winston Churchill. He is seen as one of the greatest national leaders in the 20th century. Last year, I had the privilege of going through the War Museum in London. Winston is a key feature. His life is controversial. He was not always celebrated as a great leader. He was a bombastic, cigar smoking, at times crude, even misogynistic leader. It is alleged that he told off color stories to his children before bedtime! A woman once told him he was disgustingly drunk. His response was “My dear, you are disgustingly ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly!”
There are many websites that discuss the outlandish comments and activities of this great world leader. But, he had exactly what was needed to stop Hitler at the Channel, to rouse a nation to never give up and to partner with America to find final victory in Europe. You probably wouldn’t want him as your pastor, maybe not even your father, but he was the right leader for that moment in England’s history. Such a brazen man that would go up to the roof of his quarters in central London and smoke cigars as Hitler’s air force bombed all around him. I’m not sure I would have voted for him…. but he was the right man!
I think it would be awesome to have a righteous leader, one that understood the intricacies of the economy, health care, defense, immigration, with great sensitivity to religious institutions, a heart for the poor, a vision for the future. If that leader was a praying person, formidable in the word of God and loved the local church, I would rejoice! I do not think that is the choice we will have in November.
Instead….we will look for someone who is imperfect, yet will fit the times we are living in. Particularly, that ‘whoever’ we vote for, will be someone who might possibly have the opportunity to appoint up to three Supreme Court justices. That could radically shape our culture in America for the next 30 years. The America of our grandchildren could be very different….and that may not be good. We cannot stand on the sidelines. A non-vote is a passive vote for a direction we may very well regret.
So…is Donald Trump good for America? I honestly believe that he has been already. He has shaken the political system. Do his comments offend me? At times! Do I agree with all he says? Not at all! But could he be a “Cyrus” being raised up by God to preserve America? Nobody liked Gen. Patton, but he sure WAS an instrument of the United States for the right things.
This I know. I will vote for the best chance for America. I will pray for our leaders as I have already. In the end – God will continue to be my source and my hope. I do believe that God has had a hand in America’s history. I hope and pray that He will also have a saving hand in America’s future.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/buffet-rule/	Email Calls for The Buffet Rule to Fix Congress	Mostly Fiction! 	['congress', 'government waste']			2016/11/22	"Warren Buffett, “I could end the deficit in 5 minutes,” he told CNBC. “You just pass a law that says that anytime there is a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election. The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18 year-olds) took only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified! Why? Simple! The people demanded it. That was in 1971…before computers, e-mail, cell phones, etc. Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution, seven (7) took 1 year or less to become the law of the land…all because of public pressure.
Warren Buffet [sic] is asking each addressee to forward this email to a minimum of twenty people on their address list; in turn ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in The United States of America will have the message. This is one idea that really should be passed around.
*Congressional Reform Act of 2011*
1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are out of office.
2. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. It may not be used for any other purpose.
3. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.
4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.
5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people.
6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people.
7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 1/1/12. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen. Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term’s [sic], then go home and back to work.
If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only take three days for most people (in the U.S.) to receive the message. Maybe it is time.
THIS IS HOW YOU FIX CONGRESS!!!!! If you agree with the above, pass it on.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ben-carson-muslims-email/	"Summary of eRumor:
Ben Carson wrote an essay on Muslims titled “Can a Muslim Be a Good American?” in which he argues that it would be impossible for someone to be a good Muslim and a good American .
The Truth:
The Ben Carson on Muslims email has been circulating since at least 2001, well before Ben Carson entered politics or became a public personality, and the original author of the essay is unknown.
The earliest version of the so"	called Ben Carson on Muslims essay we could find appeared at website that strives to provide “financial hope” to its members in late 2001. Even the earliest versions of the Ben Carson on Muslims essay don’t list an author. But this early version included a few introductory paragraphs that indicate the essay had been in circulation via email well before it was posted online in September 2001:	['gop', 'islam', 'patriotism']			2017/02/10	"Can a good Muslim be a good American?
This question was forwarded to a friend who worked in Saudi Arabia for 20 years.
The following is his reply:
Theologically – no. . . . Because his allegiance is to Allah, The moon god of Arabia.
Religiously – no. . . . Because no other religion is accepted by His Allah except Islam (Quran, 2:256) (Koran)
Scripturally – no. . . . Because his allegiance is to the five Pillars of Islam and the Quran (Koran).
Geographically – no. . . . Because his allegiance is to Mecca, to which he turns in prayer five times a day.
Socially – no. . . . Because his allegiance to Islam forbids him to make friends with Christians or Jews.
Politically – no. . . . Because he must submit to the mullahs (spiritual leaders), who teach annihilation of Israel and destruction of America, the great Satan.
Domestically – no. . . . Because he is instructed to marry four women and beat and scourge his wife when she disobeys him (Quran 4:34)
Intellectually – no. . . . Because he cannot accept the American Constitution since it is based on Biblical principles and he believes the Bible to be corrupt.
Philosophically – no. . . . Because Islam, Muhammad, and the Quran do not allow freedom of religion and expression. Democracy and Islam cannot co-exist. Every Muslim government is either dictatorial or autocratic.
Spiritually – no. . . . Because when we declare ‘one nation under God,’ the Christian’s God is loving and kind, while Allah is NEVER referred to as Heavenly father, nor is he ever called love in The Quran’s 99 excellent names.
Therefore after much study and deliberation … perhaps we should be very suspicious of ALL MUSLIMS in this country. They obviously cannot be both ‘good’ Muslims and ‘good’ Americans.
Call it what you wish . . . it’s still the truth.
You had better believe it.
The more who understand this, the better it will be for our country and our future. The religious war is bigger than we know or understand …B

['foreign leaders', 'national security', 'terrorism']			2017/02/08	"A unique way to handle the release of terrorist and it doesn’t impact the cost to any U.S. Citizen to house them in our prisons stateside. I wonder which one of the “Progressive Democrats” will be first in line for the opportunity?
The Canadians sure know how to handle complaints!
A Canadian female liberal wrote a lot of letters to the Canadian government, complaining about the treatment of captive insurgents (terrorists) being held in Afghanistan National Correctional System facilities. She demanded a response to her letter. She received back the following reply:
National Defense Headquarters
M Gen George R. Pearkes Bldg., 15 NT
101 Colonel By Drive
Ottawa , ON K1A 0K2
Canada
Dear Concerned Citizen
Thank you for your recent letter expressing your profound concern of treatment of the Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists captured by Canadian Forces, who were subsequently transferred to the Afghanistan Government and are currently being held by Afghan officials in Afghanistan National Correctional System facilities.
Our administration takes these matters seriously and your opinions were heard loud and clear here in Ottawa. You will be pleased to learn, thanks to the concerns of citizens like yourself, we are creating a new department here at the Department of National Defense, to be called ‘Liberals Accept Responsibility for Killers’ program, or L.A.R.K. for short.
In accordance with the guidelines of this new program, we have decided, on a trial basis, to divert several terrorists and place them in homes of concerned citizens such as yourself, around the country, under those citizens personal care.
Your personal detainee has been selected and is scheduled for transportation under heavily armed guard to your residence in Toronto next Monday.
Ali Mohammed Ahmed bin Mahmud is your detainee, and is to be cared for pursuant to the standards you personally demanded in your letter of complaint. You will be pleased to know that we will conduct weekly inspections to ensure that your standards of care for Ahmed are commensurate with your recommendations.
Although Ahmed is a sociopath and extremely violent, we hope that your sensitivity to what you described as his ‘attitudinal problem’ will help him overcome those character flaws. Perhaps you are correct in describing these problems as mere cultural differences. We understand that you plan to offer counselling and home schooling, however, we strongly recommend that you hire some assistant caretakers.
Please advise any Jewish friends, neighbours or relatives about your house guest, as he might get agitated or even violent, but we are sure you can reason with him. He is also expert at making a wide variety of explosive devices from common household products, so you may wish to keep those items locked up, unless in your opinion, this might offend him.
Your adopted terrorist is extremely proficient in hand-to-hand combat and can extinguish human life with such simple items as a pencil or nail clippers. We advise that you do not ask him to demonstrate these skills either in your home or wherever you choose to take him while helping him adjust to life in our country.
Ahmed will not wish to interact with you or your daughters except sexually, since he views females as a form of property, thereby having no rights, including refusal of his sexual demands. This is a particularly sensitive subject for him.
You also should know that he has shown violent tendencies around women who fail to comply with the dress code that he will recommend as more appropriate attire. I’m sure you will come to enjoy the anonymity offered by the burka over time. Just remember that it is all part of ‘respecting his culture and religious beliefs’, as described in your letter.
You take good care of Ahmed and remember that we will try to have a counselor available to help you over any difficulties you encounter while Ahmed is adjusting to Canadian culture.
Thanks again for your concern. We truly appreciate it when folks like you keep us informed of the proper way to do our job and care for our fellow man. Good luck and God bless you.
Cordially

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dropping-hammer-comey/	"Summary of eRumor:
A commentary titled “Dropping the Hammer on Comey” has appeared in forwarded emails and on social media.
The Truth:
The widely circulated “Dropping the Hammer on Comey” commentary describes former FBI Director James Comey as “a poisonous snake of the highest order” and paints Comey’s career as one marred by coverups, corruption and collusion with the Clinton Foundation.
It’s not clear exactly where this commentary originated. It was widely circulated on social media in the days and weeks after President Donald Trump fired Comey in May 2017. We weren’t able to verify the original author of the post, but a lengthy version that appeared at the selfdescribed “alternative news media” website StateoftheNation2012.com has been widely circulated.
The site introduces the commentary as “an excellent comment on Facebook.” A woman named Lisa Frank is identified as the author at the bottom of the piece. We weren’t able to track down the original post, or it’s author.
The commentary begins by stating that James Comey has been “highly paid to deliberately provide cover for highlevel corruption by the Clintons and Obama.” Of course, the fact that Hillary Clinton blamed her election loss on Comey’s decision to write a letter informing Congress that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server in October 2016 would appear to contradict the commentary’s claims.
And we previously investigated claims that James Comey had financial ties to the Clinton Foundation, which resurface later on in this commentary, and found them to be unproven. Although it’s true that Comey worked for Lockheed"	"Martin and HSBC bank, two businesses that have ties to the Clinton foundation, there are no direct links between Comey himself and the Clinton Foundation.
Given that this writing expresses the author’s personal views of James Comey and his career, we’re classifying it as “commentary.”
 
 "	['clinton foundation', 'fbi', 'hillary clinton', 'james comey']			2017/05/23	"There are very few crime/mystery novels that approach this true story for compelling drama, intrigue and brinkmanship (with the nation in the balance).
Don’t believe the fake-media story that Trump made a mistake or huge gaffe by firing Comey.
Don’t believe the media narrative from the left that it was an attempt to silence Comey from some investigation into Trump.
Don’t believe the RINO narrative that Comey is a good guy just trying to do his job in terrible circumstances and the timing was bad.
Don’t believe the lie that Comey was admired and respected by career FBI investigators and agents.
Don’t believe the lie that Trump’s “tweets” are not professional and have no strategic purpose. His tweets are weaponized and deadly.
James Comey is a poisonous snake of the highest order… a deep-water Swamp Denizen who has been highly paid to deliberately provide cover for high-level corruption by the Clintons and Obama. He is has been central to trying to destroy the Trump campaign and then the Trump administration from the start. He is as dirty as they come in DC. He had highest-level cover (the FBI no less) and was deep into an effort to eliminate Trump. Trump had to move hard, fast, and at exactly the right time to cut the head off the snake without getting bitten by the snake or being finished by the other swamp denizens.
Begin by noticing how the President fired Comey when Comey was 3,000 miles away from his office, that Comey had no inkling he was being cut, that all his files, computers, and everything in his office were seized by his boss Sessions and the justice department. This was not a violation of protocol, it was tactical. Notice how Prez Trump compartmentalized the strike and did not inform any of his White House “staff” to prevent leaks. Notice how he emasculated Comey and the swamp denizens by letting them know in a tweet that the Attorney General got information (surveillance “tapes” from the seizure of Comey’s office) to let Comey and his handlers know that Trump’s DOJ has the goods on them. This was a brilliant, strategic and totally imperative move at exactly the right time against horrible, evil and corrupt powers infesting our government.
The swamp is on notice that the President is on to them, they are sweating bullets because their criminal games of corruption are being pursued and they know it. They are screaming and ranting because they are desperate denizens of the swamp who are beginning to realize they are roadkill.
THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE COMEY SCAM. Taken from credible public sources (readily available if you want to look or want me to sent them to you), with a few reasonable “fill in the blank” conclusions of my own.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/americans-no-abilities-act-anna/	"Summary of eRumor:
Senate Democrats have introduced a bill called the Americans with No Abilities Act, or ANNA, to provide benefits to Americans who “lack any real skills or ambition.”
The Truth:
Claims about the Americans with No Abilities Act, or ANNA, stem from satire published by The Onion in 1998. Various versions of the rumor that have cropped up over the last two decades have been mistaken for factual news.
The original article was published by The Onion, a well"	known satirical publication, on June 24, 1998, under the headline, “Congress Passes Americans With No Abilities Act.” The report begins:	['congress', 'dnc', 'government waste', 'satire', 'the clintons']			2017/06/02	"The Americans With No Abilities Act (ANAA).
The Democratic Senate is considering sweeping legislation that will provide new benefits for many more Americans. The Americans With No Abilities Act is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills and ambition.
“Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,” said California Sen. Barbara Boxer. “We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing.”
In a Capitol Hill press conference, Nancy Pelosi pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent).
Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance.
Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability (POI) into middle-management positions, and give a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires.
Finally, the Americans With No Abilities Act contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, “Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?”
“As a non-abled person, I can’t be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,” said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, Mich., due to her inability to remember “righty tighty, lefty loosey”. “This new law should be real good for people like me. I’ll finally have job security.” With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.
.
Said Sen. Dick Durbin, II: “As a senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so.”
This message was approved by Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Maxine (WaWa) Waters & Nancy Pelosi.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/getting-know-real-john-mccain-burma-davis-posey/	"Summary of eRumor:
A commentary titled, “Getting to Know the Real John McCain” by Burma Davis Posey began making the rounds in August 2017 after Senator McCain voted against the GOP’s plan to repeal Obamacare.
The Truth:
The “Getting to Know the Real John McCain” commentary that began making the rounds in forwarded emails in August 2017 contains a combination of verifiable facts and opinions about John McCain’s first marriage to Carol Shepp McCain.
The commentary is largely based on a Daily Mail article that ran in 2008, when John McCain was running for president. The article included rare public comments from McCain’s exwife, Carol Shepp McCain, about the couple’s divorce and about John’s mindset after he returned from Vietnam after spending five and a half years as a prisoner of war.
We couldn’t track down the original “Getting to Know the Real John McCain” commentary, or verify that a woman named Burma Davis Posey was its actual author. But we can look at some of the biographical details included in the commentary.
The commentary’s central theme is that Carol McCain was a loyal wife and mother  and that John selfishly divorced her because of life"	"altering injuries that she sustained in a car accident on Christmas Eve of 1969. Both John and Carol McCain have agreed that their divorce fell apart because of John’s immaturity, but Carol disputes the idea that her accident was the central cause.
For his part, John McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir “Worth Fighting For” that: “My marriage’s collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity. The blame was entirely mine.”
For her part, Carol McCain told the Daily Mail in a 2008: “My accident is well recorded. I had 23 operations, I am five inches shorter than I used to be and I was in hospital for six months. It was just awful, but it wasn’t the reason for my divorce. My marriage ended because John McCain didn’t want to be 40, he wanted to be 25. You know that happens…it just does.”
And the commentary’s claims about John McCain meeting Cindy and beginning a relationship with her before his first marriage ended appears to be true. John claimed in “Worth Fighting For” that his relationship with Cindy didn’t begin until after he separated from Carol, but others dispute that.
A 2008 Los Angeles Times story that quotes a friend of John McCain who was at the reception in Hawaii where John met Cindy said that some people in his social circle believed that the McCains had already separated by the time John and Cindy met based on John’s behavior:"	['2008 election', 'congress', 'john mccain', 'obamacare']			2017/08/10	"By Burma Davis Posey This is John McCain’s homeJPG in Arizona. Not bad for a man who worked in the military, left the military, and then ran for Congress. He has been in Congress since 1983… for 34 years. McCain graduated 894th in his class of 899 students from the Naval Academy. He was known for being wild and it usually revolved around women. He was a member of a group of students who called themselves “The Bad Bunch”. He married Carol Shepp who was a successful swimsuit model. She had been married to one of his classmates and had two children from her first marriage. She and McCain became parents for a daughter one year later. He had been quite a playboy and was already becoming bored with the domesticated life. He requested active duty in Vietnam. While he was there, Carol faithfully stayed at home looking after the children and waiting anxiously for news about her husband. His plane was shot down in 1967 and he became a POW. On Christmas Eve 1969, Carol and the children were spending the holiday with her parents. After dinner she was going to take gifts to some friends. The road was icy and she slid head-on into a telephone pole. She was thrown from the car through the front window. Her legs, spine, and right arm were crushed and she was in the hospital for 6 months. Ross Perot was an advocate of POW’s and he paid her medical bills. She requested that John not be told because she felt he already had enough to deal with. McCain was released in 1973 and returned home to much fanfare. Carol had several surgeries, lost 5 inches in height, and gained some weight.. McCain told reporters he was overjoyed to see Carol again. But friends say privately he was ‘appalled’ by the change in her appearance. As a war hero, McCain was moving in ever-more elevated circles. “He started carousing and running around with women.”, reported Robert Timberg. Bob Timberg was a retired Marine, an American journalist, writer, and author of four books, including THE NIGHTINGALE’S SONG and JOHN MCCAIN: AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY. McCain admitted he started having many girlfriends and affairs during this time. On one trip to Hawaii he met an Anheuser Busch distributer heiress, Cindy Hensley, at a cocktail party. She was 17 years younger than McCain and worth $100 million dollars. He invited her to have drinks with him at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. He said by the end of the evening he was in love. They had an affair for nine months while he was still married to and living with his wife Carol. McCain wanted to marry Cindy but needed first to get a divorce. He and Carol separated in January 1980. He requested a divorce in February, the divorce was sped along and granted in April. He and Cindy married 5 weeks after the divorce was final on May 17, 1980. Carol and their children were devastated. McCain callously left his first wife and children behind. He and Cindy moved to Arizona. Cindy’s father was well-connected and helped McCain move smoothly into Congress representing Arizona in Washington DC. McCain’s new wife and her family were extravagantly wealthy. Her father was one of the largest distributors of Anheuser Busch in the country and she was an only child. The divorce settlement afforded Carol McCain full custody of their three children, alimony, child support, including college tuition, houses in Virginia and Florida, and lifelong financial support for her continuing medical treatment from the car accident. Carol said the reason for the divorce was John turned 40 and he wanted to be 25 again. Carol was extremely hurt. She went to work as the press assistant for soon-to-be First Lady Nancy Reagan. She became loved and respected in Washington. She kept a dignified silence about the horrendous way McCain had treated her. Some of the McCain friends were less forgiving, however. They portray the politician as a self-centred womaniser who effectively abandoned his crippled wife to ‘play the field’. They accuse him of finally settling on Cindy, a former rodeo beauty queen, for financial reasons. Despite his popularity as a politician, there are those who have not forgotten his treatment of his first wife. Ted Sampley, who fought with US Special Forces in Vietnam is now a leading campaigner for veterans’ rights. Ted said, “I have been following John McCain’s career for nearly 20 years. I know him personally. There is something wrong with this guy and let me tell you what it is… deceit. “When he came home and saw that Carol was not the beauty he left behind, he started running around on her almost right away. Everybody around him knew it. Eventually he met Cindy and she was young, beautiful, and very wealthy. McCain just dumped Carol for something he thought was better. “This is a guy who makes such a big deal about his character. Yet he has no character. He is a fake.” Ross Perot, who paid her medical bills all those years ago, now believes that both Carol McCain and the American people have been taken in by a man who is unusually slick and cruel, even by the standards of modern politics. Mr. Perot said, “McCain is the classic opportunist. He’s always reaching for attention and glory. After he came home, Carol walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona. And the rest is history. A man who cannot be faithful to a loving, self-sacrificing wife cannot be trusted to be faithful to the American people. Cindy has also had to learn the lessons about her husband the hard way. Even though she and McCain put on a perfect front for the public, especially when he is running for office, she really is an invisible wife to him. Tom Gosinski, who served as director of Cindy McCain’s nonprofit American Voluntary Medical Team (AVMT) wrote in his journal about the McCain marriage: “During my short tenure at AVMT I have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all-American family. In reality, I am working for a very sad, lonely woman. Her marriage of convenience to a U.S. Senator has driven her to distance herself from friends, cover feelings of despair with drugs, and replace lonely moments with self-indulgences. She became addicted to Percocet and had a doctor prescribing them for her illegally. When her parents learned she was taking them, they helped her stop. Washington rumors were saying McCain had an inappropriate relationship with the young and lovely lobbyist, Vicki Iseman. Ms. Iseman began visiting McCain’s offices and campaign events so frequently in 2000 that his aides were “convinced the relationship had become romantic”. One staff member supposedly asked, “Why is she always around?” His staff members began a campaign to “save McCain from himself” by restricting Iseman’s access to McCain during the course of the 2000 presidential primary. According to the Washington Post, McCain’s political advisor John Weaver met with Iseman at Washington’s Union Station to tell Iseman not to see McCain anymore. It is not a real marriage between John and Cindy McCain. Real marriages usually involve living together. McCain and Cindy have not “lived” together for 20 years. To defend this, McCain brags the family takes two vacations together every year and Ms. McCain is the one who has always made that happen.” Two vacations per year…What a farse and fake!! Nothing about this man is real. He has no compassion or empathy for anyone except himself. The only real thing emotion he is capable of is anger. He is famous for his anger.

Written by Ted Nugent
Take a little trip to Valley Forge in January. Hold a musket ball in your fingers and imagine it piercing your flesh and breaking a bone or two. There won’t be a doctor or trainer to assist you until after the battle, so just wait your turn. Take your cleats and socks off to get a real experience.
Then take a knee.
Then, take a knee on the beach in Normandy where man after American man stormed the beach, even as the one in front of him was shot to pieces … the very sea stained with American blood. The only blockers most had were the dead bodies in front of them, riddled with bullets from enemy fire.
Take a knee in the sweat soaked jungles of Vietnam. From Khe San to Saigon … anywhere will do. Americans died in all those jungles. There was no playbook that told them what was next, but they knew what flag they represented. When they came home, they were protested as well, and spit on for reasons only cowards know.
Take another knee in the blood drenched sands of Fallujah in 110 degree heat .. Wear your Kevlar helmet and battle dress. Your number won’t be printed on it unless your number is up! You’ll need to stay hydrated but there won’t be anyone to squirt Gatorade into your mouth. You’re on your own.
There are a lot of places to take a knee where Americans have given their lives all over the world.. When you use the banner under which they fought as a source for your displeasure, you dishonor the memories of those who bled for the very freedoms you have. That’s what the red stripes mean. It represents the blood of those who spilled a sea of it defending your liberty.
While you’re on your knee, pray for those that came before you, not on a manicured lawn striped and printed with numbers to announce every inch of ground taken … but on nameless hills and bloodied beaches and sweltering forests and bitter cold mountains .. every inch marked by an American life lost serving that flag you protest.
No cheerleaders, no announcers, no coaches, no fans … just American men and women … delivering the real fight against those who chose to harm us … blazing a path so you would have the right to “take a knee.” You haven’t any inkling of what it took to get you where you are … but your “protest” is duly noted. Not only is it disgraceful to a nation of real heroes, it serves the purpose of pointing to your ingratitude for those who chose to defend you under that banner that will still wave long after your jersey is retired.
If you really feel the need to take a knee, come with me to church on Sunday and we’ll both kneel before Almighty God. We’ll thank Him for preserving this country for as long as He has. We’ll beg forgiveness for our ingratitude for all He has provided us. We’ll appeal to Him for understanding and wisdom. We’ll pray for liberty and justice for all…because He is the one who provides those things. But there will be no protest. There will only be gratitude for His provision and a plea for His continued grace and mercy on the land of the free and the home of the brave. It goes like this … GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/lenard-w-wahlert-letter-mcconnell-ryan/	"Summary of eRumor:
A letter written by a man named Lenard W. Wahlert to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (RKY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R"	"WI) about a lack of GOP congressional leadership has been circulating in forwarded emails and social media posts.
The Truth:
A letter taking Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to task for failing to support President Trump and for failing to advance the GOP’s legislative agenda has been correctly attributed to a California man named Lenard W. Wahlert.
Lenard Wahlert does not appear to have public social media accounts, but Wahlert posted the letter to McConnel and Ryan on a discussion board called GaltsGulchOnline.com under the headline, “The Globetrotters & The Washington Generals,” on August 31, 2017. Wahlert describes himself as a Vietnam War veteran and former 3M executive  who is on the verge of leaving the GOP due to a failure of leadership from congressional Republicans:"	['2016 election', 'congress', 'donald trump']			2017/09/28	"Senator Mitch McConnell,
U.S. Senate Majority Leader
317 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510
Representative Paul Ryan,
Speaker of the House,
1233 Longworth HOB
Washington, D..C. 20515
Gentlemen: I’m a 68-year-old Vietnam Vet and retired 3M Executive. I
am on the verge of leaving the Grand Old Party. No big deal for you –
huge deal for me. I have come nearly to the end of my loyalty to a
party that seems to have lost its backbone.
The lack of leadership displayed by the two of you — for
whatever reason you’ve decided to not support or defend the duly
elected President of the United States — is beyond me.
Yes, President Trump is not the typical political
bureaucrat, but he is the President of the United States. It appears
from where I sit that you both have decided to lay down on the job
you’ve been elected to serve. The 60 Million + people that voted this
President into office made this decision based upon the absolute
requirement to have someone outside the beltway to lead the nation. As
distasteful as this appears to be for not only the Democrats, it
appears to be equally distasteful to the GOP leadership. Your lack of
action on numerous legislative issues that this country desperately
needs is visible to all.
The electoral map of the U.S. is RED because President Trump
mobilized the electorate. These same voters are going to clean house
again in 2018 if you don’t start acting like leaders. Former Arizona
state lawmaker Kelli Ward is out in front against Senator Jeff Flake
by 25 percentage points today. Can you say: “We are tired of GOP
leaders in Washington D. C.?” This is only going to increase across
the U. S. for all GOP mid-term candidates if they continue to
demonstrate no backbone and will not support our President.
My best description of where this country is headed was
voiced by David Horowitz. “Friends, this isn’t George Orwell’s “1984.”
It is America, 2017.” |
When I look at the current GOP, I’m struck by a comparison
that I recently heard. This is a basketball example that really does
reflect what the GOP appears to be today. The metaphor is the Harlem
Globetrotters and the Washington Generals. The Democrats are the
Globetrotters and the GOP are proud to be the Washington Generals.
The Generals know going into the game that they are going to lose, but
it’s a nice gig and they get to be on the court with the big boys.
The GOP and The Washington Generals don’t mind losing – they just want
to be in the game! Sound familiar?
That is exactly how it appears to the loyal GOP voters out
here in America right now. Why is zero legislation moving forward? We
have the Presidency, we have the House, we have the Senate! What’s
wrong with this picture? We are wasting valuable time here, Senator
McConnell and Representative Ryan. The voters are not going to waste
time in 2018. This is the last chance for the GOP before it morphs
into something none of us recognizes. And, by the way, when are you
going to support the laws on the books? Sanctuary Cities, Antifa,
tearing down statues, covering statues: the progressives are running
wild and the GOP is laying down.
Remember freedom of speech? UC Berkeley? The
progressives are worried about what shoes the first lady is wearing
and the media is supporting it. What a wonderful world we are living
in. Well, there you have it.
President Trump and Vice President Pence are being copied on
this plea for help. Hitch up your pants and stiffen your backbones.
It’s about time! I know what’s coming because I live in a state that
has already gone off the cliff – CALIFORNIA. The Progressive has already won here!! I mean the Globetrotters. The Golden State has
become the refuge of refuse….millions of ’em.
I have an extensive cc list of over 1,500 people. I’m asking
them to send this note to 10 of their Conservative Friends. We the
people will not sit still while this country is being abused and our
values are not being represented. The Left will not take this country
away from us.
Respectfully,
Lenard W. Wahlert

https://www.truthorfiction.com/snowball/	Snowballthe 87 pound cat from Chalk River, Canada	Fiction!				2015/03/16	"
Rodger Degagne, a former employee with AECL in Chalk River, may be embarking on a new career as Feline Breeder. 
Relaxing in his spacious home on the shores of the Ottawa River, Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs abandoned since the late 50’s. With the help of his tuna sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could pick them up.
A self described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Human Society. In this largely rural area, cats of all stripes and ages largely go unwanted and are humanely disposed of after a few days.
Later that evening his wife Louise and their two children, Nicole and Kelly came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found. Lost turned out to be female and Found a male. When nature finally took it’s course, a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was a big white female with a unique black markings on her side and tail. Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne’s. While Lost and Found are no  longer with us, their progeny live on. In her 9 years Snowball’s size has seemed to snowball.
Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat, she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87Ibs. She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing. She always meowed for more food and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover. Chicken is her favorite. “Once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone”, Louise said.  We knew that snowball wasn’t your average cat when the neighbor’s German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her. She just isn’t afraid of any animals. After we found a half eaten raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep snowball in the yard, we couldn’t keep raccoons from Snowball. At least it kept the food bills down Rodger laughed “Like all female cats she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ole kitten” he said. So what does a 87 pound cat eat? Snowball goes through a about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken, supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall. She likes Pike a lot, so I don’t throw them back any more. Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.
So what do the Degagne’s attribute Snowball’s size to? Rodger says “Well, the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn’t fat, she’s just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn’t have”.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/aldrin-communion/	Lunar Astronaut Buzz Aldrin Celebrated Communion on the Moon	Truth! 				2015/03/17	"A NASA Little Known Fact
The first food and drink consumed on the moon was the reserved sacrament of communion. At first, it was kept secret. To mark the 40th anniversary of the first Apollo moon landing, Bosco Peters has posted the details of this Christian act of worship 235,000 miles from the earth. The First Communion on the Moon is now one of The Episcopal Church’s ‘lesser feasts and fasts’, he writes.
On Sunday July 20, 1969 the first people landed on the moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in the lunar lander which touched down at 3:17 Eastern Standard Time. Buzz Aldrin had with him the Reserved Sacrament. He radioed: “Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM pilot speaking. I would like to request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each person listening in, whoever or wherever he may be, to contemplate for a moment the events of the last few hours, and to give thanks in his own individual way.”
‘Later he wrote: “In the radio blackout, I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit.’ I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute Deke Slayton had requested that I not do this. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare, the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas. I agreed reluctantly…Eagle’s metal body creaked. I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility. It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements.”
‘NASA kept this secret for two decades. The memoirs of Buzz Aldrin and the Tom Hanks’s Emmy-winning HBO mini-series, From the Earth to the Moon (1998), made people aware of this act of Christian worship 235,000 miles from Earth.

This bear was killed on Hitchenbrook Island by an airman stationed at Elmendorf.
The bear measured 12 1/2 feet long and was estimated at over 1600 pounds.
The guy was on his way to his hunting area when the bear stood up only 350 yards away.
It dropped down and charged. The airman emptied his gun and the bear fell 10 yards from him.
Version #2
 Do not view these photos if you get queasy at the sight of blood and bodies.  This is not an “urban legend”.  REAL life, REAL danger, WILD ALASKA.       The photos are of a guy who works for the Forest Service. He was out deer hunting.  A large grizzly bear charged him from about 50 yards away.  He unloaded his 7mm Semi-automatic rifle into the bear and it dropped a few feet from him.  The big bear was still alive so he reloaded and capped it in the head.  The bear was over one thousand six hundred pounds.  It stood 12′ 6″ high at the shoulder, and 14′ to the top of his head. It’s the largest grizzly bear ever recorded in the world.  Of course, the game department did not let him keep it.  It will be mounted and put on display at the Anchorage airport to remind tourists of the risks involved when in the wild.  You would be level with the bear’s belly button when he stood upright.  When on all fours, he would look you in the eye.  To give it additional perspective, consider that this bear, standing on its hind legs, could walk up to an average single story house and look over the roof.  The bear had killed at least two people.  His last meal was the unlucky hiker in the third picture.  The Forest Service found his 38-caliber pistol emptied.  Although the hiker fired six shots, only four managed to hit the bear. (they ultimately found four 38-caliber slugs along with the seven 7mm slugs inside the bear’s dead body) The 38’s only wounded him—and really pissed him off.  The bear killed the hiker an estimated three days prior to the bear’s own demise by the Forest Service worker.

A legend in South Africa and author of 3 books including the bestseller, The Elephant Whisperer.


He bravely rescued wildlife and rehabilitated elephants all over the globe from human atrocities, including the courageous rescue of Baghdad Zoo animals during US invasion in 2003.
On March 7, 2012 Lawrence Anthony died. He is remembered and missed by his wife, 2 sons, 2 grandsons, and numerous elephants.
Two days after his passing, the wild elephants showed up at his home led by two large matriarchs. Separate wild herds arrived in droves to say goodbye to their beloved ‘man-friend.’
A total of 31 elephants had patiently walked over 12 miles to get to his South African House.


Witnessing this spectacle, humans were obviously in awe not only because of the supreme intelligence and precise timing that these elephants sensed about Lawrence’s passing, but also because of the profound memory and emotion the beloved animals evoked in such an
organized way: Walking slowly, for days, making their way in a solemn one-by-one queue from their habitat to his house.
Lawrence’s wife, Francoise, was especially touched, knowing that the elephants had not been to his house prior to that day for well over 3 years! But yet they knew where they were going.
The elephants obviously wanted to pay their deep respects, honouring their friend who’d saved their lives – so much respect that they stayed for 2 days 2 nights without eating anything.
Then one morning, they left, making their long journey back home.

The email and pictures below show what can happen from a Brown Recluse spider bite. This happened to a Campers On Mission friend of ours from Angleton, TX. He was doing volunteer work at Texas Baptist Encampment in Palacios, TX in early January when this happened. He seems to be doing well at this time. So, this is something you need to be aware of…
This guy was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider.

Day 3
The following illustrates the progression of a brown recluse spider bite.
The affected skin actually dies on his body.

Day 5
Some of the pictures towards the end are pretty nasty,  (removed by TruthOrFiction.Com)
but take a look at the last one — it is a picture of the spider itself.
Day 6
The Brown Recluse Spider is the most
dangerous spider that we have here in the USA.
Day 9
A person can die from it’s bite.
We all should know what the spider looks like.
Day 10
Send this around to people you love.
As the weather gets warmer, people will be digging around,
doing yard work, spring cleaning, and sometimes in their attics.

The Dangerous Brown Recluse Spider
Please be careful.
Spider bites are dangerous and can have permanent and highly negative consequences. They like the darkness and tend to live in storage sheds or attics or other areas that might not be frequented by people or light. If you have a need to be in your attic, go up there and turn on a light and leave it on for about 30 minutes before you go in to do your work.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/cfl-bulb-dangers/	Energy Saving Bulb Dangers	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TRAMP ON A BROKEN ENERGY SAVER BULB or FLORESCENT LIGHT BULBS
 
Other Version:
 
By now, we have all seen them.We probably all have some in our homes. We most certainly have come into contact with them in the homes to which we respond.
I am talking about energy-saving light bulbs. They have many different names; compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), compact fluorescent light, and compact fluorescent tube, all describe a fluorescentlamp designed to replace an incandescent lamp. Compared to their incandescent brothers producing the same amount of visible light, CFLs consume less power (from 1/5 to 1/3) and have a longer service life (8 to 15 times).
But the news in our quest to be better stewards of our planet is not all good. These CFLs have a small electronic ballast in their base. There is a fire hazard associated with these ballasts, but that is a conversation for another day. Let’s talk about another danger posed by these “green” lamps: mercury exposure and poisoning.
Like all fluorescent lamps, CFLs contain mercury. This fact not only complicates their disposal under normal conditions, the problem is exacerbated when the lamp is broken and the mercury is allowed “out of its box.” The symptoms of  mercury poisoning typically include sensory impairment (vision, hearing, and speech), a lack of coordination, skin discoloration, tingling, itching, burning or pain, and desquamation (shedding of skin).
 
Mercury in lamps is typically present as either elemental mercury liquid, vapor, or both, since the liquid readily evaporates at room temperature. When broken indoors, lamps may emit sufficient mercury vapor to present health concerns. Breakage of multiple lamps presents a greater concern. Injection of mercury into the body through broken glass that is contaminated is of particular concern.
Here is the scenario:
You are dispatched to The Smith residence for a laceration to the foot. Routine run huh? Nope. What you were not told is that Mr. Smith uses CFL lamps in his home. One of those lamps burned-out, and Mr. Smith did not wait for the lamp to cool down before he stood on a chair and removed it. Because the lamp was hot to the touch, Mr. Smith dropped it. As the lamp hit the floor, it exploded. As Mr. Smith descended from the chair he stepped, barefooted, into the broken glass and exposed mercury.
Here is what Mr. Smith’s foot looked like during his 2-week stay in ICU.


At one stage it was feared that his foot would need to be amputated. Currently his foot is connected to a vacuum pump to remove continuously dead tissue

 
The following are the recommended actions to take in the event of a broken CFL.
? Evacuate the room, taking care not to step on the broken glass littering the floor
?Ventilate the room for a MINIMUM of 15 minutes (EPA recommendation)
?DO NOT clean the debris of the broken lamp with a vacuum cleaner as this will spread toxic mercury droplets throughout the house either immediately or upon the future use of the vacuum.
Don protective gloves (I’ll be the one in SCBA too!); use a broom or brush to sweep the debris into a dustpan; empty the contents of the dustpan into a plastic bag; seal the plastic bag.
?DO NOT dispose of the plastic bag into an ordinary refuse receptacle.
?The debris is lawfully a Hazardous Material and must be disposed of accordingly.
Depending on the severity of the spill, a more thorough clean-up regimen may need to be employed. Private companies exist that specialize in this type of operation.
Mercury is a toxin, and should be treated with the utmost of care and respect. A CFL may look benign, and make you feel good about “going green,” but once the poison is “out of its box” and able to cause an exposure, it’s a brand new deal. Stay Safe folks!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/chp-cuffs-firefighter/	California Highway Patrol Officer Cuffs Montecito Fire Battalion Chief	Truth!				2015/03/17	"From: :Lack of Common Sense

This is so dumb, I still can’t believe it… I am going to send it out the way I got it…meaning that noting has been changed…the story is from a firefighter in Montecito, California…I guess they didn’t issue this Chippie Motor any common sense…he’s probably written his own mother a citation
This is a true story, 15 February 2010 on Highway 101 in Montecito, California.
The Scene…T/C in the center divider, 2 vehicles, 6 patients, 1 known minor injury. I am driving the squad and we follow the fire engine in. We pull past the fire engine then it blocks the lane to provide a safe working area, (per SOP). This is where it becomes interesting.
The CHP officer tells our BC (Battalion Chief) that the engine can’t block the lane because it will cause too much traffic (congestion). Our BC tells him no, that we need it there till we are done. 62 seconds from the time our BC goes on scene, we hear our BC on the radio asking our dispatcher for a CHP supervisor to be sent to the scene. Next thing I know and I look over and the CHP officer is handcuffing/arresting our BC. Note that the fire engine personnel haven’t even made patient contact yet! This is where the CHP officer goes to our Captain and tells him the same thing….. “Move the engine or I am going to arrest you and the Engineer. Then he called for a Heavy Tow truck to tow our fire engine off the freeway! The Captain finally gave in as our dispatcher warned him that the Heavy had been dispatched
After that the CHP officers supervisor showed up and un-cuffed our BC. The original arresting officer then went back over to our BC and gave him an “obstructing a police officer with an investigation ticket.” He must have felt strongly that he was right. Turns out the CHP officer just transferred from Bakersfield to here less than 2 weeks ago.
The picture is our BC sitting handcuffed against the center guardrail. The cop actually asked him “Do I need to chain you to my motorcycle to make sure you don’t go anywhere?”
Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Deputies stopped by tonight with 2 cakes. One had a file in it. The CHP Night watch Sergeant came over too and couldn’t apologize enough.
The ticket still stands and we haven’t heard what is up with the CHP officer, but he never backed down. It seemed like he never felt like he did anything wrong.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/chinese-sub-catalina/	Chinese Submarine Launched Missile Off California Coast	Unproven!				2015/03/17	"Subject: Pentagon and its embedded media covering up Chinese show of force off LA
November 10, 2010 — Pentagon and its embedded media covering up Chinese show of force off LA China flexed its military muscle Monday evening in the skies west of Los Angeles when a Chinese Navy Jin class ballistic missile nuclear submarine, deployed secretly from its underground home base on the south coast of Hainan island, launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from international waters off the southern California coast. WMR’s intelligence sources in Asia, including Japan, say the belief by the military commands in Asia and the intelligence services is that the Chinese decided to demonstrate to the United States its capabilities on the eve of the G-20 Summit in Seoul and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Tokyo, where President Obama is scheduled to attend during his ten-day trip to Asia.
The reported Chinese missile test off Los Angeles came as a double blow to Obama. The day after the missile firing, China’s leading credit rating agency, Dagong Global Credit Rating, downgraded sovereign debt rating of the United States to A-plus from AA. The missile demonstration coupled with the downgrading of the United States financial grade represents a military and financial show of force by Beijing to Washington.
The Pentagon spin machine, backed by the media reporters who regularly cover the Defense Department, as well as officials of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the U.S. Northern Command, is now spinning various conspiracy theories, including describing the missile plume videotaped by KCBS news helicopter cameraman Gil Leyvas at around 5:00 pm Pacific Standard Time, during the height of evening rush hour, as the condensation trail from a jet aircraft. Other Pentagon-inspired cover stories are that the missile was actually an amateur rocket or an optical illusion.

Experts agree that this was a ballistic missile being fired off of Los Angeles. Pentagon insists it was a jet aircraft or model rocket.
There are no records of a plane in the area having taken off from Los Angeles International Airport or from other airports in the region. The Navy and Air Force have said that they were not conducting any missile tests from submarines, ships, or Vandenberg Air Force Base. The Navy has also ruled out an accidental firing from one of its own submarines.
Missile experts, including those from Jane’s in London, say the plume was definitely from a missile, possibly launched from a submarine. WMR has learned that the missile was likely a JL-2 ICBM, which has a range of 7,000 miles, and was fired in a northwesterly direction over the Pacific and away from U.S. territory from a Jin class submarine. The Jin class can carry up to twelve such missiles.
Navy sources have revealed that the missile may have impacted on Chinese territory and that the National Security Agency (NSA) likely posseses intercepts of Chinese telemtry signals during the missile firing and subsequent testing operations.



Japanese and other Asian intelligence agencies believe that a Chinese Jin-class SSBN submarine conducted missile “show of force” in skies west of Los Angeles.
Asian intelligence sources believe the submarine transited from its base on Hainan through South Pacific waters, where U.S. anti-submarine warfare detection capabilities are not as effective as they are in the northern and mid-Pacific, and then transited north to waters off of Los Angeles. The Pentagon, which has spent billions on ballistic missile defense systems, a pet project of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, is clearly embarrassed over the Chinese show of strength.

Likely route of Jin-class submarine from Hainan base.
The White House also wants to donwplay the missile story before Presidnet Obama meets with his Chinese counterpart in Seoul and Tokyo. According to Japanese intelligence sources, Beijing has been angry over United States and allied naval exercises in the South China and Yellow Seas, in what China considers its sphere of influence, and the missile firing within the view of people in Southern California was a demonstration that China’s navy can also play in waters off the American coast.
For the U.S. Navy, the Chinese show of force is a huge embarassment, especially for the Navy’s Pacific Command in Pearl Harbor, where Japan’s December 7, 1941 attack on the fleet at Pearl Harbor remains a sore subject.
In 2002, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice reportedly scolded visiting Chinese General Xiong Guankai, the deputy chief of staff for intelligence of the People’s Liberation Army, for remarks he allegedly made in 1995 that China would use nuclear weapons on Los Angeles. Xiong denied he made any such comments but the “spin” on the story helped convince Congress to sink billions of additional dollars into ballistic missile defense, sometimes referred to at “Star Wars II.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/cannabis-cancer/	Cannabis Oil Cures Cancer	Unproven!				2015/03/17	"Cannabis Cures Cancer 
 
The US Government has known since 1974 that Cannabis cures Cancer. In ’72 Richard Nixon wanted a larger budget for his war on drugs. He thought that if he proved Cannabis caused lung cancer like cigarettes do, he would get the support he needed. He gave the Medical College of Virginia 2 years to do a study on the effects of THC on the body. In ’74 the study was completed. It turns out, THC when ingested in highly concentrated forms (such as eating Cannabis oil) will attack any mutated cells in your body while strengthening and rejuvenating the healthy cells. They found the PERFECT cure for Cancer. It worked fast, it worked well, it worked on many different forms of Cancer in ALL stages and it had ZERO harmful side effects. (Unlike Chemo which deteriorates your entire body and kills 1 in 5 patients. Not only that, but it dissolves ALL forms of tumors and can even combat super-bugs like MRSA.) When Richard Nixon saw the results of the study he was FURIOUS. He threw the entire report in the trash and deemed the study classified. In 1976 President Gerald Ford put an end to all public cannabis research and granted exclusive research rights to major pharmaceutical companies, who set out — unsuccessfully — to develop synthetic forms of THC that would deliver all the medical benefits without the “high.”
We only found out about the study a few years ago thanks to dedicated medical and law professionals who filed Freedom of Information Requests. The Govt lied for many reasons.. One of the main reasons is Pharmaceutical Companies. They spend billions every year lobbying to keep Cannabis illegal because they make TRILLIONS off Cancer drugs and research. They are already well aware that Cannabis cures Cancer. They have a great con going at the moment. Cancer patients and their loved ones will spend their entire life savings or even sell their houses and businesses in order to pay for Chemotherapy and other Cancer treatment drugs. A lot of the time they spend all that money and their loved one dies anyway. If the public found out that the Government has been lying for over 40 years, that MILLIONS of lives could have been saved and that the dying could grow the cure they need in their backyard… The Public would be going APE-SHIT.
PLEASE keep an open mind about this. I realize it’s hard to believe but I PROMISE YOU, it’s true. If you want to know more, you should Google ‘Cannabis Cures Cancer’. You will see that there are thousands of published scientific studies, articles, books and documentaries on the subject. Id start with the film ‘Run From The Cure’. Its one of my favorites
(Comment from the admin): I feel the need to be EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR here because many people have attacked me for sharing this information. SMOKING CANNABIS DOES NOT CURE CANCER. EATING CANNABIS OIL DOES. There have been A LOT of skeptics about this. I highly suggest you actually RESEARCH THIS SUBJECT rather than demonize the people that have already actually researched it. Cannabis DOES CURE CANCER… This is not a rumor, this is not some internet hoax.. THIS IS A FACT. Every single person I know that’s tried this cure, has successfully cured their cancer. Do you get what I’m saying? I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF IT WEREN’T FOR THIS CURE. Plenty of people have posted proof online. Check before you doubt!!

In the latest example of potentially harmful Chinese-made products, rubber hair bands have been found in local markets and beauty salons in Dongguan and Guangzhou cities in southern Guangdong province, China Daily newspaper said.
‘These cheap and colorful rubber bands and hair ties sell well ….. threatening the health of local people,’ it said.
Despite being recycled, the hair bands could still contain bacteria and viruses, it said.
‘People could be infected with AIDS, (genital) warts or other diseases if they hold the rubber bands or strings in their mouths while waving their hair into plaits or buns,’ the paper quoted a local dermatologist who gave only his surname, Dong, as saying. A bag of ten of the recycled bands sells for just 25 s en (three cents), much cheaper than others on the market, accounting for their popularity, the paper said.
A government official was quoted as saying recycling condoms was illegal. China ‘s manufacturing industry has been repeatedly tarnished this year by a string of scandals involving shoddy or dangerous goods made for both domestic and foreign markets.
In response, it launched a public relations blitz this summer aimed at playing up efforts to strengthen monitoring systems.

The girl, Maria Sue, was hit in the driveway of the family’s home Wednesday afternoon by a Toyota Land Cruiser driven by her teenage brother, said Laura McPherson, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
The brother, whose name and exact age weren’t available, apparently did not see the girl, McPherson said. No charges are expected.
“It looks like a tragic accident,” she said.
Several family members witnessed the accident, which happened in Williamson County just south of Nashville. The girl died later at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, hospital spokeswoman Laurie Holloway said.
In a statement, Velvet Kelm, a publicist for Chapman, said Maria was the Chapmans’ youngest daughter.
Chapman, who is originally from Paducah, Ky., and his wife have promoted international adoption and have three daughters from China, including Maria. They also have three biological children.

If you’ve been watching the rescue you may have noticed that they are wearing a T-shirt that says “Gracias Senor” on the front (“Thank you Lord”).
These shirts were given to the miners as gifts from Campus Crusade for Christ Chile. On one sleeve is the logo for the Jesus Film.
A couple weeks ago, the Chilean CCC staff gave the 33 miners MP3 players with the New Testament and the audio “Story of Jesus” on them. One of the miners asked for the T-shirts which were then sent down to them. Of the many gifts they were given, they chose to wear the “Thank You Lord” T-shirt when they came out.
The back of the T-shirt has a Bible verse written out – Psalm 95:4, “In His hands are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also.” (Porque en su mano estan las profundidades de la tierra, y las alturas do los montes son suyas).
Chilean TV says that 1 billion people were watching this rescue. May all glory go to God!

The 3.3 kilogram (7.28 pounds) infant not even bruised by the dog that retrieved her Friday, as she sleeps at Kenyatta National hospital where she is being treated Monday, May 9, 2005.
A nursing dog foraging for food retrieved an abandoned baby girl in a forest in Kenya and carried the infant to its litter of puppies, witnesses said Monday.
The stray dog carried the infant across a busy road and through a barbed wire fence in a poor neighborhood near the Ngong Forest in the capital, Nairobi, Stephen Thoya told the independent Daily Nation newspaper.
The dog apparently found the baby Friday in the plastic bag in which the infant had been abandoned, said Aggrey Mwalimu, owner of the compound where the animal is now living. It was unclear how the baby survived in the bag without suffocating.
The infant reportedly was also wrapped in an old tattered shirt.
Resident Linet Gogany said she discovered the child among the dog’s puppy litter after local boys said they heard a baby crying.
Doctors said the baby had been abandoned about two days before the dog discovered her. Medical workers later found maggots in the infant’s umbilical cord, a product of days of neglect, Hannah Gakuo, the spokeswoman of the Kenyatta National Hospital, where the girl was taken for treatment, said Monday. No one has yet claimed the baby, she said.
But the 7.28 pounds infant “is doing well, responding to treatment, she is stable … she is on antibiotics,” Gakuo told The Associated Press. Workers at the hospital are calling the child Angel, she said.
Unwanted infants are often abandoned in Kenya — sometimes they are even dumped into pit latrines. Poverty and mothers’ failed relationships with fathers are often blamed for the problem, and Kenya’s weak law enforcement and social security systems means that most people who abandon babies are never caught.
“Abandoned babies are normally taken to the Kenyatta National Hospital because it is a public hospital,” Gakuo said. “People are now donating diapers and baby clothes for this one.”
Not all abandoned infants in Kenya are as lucky.

The guy who had the gall to express his First Amendment rights and favor Prop 8 in California by donating $1,000 has just been scalped by some gay activists. After an OKCupid decision to boycott Mozilla, the recently appointed Brendan Eich just resigned under pressure:
In a post at Mozilla’s official blog, executive chairwoman Mitchell Baker confirmed the news with an unequivocal apology on the company’s behalf. “Mozilla prides itself on being held to a different standard and, this past week, we didn’t live up to it,” Baker wrote. “We didn’t act like you’d expect Mozilla to act. We didn’t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We’re sorry. We must do better.”
The action comes days after dating site OKCupid became the most vocal opponent of Eich’s hiring. Mozilla offered repeated statements about LGBT inclusivity within the company over the past two weeks, but those never came with a specific response from Eich about his thousands of dollars of donations in support of Proposition 8, a California ballot measure that sought to ban gay marriage in the state.
Will he now be forced to walk through the streets in shame? Why not the stocks? The whole episode disgusts me – as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society. If this is the gay rights movement today – hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else – then count me out. If we are about intimidating the free speech of others, we are no better than the anti-gay bullies who came before us.

Eastwood attended a volunteer party on the eve of the PGA Tour event when he noticed tournament director Steve John choking on a piece of cheese. The 83-year-old actor quickly performed the Heimlich maneuver on Wednesday night at the Monterey Conference Center.
“I was drinking water and eating these little appetizers, threw down a piece of cheese and it just didn’t work,” John said on Friday. “I was looking at him and couldn’t breathe. He recognized it immediately and saved my life.”
Eastwood is a prominent figure at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, formerly as an amateur contestant and now as chairman of the Monterey Peninsula Foundation. It has raised over $100 million for charity as the host of the PGA Tour event.
He is often in the CBS tower on the weekend and presents the trophy to the winner, a list that includes Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Brandt Snedeker in recent years. Eastwood wasn’t expecting an additional duty this week.
“I looked in his eyes and saw that look of panic people have when they see their life passing before their eyes,” Eastwood told The Carmel Pine Cone. “It looked bad.”
He said it was the first time he had used the Heimlich maneuver.
“I can’t believe I’m 202 pounds and he threw me up in the air three times,” John said.
The party is one of the biggest nights of the week. Volunteers are entertained by the celebrities such as musician Kenny G and comedian Tom Dreesen. The 50-year-old John said it was the second time in his life someone had to perform the Heimlich on him.
“It was in Colorado about seven or eight years ago. But it wasn’t Clint Eastwood,” he said. “I haven’t talked to him since that night. It was crazy.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ice-dog-dish/	Ice in Dog Dish Warning	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"NO ICE WATER FOR DOGS…PLEASE READ ASAP

I am writing this in hopes that some may learn from what I just went through. We were having a good weekend till Saturday. On Saturday I showed my Baran and left the ring. He was looking good and at the top of his game. He had a chance at no
less then one of the two AOM’s.
It did not work out that way. After showing we went back to our site/setup and got the dogs in their crates to cool off. After being back about 30 min. I noticed Baran was low on water. I took a hand full of ice from my cooler and put it in his bucket with more water. We then started to get all the dogs Ex’ed and food ready for them.
I had Baran in his 48′ crate in the van because this is the place he loves to be. He loves to be able to see everyone and verything. After checking him and thinking he was cooled off enough, we fed him. We walked around and one of my friends stated that Baran seamed like he was choking. I went over and checked on him. He was dry heaving and drooling. I got him out of the crate to check him over and noticed he had not eaten. He was in some distress. I checked him over from head to toe and did not notice anything. I walked him around for about a minute when I noticed that he was starting to bloat. I did everything I was taught to do in this case. I was not able to get him to burp, and we gave him Phasezime.
We rushed Baran to a vet clinic. We called ahead and let them know we were on our way. They were set up and waiting for us. They got Baran stabilized very quickly. After Baran was stable and out of distress we transported him to AVREC where he went into surgery to make sure no damage was done to any of his vital organs. I am very happy to say Baran is doing great, there was no damage to any vital organs, and he still loves his food.
In surgery the vet found that Baran’s stomach was in its normal anatomic position. We went over what had happened. When I told the vet about the ice water, he asked why I gave him ice water. I said that I have always done this. I told him my history behind this practice and his reply was, “I have been very lucky.” The ice water I gave Baran caused violent muscle spasms in his stomach which caused the bloating. Even though I figured his temperature was down enough to feed, and gave him this ice water, I was wrong. His internal temperature was still high. The vet stated that giving a dog ice to chew or ice water is a big NO, NO! There is no reason for a dog to have ice/ice water. Normal water at room temperature, or cooling with cold towels on the inner thigh, is the best way to help cool a dog. The vet explained it to me like this: If you, as a person, fall into a frozen lake what happens to your muscles? They cramp. This is the same as a dog’s stomach.
I felt the need to share this with everyone, in the hopes that some may learn from what I went through, I do not wish this on anyone. Baran is home now doing fine. So please, if you do use ice and ice water, beware of what could happen.

Lt. Col Matthew Dooley, a West Point graduate and highly-decorated combat veteran, was an instructor at the Joint Forces Staff College at the National Defense University. He had 19 years of service and experience, and was considered one of the most highly qualified military instructors on Radical Islam & Terrorism.
He taught military students about the situations they would encounter, how to react, about Islamic culture, traditions, and explained the mindset of Islamic extremists. Passing down first hand knowledge and experience, and teaching courses that were suggested (and approved) by the the Joint Forces Staff College. The course “Perspectives on Islam and Islamic Radicalism” ,which was suggested and approved by the Joint Forces Staff College, caught the attention of several Islamic Groups, and they wanted to make an example of him.
They collectively wrote a letter expressing their outrage, and the Pro-Islamic Obama Administration was all too happy to assist. The letter was passed to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Martin Dempsey. Dempsey publicly degraded and reprimanded Dooley, and Dooley received a negative Officer Evaluation Report almost immediately (which he had aced for the past 5 years). He was relieved of teaching duties, and his career has been red-flagged.
“He had a brilliant career ahead of him. Now, he has been flagged.” – Richard Thompson, Thomas More Law Center
“All US military Combatant Commands, Services, the National Guard Bureau, and Joint Chiefs are under Dempsey’s Muslim Brotherhood-dictated order to ensure that henceforth, no US military course will ever again teach truth about Islam that the jihadist enemy finds offensive ,or just too informative.” – Former CIA agent Claire M. Lopez (about Lt. Col Dooley)
The Obama Administration has demonstrated lightning speed to dismiss Military brass that does not conform to it’s agenda, and not surprisingly, nobody is speaking up for Lt. Col. Dooley.
IT’S A SAD DAY FOR THIS COUNTRY WHEN GOOD LOYAL MEN LIKE THIS GET THROWN UNDER THE BUS BECAUSE NOBODY HAS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP!

But this guy has pictures to prove his story…

I’ve heard of salmon jumping into boats, but never anything quite like this.
Tom Satre told the Sitka Gazette that he was out with a charter group on his 62-foot fishing vessel when four juvenile black-tailed deer swam directly toward his boat.
“Once the deer reached the boat, the four began to circle the boat, looking directly at us. We could tell right away that the young bucks were distressed. I opened up my back gate and we helped the typically skittish and absolutely wild animals onto the boat. In all my years fishing, I’ve never seen anything quite like it!   Once onboard, they collapsed with exhaustion, shivering.”
“This is a picture I took of the rescued bucks on the back of my boat, the Alaska Quest.


We headed for Taku Harbour. Once we reached the dock, the first buck that we had been pulled from the water hopped onto the dock, looked back as if to say ‘thank you’ and disappeared into the forest. After a bit of prodding and assistance, two more followed, but the smallest deer needed a little more help.




This is me carrying the little guy.

My daughter, Anna, and son, Tim, helped the last buck to its feet. We didn’t know how long they had been in the icy waters or if there had been others who did not survive. My daughter later told me that the experience was something that she would never forget, and I suspect the deer felt the same way as well!”
I told you! Awesome… huh?

https://www.truthorfiction.com/charles-gaouette/	President Obama Fired Navy Admiral for Responding to Attack	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"
According to this report, yesterday (27 October) Obama ordered the immediate removal of Rear Admiral Charles M. Gaouette from his command of the powerful Carrier Strike Group Three (CSG-3) currently located in the Middle East .
CSG-3 is one of five US Navy carrier strike groups currently assigned to the US Pacific Fleet. US Navy carrier strike groups are employed in a variety of roles, which involve gaining and maintaining sea control and projecting power ashore, as well as projecting naval airpower ashore.
The aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) is the strike group’s current flagship, and as of 2012, other units assigned to Carrier Strike Group Three include Carrier Air Wing Nine; the guided-missile cruisers USS Mobile Bay (CG-53) and USS Antietam (CG-54); and the ships of Destroyer Squadron 21, the guided-missile destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Dewey (DDG-105), USS Kidd (DDG-100), and USS Milius (DDG-69).
US news reports on Obama’s unprecedented firing of a powerful US Navy Commander during wartime state that Admiral Gaouette’s removal was for “allegations of inappropriate leadership judgment” that arose during the strike group’s deployment to the Middle East .
This GRU report, however, states that Admiral Gaouette’s firing by President Obama was due to this strike force commander disobeying orders when he ordered his forces on 11 September to “assist and provide intelligence for” American military forces ordered into action by US Army General Carter Ham, who was then the commander of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), against terrorist forces attacking the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
General Ham had been in command of the initial 2011 US-NATO military intervention in Libya who, like Admiral Gaouette, was fired by Obama. And as we can, in part, read from US military insider accounts of this growing internal conflict between the White House and US Military leaders:
“The information I heard today was that General [Carter] Ham as head of Africom received the same e-mails the White House received requesting help/support as the attack was taking place. General Ham immediately had a rapid response unit ready and communicated to the Pentagon that he had a unit ready.
General Ham then received the order to stand down. His response was to screw it, he was going to help anyhow. Within 30 seconds to a minute after making the move to respond, his second in command apprehended General Ham and told him that he was now relieved of his command.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/giant-shark/	15ton Prehistoric Shark Captured in Pakistan	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"15-ton Prehistoric Shark Captured in Pakistan

A giant prehistoric shark previously thought to be extinct for more than 20 million years has been captured by local fishermen off the coast of Pakistan, reports the Islamabad Herald this morning.
The giant creature first thought to be a great white shark was rapidly declared by experts to be an unknown species of shark as it’s great weight and size were unheard of. Analysis of the teeth suggest the shark to be a parent of the Megalodon, an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 28 to 1.5 million years ago, during the Cenozoic Era.
The sea creature that measures an incredible 10.4 meters and weighs an astounding 15.6 tons is the largest living shark ever caught to date, great white sharks reaching an impressive 7 tons at full growth, a size that is no match for this giant prehistoric shark that can reach an imposing 20 meters in length and possibly weight up to 30 tons, depending on estimates.
The specimen was revealed not to be fully grown and is estimated to be 2 or 3 years old and already twice the size of a full grown white shark, which takes 5 years to reach its full growth.
A quick autopsy revealed the creature lives under great depths, feeding on giant squid and other fish not commonly found near the surface, which makes the discovery even more incredible to experts.
The recent discovery has raised great enthusiasm from experts abroad who are pondering the fact that other thought to be extinct species might still be dwelling in the depths of the seas. “This is very exciting news for the future of ocean exploration as technology is permitting us to go deeper and deeper every day” explains marine biologist Suzan Chopper from the University of Sydney, Australia. “I just don’t know how well our submarines would do against a giant monster like this” she adds.

In 2007, Gemma Sheridan and 2 friends set out on a voyage that was to take them from their home town of Liverpool, across the Atlantic to the Panama Canal and then onwards to the beautiful island of Hawaii.
The first stage of the voyage went without incident. However, after passing through the Panama Canal and into the Pacific, things started to take a turn for the worse.
There was a huge storm that took out the boats electronics and washed her 2 friends overboard and seriously damaged her boat. Without any electronics and with a damaged boat, Gemma drifted for 17 days until she was hit by another major storm. During the storm, Gemma was knocked unconscious and the rest is history.
Gemma awoke on a beach, surrounded by wreckage from her boat.
Here is a short account of some of the things she endured:
Within the first hour I had a major panic attack. It was a disturbing feeling, being alone, isolated, so far from home without a hope.
I had been on water rations for the last 2 weeks, so finding water was the first priority. There where no pools of fresh water, so I had to rig up a contraption that drew the water away from the rock and I managed to get one drop every 50 seconds. That was my only source of water, so it was coconuts until it rained. Not the best start.
The amount of energy required to do anything massive and it was mentally taxing.
For the first 2 weeks I stayed in a mock shelter i made from debris that washed ashore. I needed to find real shelter, I found a large tree that looked perfect. I nibbled away at the bark of a tree with a giant clam shell for 11 days just to build a shelter. It might have been bomb-proof and waterproof in the end and it’s probably still standing but if I’d had a machete, just that one tool, I would have been able to build it in a few hours.
It was four weeks before I managed to light a fire – you have no idea how happy that made me.
There were eight feral goats on the island, three adults and five kids. I seen them occasionally, but they would always get away.
I made a bow and arrow, but this just went twang and fell on the floor. And my spear wasn’t sharp enough.
So, when the hunting tools didn’t work, I spent seven days building a coral-type trap with spikes on it and everything. I thought “Yes. This’ll do it”. It didn’t.
One day I was walking round the island looking for crabs and saw what I thought was driftwood caught up in the bottom of this tree. Then it bleated.
This goat had been eating the leaves, got its horns caught and panicked. It was a massive thing, about 45 or 50 kilos and it was meat, so I tried squeezing its windpipe but that wouldn’t do it and then I had to bash it on the head with a clam shell.
It took about 15 minutes to kill it and was quite gruesome. It showed me how far I was from being able to hunt because even though it was trapped it still took me quarter of an hour.
Fast forward a few years and everything had changed:
The physical side was tough but ultimately fine. I did a series of exercises on the beach every day – press-ups, chin-ups on a tree branch, squats with boulders on my shoulders and shuttle runs of about 300 metres.
I had managed to get to a stage when I was getting stronger.
The difficulty was elsewhere. My mind was lonely and it was begining to dawn on me that I may never be saved. Usually if you’re on a desert island and you start talking to yourself it is an indication that things are going wrong.
I had a sign on the beach that was about 10 feet high, but it had sat there all this time and nothing came of it. So I decided to go all out, I spent the next few weeks clearing space and finding materials to build a huge sign in the sand on the beach.
My hope was that perhaps a plane might fly over and see it, but in all my time on the island, I had not seen 1 single plane fly over. I didn’t give up though.
Fast forward a couple more years:
I woke up 1 morning to the sound of a plane flying over me which was unusually low, I could not believe it, I thought it was a dream. I ran to the beach screaming and waving my arms like a lunatic, the plane flew over 2 or 3 more times and then dropped a small package.
Inside was a radio, fresh water, food and a small medical kit. I switched on the radio and heard the first human voice for years. We talked for what seemed like an eternity, then I asked the voice on the other end “How did you find me” to which they replied “Some kid from Minnesota found your SOS sign on Google Earth”
I didnt even know what Google Earth was, but I’m eternally in their debt now.

Mohammed Bakr al-Baghdadi, the brother of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who is the Caliph of the self-proclaimed Islamic State, has converted to Christianity, reports Al-Jazeera this morning.
The move has brought the man an unprecedented backlash from the Salafist Sunni community that has ordered a fatwa, or death-sentence, on the man as soon as the news was spread in media around the muslim world.
«He is no more my brother then the miscreant American pigs we slay everyday» told the self-proclaimed Caliph to a large crowd of his followers. «Let Allah not forget this treacherous swine when he pleads on his knees to enter the gates of Heaven and is thrown back into the pits of Hell» he cried out, before issuing a death-sentence on his own brother’s head.

“You don’t believe they’re here? Look who was just found at Jason’s Deli in at West 34th and 290 in Houston. That’s the black standard ISIS emblem on his shoulder. Share the hell outta this.” -Mike Kasper
BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS AT ALL TIMES
ISIS
An alert American in the Houston area snapped these photos at Jason’s Deli yesterday at 11:30 AM (9-3-2014). The deli is located in the Spring Branch area.
Mike Kasper sent us these photos and wants you to know you can mitigate possible damages if you report things like this and intervene when necessary.
Mr. Kasper was standing in line to grab lunch and noticed a black-robed Jihadist with the ISIS symbol on his shoulder. He got out his phone and snapped as many photos as he could. Others in line were watching but weren’t doing the same; but he heard chatter when he got to his table.
Mike reports:
There are at least 10 mosques or Islamic centers within a 15 mile radius. This is a very populated area of northwest Houston but it is predominantly Hispanic. The majority of the Muslim population is concentrated in the southwest part of town.
We thank Mike for his work and for sharing what he has seen with us so we can be aware. Please pass it along. We have put a large photo of this symbol with Mike’s photo collage so you will know it when you see it.
THANK YOU MIKE FOR BEING AWARE AND ALERT AND SHARING WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND.

Irena Sendler
There recently was a death of a 98 year-old lady named Irena. During WWII, Irena, got permission to work in the Warsaw Ghetto, as a Plumbing/Sewer specialist. She had an ‘ulterior motive’ … She KNEW what the Nazi’s plans were for the Jews, (being German.) Irena smuggled infants out in the bottom of the tool box she carried and she carried in the back of her truck a burlap sack, (for larger kids..) She also had a dog in the back that she trained to bark when the Nazi soldiers let her in and out of the ghetto. The soldiers of course wanted nothing to do with the dog and the barking covered the kids/infants noises… During her time of doing this, she managed to smuggle out and save 2500 kids/infants. She was caught, and the Nazi’s broke both her legs, arms and beat her severely. Irena kept a record of the names of all the kids she smuggled out and kept them in a glass jar, buried under a tree in her back yard. After the! war, she tried to locate any parents that may have survived it and reunited the family. Most had been gassed. Those kids she helped got placed into foster family homes or adopted.
Last year Irena was up for the Nobel Peace Prize … She was not selected…

https://www.truthorfiction.com/kilroy/	The Origin of “Kilroy Was Here!”	Unproven!				2015/03/17	"KILROY WAS HERE! 
In 1946 the American Transit Association, through its radio
program, “Speak to America,” sponsored a nationwide contest to find the
REAL Kilroy, offering a prize of a real trolley car to the person who
couldprove himself to be the genuine article.
Almost 40 men stepped forward to make that claim, but only James
Kilroy from Halifax, Massachusetts had evidence of his identity.
Kilroy was a 46-year old shipyard worker during the war. He
worked as a checker at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy. His job was to
go around and check on the number of rivets completed. Riveters were on
piecework and got paid by the rivet.
Kilroy would count a block of rivets and put a check mark in
semi-waxed lumber chalk, so the rivets wouldn’t be counted twice. When
Kilroy went off duty, the riveters would erase the mark.
Later on, an off-shift inspector would come through and count
the rivets a second time, resulting in double pay for the riveters.
One day Kilroy’s boss called him into his office. The foreman
was upset about all the wages being paid to riveters, and asked him to
investigate. It was then that he realized what had been going on.
The tight spaces he had to crawl in to check the rivets didn’t
lend themselves to lugging around a paint can and brush, so Kilroy
decided to stick with the waxy chalk. He continued to put his checkmark
on each job he inspected, but added KILROY WAS HERE in king-sized
letters next to the check, and eventually added the sketch of the chap
with the long nose peering over the fence and that became part of the
Kilroy message. Once he did that, the riveters stopped trying to wipe
away his marks.
Ordinarily the rivets and chalk marks would have been covered up
with paint. With war on, however, ships were leaving the Quincy Yard so
fast that there wasn’t time to paint them.
As a result, Kilroy’s inspection “trademark” was seen by
thousands of servicemen who boarded the troopships the yard produced.
His message apparently rang a bell with the servicemen, because they
picked it up and spread it all over Europe and the South Pacific. Before
the war’s end, “Kilroy” had been here, there, and everywhere on the long
haul to Berlin and Tokyo.
To the unfortunate troops outbound in those ships, however, he
was a complete mystery; all they knew for sure was that some jerk named
Kilroy had “been there first.” As a joke, U.S. servicemen began placing
the graffiti wherever they landed, claiming it was already there when
they arrived.
Kilroy became the U.S. super-GI who had always “already been”
wherever GIs went. It became a challenge to place the logo in the most
unlikely places imaginable (it is said to be atop Mt. Everest, the
Statue of Liberty, the underside of the Arch De Triumphe, and even
scrawled in the dust on the moon.)
And as the war went on, the legend grew. Underwater demolition
teams routinely sneaked ashore on Japanese-held islands in the Pacific
to map the terrain for the coming invasions by U.S. troops (and thus,
presumably, were the first GI’s there). On one occasion, however, they
reported seeing enemy troops painting over the Kilroy logo! In 1945, an
outhouse was built for the exclusive use of Roosvelt, Stalin, and
Churchill at the Potsdam conference.
The first person inside was Stalin, who emerged and asked his
aide (in Russian), “Who is Kilroy?” …
To help prove his authenticity in 1946, James Kilroy brought
along officials from the shipyard and some of the riveters. He won the
trolley car, which he gave to his nine children as a Christmas gift and
set it up as a playhouse in the Kilroy front yard in Halifax,
Massachusetts.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/lemons-kill-cancer/	Lemons Kill Cancer Cells Better Than Chemotherapy	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Lemons Kill Cancer Cells Better Than Chemotherapy
 
 

Many professionals in restaurants and eateries are using or consuming the entire lemon and nothing is wasted. How can you use the whole lemon without waste?
Simple.. place the washed lemon in the freezer section of your refrigerator. Once the lemon is frozen, get your grater, and shred the whole lemon (no need to peel it) and sprinkle it on top of your foods.
Sprinkle it to your vegetable salad, ice cream, soup, cereals, noodles, spaghetti sauce, rice, sushi, fish dishes, whiskey…. the list is endless.
All of the foods will unexpectedly have a wonderful taste, something that you may have never tasted before. Most likely, you only think of lemon juice and vitamin C. Not anymore.
Now that you’ve learned this lemon secret, you can use lemon even in instant cup noodles.
What’s the major advantage of using the whole lemon other than preventing waste and adding new taste to your dishes?
Well, you see lemon peels contain as much as 5 to 10 times more vitamins than the lemon juice itself. And yes, that’s what you’ve been wasting.
But from now on, by following this simple procedure of freezing the whole lemon, then grating it on top of your dishes, you can consume all of those nutrients and get even healthier.
It’s also good that lemon peels are health rejuvenators in eradicating toxic elements in the body.
So place your washed lemon in your freezer, and then grate it on your meal every day. It is a key to make your foods tastier and you get to live healthier and longer! That’s the lemon secret! Better late than never, right? The surprising benefits of lemon!
Lemon (Citrus) is a miraculous product to kill cancer cells. It is 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy.
Why do we not know about that? Because there are laboratories interested in making a synthetic version that will bring them huge profits.
You can now help a friend in need by letting him/her know that lemon juice is beneficial in preventing the disease. Its taste is pleasant and it does not produce the horrific effects of chemotherapy.
How many people will die while this closely guarded secret is kept, so as not to jeopardize the beneficial multimillionaires large corporations?
As you know, the lemon tree is known for its varieties of lemons and limes.
You can eat the fruit in different ways: you can eat the pulp, juice press, prepare drinks, sorbets, pastries, etc… It is credited with many virtues, but the most interesting is the effect it produces on cysts and tumors.
This plant is a proven remedy against cancers of all types. Some say it is very useful in all variants of cancer. It is considered also as an anti microbial spectrum against bacterial infections and fungi, effective against internal parasites and worms, it regulates blood pressure which is too high and an antidepressant, combats stress and nervous disorders.
The source of this information is fascinating: it comes from one of the largest drug manufacturers in the world, says that after more than 20 laboratory tests since 1970, the extracts revealed that It destroys the malignant cells in 12 cancers, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreas…
The compounds of this tree showed 10,000 times better than the product Adriamycin, a drug normally used chemotherapeutic in the world, slowing the growth of cancer cells.
And what is even more astonishing: this type of therapy with lemon extract only destroys malignant cancer cells and it does not affect healthy cells.
So, give those lemons a good wash, freeze them and grate them. Your whole body will love you for it!!!!!

Oxford and Cambridge have now decided to remove the words CAN’T and IMPOSSIBLE from their dictionary.
Jessica Cox, 25, a girl born without arms, stands inside an aircraft. The girl from Tucson , Arizona got the Sport Pilot certificate lately and became the first pilot licensed to fly using only her feet.  Jessica Cox of Tucson was born without arms, but that has only stopped her from doing one thing: using the word “can’t.”
Her latest flight into the seemingly impossible is becoming the first pilot licensed to fly using only her feet.
With one foot manning the controls and the other delicately guiding the steering column, Cox, 25, soared to achieve a Sport Pilot certificate Her certificate qualifies her to fly a light-sport aircraft to altitudes of 10,000 feet.
“She’s a good pilot. She’s rock solid,” said Parrish Traweek, 42, the flying instructor at San Manuel’s Ray Blair Airport .    Parrish Traweek runs PC Aircraft Maintenance and Flight Services and has trained many pilots, some of whom didn’t come close to Cox’s abilities.
“When she came up here driving a car,” Traweek recalled, “I knew she’d have no problem flying a plane.”
      
 
Doctors never learned why she was born without arms, but she figured out early on that she didn’t want to use prosthetic devices.    So, the next time you are ready to tell yourself, “I can’t possibly…” remember this amazing young woman and change your vocabulary.

 Washington, D.C. – Sept. 25, 2009 there will be a national prayer gathering of Muslims on the west front of the U.S. Capitol Building. They are expecting at least 50,000 to attend from mosques all across America. They will gather to pray from 4:00 AM until 7:00 PM, – fifteen hours of approved prayer on federal government property! The organizers say Obama’s inauguration speech in January and his speech broadcast from Egypt in June gave them the idea for this prayer gathering. (America is not a Christian Nation…..)
 There’s a web site set up to promote this event.
 If you never look at another web site look at this one (even listen to their prayer): islamoncapitolhill.com

“IT IS WHAT IT IS”
Subject: Fwd: ISLAMIC DAY OF PRAYER AT WHITEHOUSE
 
“It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless, minority; keen to set brush fires in people’s minds…”  -Samuel Adams 
Obama cancelled the National Day of Prayer service traditionally held at the Whitehouse. Now…….this. The Islamic Prayer Day last week at the Whitehouse. 
For Obama to continue as our President is an insult to our founding fathers (and to all Americans). 
If you question the impact of the above picture, I would suggest you get a copy of the book The Sword of the Prophet by Serge Trifkovic.  It is well researched and documented, so is trustworthy.  Anyone who believes that ‘Islam is not a major threat to our freedom and country’ has their head in the sand.  This includes Obama himself.

NORFOLK Naval Air Station Virginia — One of the military’s largest
transports got stuck at the end of a runway atop the I-564 overpass
for more than 16 hours. It was unable to turn around at the West end
of Chambers Field at the Norfolk Naval Station. The incident forced
the closing of the field to all but helicopter traffic and made for a
dramatic sight for hundreds of motorists passing beneath it during
morning rush hour.
“That thing’s like a big building sitting there.” said motorists.
The nose of the aircraft actually stuck out and OVER the Interstate!
The aircraft’s nose was so far over the end of the ramp, the crew was
unable to see the runway where it was supposed to turn around so the
pilot simply had to leave it at the end of the runway. The Air Force
C-5 Galaxy, largest airplane in the free world, is almost as long as
a football field and as high as a six-story building.
Weighing 420 tons with a full load, it uses a system of 28 wheels to
distribute its weight. The aircraft had to wait for a specially made
tow bar trucked in from Dover, Delaware! When the tow bar arrived,
it was used to hook the C-5 to a tractor that then turned the
aircraft around. The plane was not damaged.

OKLAHOMA CITY – First Horse meat, then the mysterious “Pink slime”, Now Human meat? A shocking discovery has been made in an Oklahoma City McDonald’s meat factory and other McDonald’s meat factories nationwide. Meat inspectors reportedly found, what appeared to be, Human meat stored in the meat factory freezers of an Oklahoma City meat factory and human meat already in trucks right outside the factory ready to be shipped to McDonald’s restaurants. Health inspectors immediately demanded inspection in various McDonald’s meat factories across the country and horrifyingly found human meat in about 90% of the factories inspected thus far.
The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has seized McDonald’s production and shipping and will call for more meat factory inspections and restaurant inspections. The FBI is also investigating the factories. FBI agent Lloyd Harrison told Huzler reporters “The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s child meat. the body parts that were found across the U.S. factories were deemed to small to be adult body parts, this is truly horrible”.
The situation brings up many unanswered questions. How long have they been using human meat? Where did they get the children from? Were they already dead when brought into factories? Investigators and Inspectors are currently being deployed for intensive investigations all around the U.S.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/marijuana-overdoses/	Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado	Fiction! & Satire!				2015/03/17	"Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization
Colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses.
According to a report in the Rocky Mountain News, 37 people were killed across the state on January 1st, the first day the drug became legal for all adults to purchase. Several more are clinging onto life in local emergency rooms and are not expected to survive.
“It’s complete chaos here,” says Dr. Jack Shepard, chief of surgery at St. Luke’s Medical Center in Denver, “I’ve put five college students in body bags since breakfast and more are arriving every minute.
“We are seeing cardiac arrests, hypospadias, acquired trimethylaminuria and multiple organ failures. By next week the death toll could go as high as 200, maybe 300. Someone needs to step in and stop this madness. My god, why did we legalize marijuana? What were we thinking?”
Rainin’ Fire in the Sky
Colorado and Washington state approved the sale of marijuana for recreational use in November though statewide ballot measures. Under the new policies pot is legal for adult use, regulated like alcohol and heavily taxed.
One of the principal arguments of legalization advocates was that cannabis has long been considered safer than alcohol and tobacco and was not thought not to cause overdose. But a brave minority tried to warn Coloradans of the drug’s dangers.
“We told everyone this would happen,” says Peter Swindon, President and CEO of local brewer MolsonCoors, “Marijuana is a deadly hardcore drug that causes addiction and destroys lives.
“When was the last time you heard of someone overdosing on beer? All these pro-marijuana groups should be ashamed of themselves. The victims’ blood is on their hands.”
One of the those victims was 29-year-old Jesse Bruce Pinkman, a former methamphetamine dealer from Albuquerque who had recently moved to Boulder to establish a legal marijuana dispensary.
Pinkman was partying with friends when he suffered several seizures and a massive heart attack which ultimately proved to be fatal. Toxicology reports revealed that marijuana was the only drug present in his system.
“This is just a terrible tragedy,” says his friend Peter, “Jesse was trying to go legit and now this happens? I guess drugs really are as dangerous as they say.”
Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the ballot initiative that legalized the drug, says he will call a special legislative session to try and overturn the new law.
“We can’t sit idly by and allow this slaughter to continue,” he says.

Sea unearths secret Nazi bunkers that lay hidden for more than 50 years:
Three Nazi bunkers on a beach have been uncovered by violent storms off the Danish coast, providing a store of material for history buffs and military archaeologists. The bunkers were found in practically the same condition as they were on the day the last Nazi soldiers left them, down to the tobacco in one trooper’s pipe and a half-finished bottle of schnapps.
This bunker was entombed under the sand dunes until a violent storm swept away the sands three months ago.
The bunkers had not been touched since the war.
The bunkers were three of 7,000 built by the Germans as part of Hitler’s ‘Atlantic Wall’ from Norway to the south of France. But while the vast majority were almost immediately looted or destroyed, these three were entombed under the sand dunes of a remote beach near the town of Houvig since 1945. They were uncovered only because recent storms sent giant waves cascading over them, sweeping away the sand and exposing glimpses of the cement and iron structures.
Kim Clausen, curator of the Ringkoebing-Skjern museum views a heater retrieved from the bunker.
Stamps of the German Eagle of Adolf Hitler and the Swastika were also retrieved.
They were located by two nine-year-old boys on holiday with their parents, who then informed the authorities. Archaeologists were able to carefully force a way, and were astounded at what they found. What’s so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds, ‘chairs, tables, communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside,’ says Jens Andersen, the curator of the Hanstholm museum.
The discovery of the fully-furnished bunkers was ‘unique in Europe,’ said Bent Anthonisen, a Danish expert on European bunkers.
Expert Tommy Cassoe: ‘It was as if the Nazis had just left yesterday’ .
And a third expert, Tommy Cassoe, enthused: ‘It was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around. What I saw blew me away: it was as if the German soldiers had left only yesterday.’ The team working with Cassoe emptied the structures within a few days of boots, undergarments, socks, military stripes, mustard and aquavit bottles, books, inkpots, stamps featuring Hitler, medicines, soda bottles, keys, hammers and other objects. All of the objects from the shelters have been taken to the conservation centre at Oelgod museum, some 20 miles from the beach to be examined.
The centre’s German curator, Gert Nebrich, judged the find ‘very interesting because it is so rare.’ ”We don’t expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved. Maybe it’s because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum,’ he says, carefully showing four stamps featuring Hitler’s image and the German eagle, found in one bunker. The Germans left the bunkers in May 1945 after the Nazi surrender.
Historical records show that Gerhard Saalfed was a 17-year-old soldier with the German army when he arrived at the bunker in January 1945.
Germany surrendered on May 8 1945, but it wasn’t until two days later that he and his fellow soldiers left their remote station. They shut the steel doors of the bunker behind them on their remote beach and went to the nearest town ten miles away to surrender.
‘The remote location of the bunkers and the drifting sands that covered them saved them from being ransacked,’ said Cassoe.

This may be a first…
A couple from Montana were out riding on the range, he with his rifle and she (fortunately) with her camera. Their dogs always followed them, but on this occasion a Mountain Lion decided that he wanted to stalk the dogs (you’ll see the dogs in the background watching). Very, very bad decision…
The hunter got off the mule with his rifle and decided to shoot in the air to scare away the lion, but before he could get off a shot the lion charged in and decided he wanted a piece of those dogs. With that, the mule took off and decided he wanted a piece of that lion. That’s when all hell broke loose… for the lion.
As the lion approached the dogs the mule snatched him up by the tail and started whirling him around. Banging its head on the ground on every pass. Then he dropped it, stomped on it and held it to the ground by the throat. The mule then got down on his knees and bit the thing all over a couple of dozen times to make sure it was dead, than whipped it into the air again, walked back over to the couple (that were stunned in silence) and stood there ready to continue his ride… as if nothing had just happened.
Fortunately even though the hunter didn’t get off a shot, his wife got off these 4…

A Christian Nation cannot put up a Christmas scene of the baby Jesus in a public place, but the Muslims can stop normal traffic every Friday afternoon by worshiping in the streets… Something is happening in America that is reminiscent of what is happening in Europe . This is Political Correctness gone crazy…
This is an accurate picture of every Friday afternoon in several locations throughout NYC where there are mosques with a large number of Muslims that cannot fit into the mosque – They fill the surrounding streets, facing east for a couple of hours between about 2 & 4 p.m. – Besides this one at 42nd St & Madison Ave , there is another, even larger group, at 94th St & 3rd Ave , etc., etc. – Also, I presume, you are aware of the dispute over building another “high rise” Mosque a few blocks from “ground zero” – With regard to that one, the “Imam” refuses to disclose where the $110 million dollars to build it is coming from and there is a lawsuit filed to force disclosure of that information – Just some facts FYI – But then, you have your own troubles with the “immigration” problem and the new AZ law – November can’t come soon enough This is in New York City on Madison Avenue, not in France or the Middle East or Yemen or Kenya .
Is there a message here???? Yes, there is, and they are claiming America for allah. if we don’t wake up soon, we are going to “politically correct” ourselves right out of our own country!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/admiral-nimitz-japan/	Admiral Chester Nimitz on Japan’s Three Mistakes	Pending Investigation!				2015/03/17	" Japan’s 3 Mistakes:
 

Tour boats ferry people out to the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii every thirty minutes.
We just missed a ferry and had to wait thirty minutes. I went into a small gift shop to kill time. In the gift shop, I purchased a small book entitled, “Reflections on Pearl Harbor” by Admiral Chester Nimitz.
Sunday, December 7th, 1941–Admiral Chester Nimitz was attending a concert in Washington D.C. He was paged and told there was a phone call for him.
When he answered the phone, it was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
He told Admiral Nimitz that he (Nimitz) would now be the Commander of the Pacific Fleet.
Admiral Nimitz flew to Hawaii to assume command of the Pacific Fleet. He landed at Pearl Harbor on Christmas Eve, 1941.
There was such a spirit of despair, dejection and Defeat — you would have thought the Japanese had already won the war.
On Christmas Day, 1941, Adm. Nimitz was given a boat tour of the destruction wrought on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. Big sunken battleships and navy vessels cluttered the waters
everywhere you looked.
As the tour boat returned to dock, the young helmsman of the boat asked, “Well Admiral, what do you think after seeing all this destruction?”
Admiral Nimitz’s reply shocked everyone within the sound of his voice.
Admiral Nimitz said, “The Japanese made three of the biggest mistakes an attack force could ever make, or God was taking care of America. Which do you think it was?”
Shocked and surprised, the young helmsman asked, “What do you mean by saying the Japanese made the three biggest mistakes an attack force ever made?”
Nimitz explained:
Mistake number one: the Japanese attacked on Sunday morning. Nine out of every ten crewmen of those ships were ashore on leave. If those same ships had been lured to sea and been sunk — we would have lost 38,000 men instead of 3,800.
Mistake number two: when the Japanese saw all those battleships lined in a row, they got so carried away sinking those battleships, they never once bombed our dry docks opposite those ships. If they had destroyed our dry docks, we would have had to tow every one of those ships to the mainland to be repaired. As it is now, the ships are in shallow water and can be raised. One tug can pull them over to the dry docks, and we can have them repaired and at sea by the time we could have towed them to the mainland. And I already
have crews ashore anxious to man those ships.
Mistake number three: Every drop of fuel in the Pacific theater of war is on top of the ground in storage tanks five miles away over that hill. One attack plane could have strafed those tanks and destroyed our fuel supply.
That’s why I say the Japanese made three of the biggest mistakes an attack force could make, or God was taking care of America .
I’ve never forgotten what I read in that little book. It is still an inspiration as I reflect upon it.
In jest, I might suggest that because Admiral Nimitz was a Texan, born and raised in Fredricksburg , Texas — he was a born optimist.
But anyway you look at it — Admiral Nimitz was able to see a silver lining in a situation and circumstance where everyone else saw only despair and defeatism.
President Roosevelt had chosen the right man for the right job.
We desperately needed a leader that could see silver linings in the midst of the clouds of dejection, despair and defeat.
There is a reason that our national motto is, “IN GOD WE TRUST.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-gas-stations/	Obama Gas Stations Pumping Free Gas In Poor Neighborhoods	 Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Government Opening Free Gas Stations in Poor Neighborhoods

Oct 29, 2013
First ‘Obamastation’ Debuts in Detroit, Seventy Planned Nationwide3
Obamastation As the battle over Obamacare rages in Washington, the White House is quietly using a little known provision of the law to roll out a nationwide network of free gas stations for minorities and the poor.
According to a report in The Detroit News this morning, the administration is using its authority under the Affordable Care Act to “improve transportation routes to hospitals” to dispense gasoline free of cost in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
The $2 billion-a-year program aims to distribute 40 million gallons of free gasoline each year through 70 new gas stations constructed in major metropolitan areas. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) will be responsible for operating the network, whose first station opened yesterday in Detroit.
“It’s not something we’re publicizing very much, for obvious reasons,” explains Dori Salcido, assistant DHS secretary for public affairs. “But under the law we are well within our rights to offer this service, and we think it’s good public policy.
“How are people supposed to get to the doctor’s office if they don’t have gas in their cars? Health insurance is worthless if you can’t make your appointment. This is just another fine example of government stepping in and solving big problems.”
No Gas for You
Although some developing oil-rich nations like Venezuela and Indonesia subsidize gasoline for the poor, the practice has never before been tried in the United States. The plans are proving controversial with some taxpayers who are loathe to see their money go to subsidize others.
“So basically I’m being punished for not living in the ghetto,” says Colin Blair, a white person from the affluent Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills. “I have three kids and a mortgage. Life isn’t cheap for me either. I could use some free gasoline too.”
An investigation into the station’s operations, however, reveals that Blair is unlikely to be able to use the service.
“Supposedly access to the station is determined by income,” says Ebony Jackson, manager of the first Obamastation. “But it’s pretty unrealistic to do an income check on each and every driver. So what we do is basically let all the black people pump for free, and charge all the white people the market rate.”
The Obamastations scandal was uncovered by Nolan Finley , a conservative Detroit News columnist widely lauded for his groundbreaking exposé on Obamaphones. Finley says the blatant racial bias in the program is only one of its many outrageous aspects.
“The stations have Obama campaign logo on them and giant photos of the president,” he explains. “He’s trying to buy votes ahead of the midterm elections. This is something you normally only see in third world countries. I’ve never been more scared for our democracy.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/praying-hands/	The Inspiration for Albrecht Dürer’s Famous Artwork “The Praying Hands”	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Story Behind Praying Hands by Albrecht Durer
 
 
 
February 21, 2009
“Praying Hands” (study for an Apostle figure of the “Heller” altar, 1508). Dürer, Albrecht.
The actual drawing of Hands, sketched in 1508, was intended as apreliminary study for an altarpiece commissioned by a wealthy Frankfort citizen, Jacob Heller. Nevertheless, the drawing is finished down to the last detail, because Durer planned to transpose it exactly in the final oil painting. For 13 months Durer worked on the final painting, determined to make it so sound and beautiful “that it will remain bright and fresh for five hundred years.“
The Legend Behind the Praying Hands
Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood.
Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder’s children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.
After many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in the mines.
They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht’s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works.
When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht’s triumphanthomecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head of the table to honor his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, “And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.”
All heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, “No …no …no …no.”
Finally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, “No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look … look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. No, brother … for me it is too late.”
More than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer’s hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer’s works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.
One day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother’s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply “Hands,” but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love “The Praying Hands.”
The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one–no one–ever makes it alone!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pitman/	“I’m Sorry,” comment from Marine Lieutenant General Chuck Pitman	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Lieutenant General Chuck Pitman
Semper Fi!

This ‘Letter of Apology’ was written by Lieutenant General Chuck Pitman, US Marine Corps, Retired:
For good and ill, the Iraqi prisoner abuse mess will remain an issue. On the one hand, right thinking Americans will abhor the stupidity of the actions while on the other hand, political glee will take control and fashion this minor event into some modern day massacre.
I humbly offer my opinion here:
I am sorry that the last seven times we Americans took up arms and sacrificed the blood of our youth; it was in the defense of Muslims ( Bosnia , Kosovo, Gulf War 1, Kuwait , etc.)
I am sorry that no such call for an apology upon the extremists came after 9/11.
I am sorry that all of the murderers on 9/11 were Islamic Arabs.
I am sorry that most Arabs and Muslims have to live in squalor under savage dictatorships.
I am sorry that their leaders squander their wealth.
I am sorry that their governments breed hate for the US in their religious schools, mosques, and government-controlled media.
I am sorry that Yasser Arafat was kicked out of every Arab country and high-jacked the Palestinian ’cause.’
I am sorry that no other Arab country will take in or offer more than a token amount of financial help to those same Palestinians.
I am sorry that the U. S. A. has to step in and be the biggest financial supporter of poverty stricken Arabs while the insanely wealthy Arabs blame the USA for all their problems.
I am sorry that our own left wing, our media, and our own brainwashed liberal masses do not understand any of this (from the misleading vocal elements of our society like radical liberal professors, CNN and the NY TIMES).
I am sorry the United Nations scammed the poor people of Iraq out of the ‘food for oil’ money so they could get rich while the common folk suffered.
I am sorry that some Arab governments pay the families of homicide bombers upon their death
I am sorry that those same bombers are brainwashed thinking they will receive 72 virgins in ‘paradise.’
I am sorry that the homicide bombers think pregnant women, babies, children, the elderly and other noncombatant civilians are legitimate targets.
I am sorry that our troops die to free more Arabs from the gang rape rooms and the filling of mass graves of dissidents of their own making.
I am sorry that Muslim extremists have killed more Arabs than any other group.
I am sorry that foreign trained terrorists are trying to seize control of Iraq and return it to a terrorist state.
I am sorry we don’t drop a few dozen Daisy cutters on Fallujah.
I am sorry every time terrorists hide they find a convenient ‘Holy Site.’
I am sorry they didn’t apologize for driving a jet into the World Trade Center that collapsed and severely damaged Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church – one of our Holy Sites.
I am sorry they didn’t apologize for flight 93 and 175, the USS Cole, the embassy bombings, the murders and beheadings of Nick Berg and Daniel Pearl, etc….etc!
I am sorry Michael Moore is American; he could feed a medium sized village in Africa
America will get past this latest absurdity. We will punish those responsible because that is what we do.
I am sorry that voters on the liberal left don’t understand the frightening changes that are taking place in the Muslim world and what these changes will do to this world in which we live.
I am sorry that Barack Hussein Obama may be elected president of the United States when he doesn’t have a clue on how to be a strong Commander-in-chief in a world filled with Muslim extremists who will do whatever it needs to do to destroy the lives of civilized people while killing innocent men, women and children in order to bring a change that is beneficial to all Islamic terrorists worldwide.
I am sorry that the Democratic Party has been highjacked by Socialists and Communists right under the very noses of those who take pride in calling themselves democrats.
We hang out our dirty laundry for the entire world to see. We move on. That’s one of the reasons we are hated so much. We don’t hide this stuff like all those Arab countries that are now demanding an apology.
Deep down inside, when most Americans saw this reported in the news, we were like – so what? We lost hundreds and made fun of a few prisoners. Sure, it was wrong, sure, it dramatically hurts our cause, but until captured we were trying to kill these same prisoners. Now we’re supposed to wring our hands because a few were humiliated?
Our compassion is tempered with the vivid memories of our own people killed, mutilated and burnt amongst a joyous crowd of celebrating Fallujahans.
If you want an apology from this American, you’re going to have a long wait! You have a better chance of finding those seventy-two virgins.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/heather-penney/	Pilot Was Ready to Take Down Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 By Ramming The Hijacked Airliner With Her F16 Jet Fighter	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Late in the morning of the Tuesday that changed everything, Lt. Heather “Lucky” Penney was on a runway at Andrews Air Force Base and ready to fly. She had her hand on the throttle of an F-16 and she had her orders: Bring down United Airlines Flight 93. The day’s fourth hijacked airliner seemed to be hurtling toward Washington. Penney, one of the first two combat pilots in the air that morning, was told to stop it.
The one thing she didn’t have as she roared into the crystalline sky was live ammunition. Or missiles. Or anything at all to throw at a hostile aircraft.
Except her own plane. So that was the plan.
Because the surprise attacks were unfolding, in that innocent age, faster than they could arm war planes, Penney and her commanding officer went up to fly their jets straight into a Boeing 757.
“We wouldn’t be shooting it down. We’d be ramming the aircraft,” Penney recalls of her charge that day. “I would essentially be a kamikaze pilot.”
For years, Penney, one of the first generation of female combat pilots in the country, gave no interviews about her experiences on Sept. 11 (which included, eventually, escorting Air Force One back into Washington’s suddenly highly restricted airspace).
But 10 years later, she is reflecting on one of the lesser-told tales of that endlessly examined morning: how the first counterpunch the U.S. military prepared to throw at the attackers was effectively a suicide mission.
“We had to protect the airspace any way we could,” she said last week in her office at Lockheed Martin, where she is a director in the F-35 program.


But none of her thousands of hours in the air quite compare with the urgent rush of launching on what was supposed to be a one-way flight to a midair collision.
First of her kind


“I signed up immediately,” she says. “I wanted to be a fighter pilot like my dad.””
On that Tuesday, they had just finished two weeks of air combat training in Nevada. They were sitting around a briefing table when someone looked in to say a plane had hit the World Trade Center in New York. When it happened once, they assumed it was some yahoo in a Cesna. When it happened again, they knew it was war.
But the surprise was complete. In the monumental confusion of those first hours, it was impossible to get clear orders. Nothing was ready. The jets were still equipped with dummy bullets from the training mission.
As remarkable as it seems now, there were no armed aircraft standing by and no system in place to scramble them over Washington. Before that morning, all eyes were looking outward, still scanning the old Cold War threat paths for planes and missiles coming over the polar ice cap.


Things are different today, Degnon says. At least two “hot-cocked” planes are ready at all times, their pilots never more than yards from the cockpit.
A third plane hit the Pentagon, and almost at once came word that a fourth plane could be on the way, maybe more. The jets would be armed within an hour, but somebody had to fly now, weapons or no weapons.
“Lucky, you’re coming with me,” barked Col. Marc Sasseville.
They were gearing up in the pre-flight life-support area when Sasseville, struggling into his flight suit, met her eye.
“I’m going to go for the cockpit,” Sasseville said.
She replied without hesitating. “I’ll take the tail.”
It was a plan. And a pact.
‘Let’s go!’
Penney had never scrambled a jet before. Normally the pre-flight is a half-hour or so of methodical checks. She automatically started going down the list.


She climbed in, rushed to power up the engines, screamed for her ground crew to pull the chocks. The crew chief still had his headphones plugged into the fuselage as she nudged the throttle forward. He ran along pulling safety pins from the jet as it moved forward.
She muttered a fighter pilot’s prayer — “God, don’t let me mess up” — and followed Sasseville into the sky.
They screamed over the smoldering Pentagon, heading northwest at more than 400 mph, flying low and scanning the clear horizon. Her commander had time to think about the best place to hit the enemy.


He also thought about his ejection seat. Would there be an instant just before impact?
“I was hoping to do both at the same time,” he says. “It probably wasn’t going to work, but that’s what I was hoping.”
Penney worried about missing the target if she tried to bail out.
“If you eject and your jet soars through without impact . . .” she trails off, the thought of failing more dreadful than the thought of dying.
But she didn’t have to die. She didn’t have to knock down an airliner full of kids and salesmen and girlfriends. They did that themselves.


“The real heroes are the passengers on Flight 93 who were willing to sacrifice themselves,” Penney says. “I was just an accidental witness to history.”


She’s a single mom of two girls now. She still loves to fly. And she still thinks often of that extraordinary ride down the runway a decade ago.
“I genuinely believed that was going to be the last time I took off,” she says. “If we did it right, this would be it.”

INSERT: After posting this photo, I went out of my room and told my mother the good news about okra, only to be told that my older brother Manong Boy has already been using it for a long time. This was corroborated by Amy, our housekeeper from Lanao although a Christian. She used to be assigned in my brother’s residence but she is now with us together with her 14-year old sister Yat. Amy said she was assigned to prepare every evening three glasses and place them at my brother’s bedside — a glass with cut okras, a glass with calamansi juice (made from a small citrus fruit), and a glass of water. But she said she cut the okra not at its ends but across its length. Okra is easily grown in tropical and temperate regions. Maybe we should share this knowledge with our FB friends in the colder regions, especially those in northern Europe and north America, who might not be so familiar with this surprisingly wonderful plant. I can vaguely remember that many years ago, I once wondered what vitamins and nutrients can be derived from a certain vegetable — I’m not so sure if it was okra or eggplant — because it looked so common. The most “praised” vegetables at home during my childhood days were the ampalaya (bitter melon or bitter gourd) and squash (it’s supposed to be good for eyesight). I didn’t like ampalaya at first — which child does? — but learned to take it regularly due to this childhood advertising or indoctrination My mother is interested too in herbals and medicinal plants. Her favorite drink is a tea made from ginger and turmeric — a very healthy drink indeed — something I also love to partake when available although never prepared myself. But she told me that a better drink is one composed of four types of gingers — the common ginger, turmeric and two not-so-common varieties.
A Repost: OKRA (LADY’S FINGER) JUICE CAN CURE DIABETES – FACTS ANALYSIS STORY: Lady Finger for Diabetes Please note that another name for Lady Finger is “OKRA “. Take two pieces of Lady Finger and remove/cut both ends of each Piece. Also put a small cut in the middle and put these two pieces in glass of water. Cover the glass and keep it at room temperature during night. Early morning, before breakfast simply remove two pieces of lady Finger from the glass and drink that water. Keep doing it on daily basis. Within two weeks, you will see remarkable results in reduction of your SUGAR. My sister has got rid of her diabetes. She was on Insulin for a few years, but after taking the lady fingers every morning for a few months, she has stopped Insulin but continues to take the lady fingers every day. But she chops the lady fingers into fine pieces in the night, adds the water and drinks it all up the next morning. Please. try it as it will not do you any harm even if it does not do much good to you, but U have to keep taking it for a few months before U see results, as most cases might be chronic. HOAX OR FACT: Fact. ANALYSIS: The message claims that drinking a glass of Lady finger (Okra) juice early in the morning can reduce the sugar levels in diabetic patients. It is a fact. The message appears to be taken from an article written in Articlesbase titled ‘Lady finger for diabetes’. The author says that he has learnt about this treatment of Sugar from a Television program. Okra is a healthy green vegetable with many other names like lady’s finger, bendi and gombo. It has several health benefits attributed to its superior fiber and mucilage content. These properties of Lady finger stabilize the blood sugar in a diabetic patient by controlling the rate at which sugar is absorbed from his intestinal tract. This anti-diabetic activity of Okra (lady finger) is proved both in Vitro (Laboratory) and Vivo (animal) studies. Both the studies published in scientific journals showed a gradual decrease in blood glucose levels with regular feeding of Okra. So if you are suffering from diabetes, it would be a good idea to check with your doctor and try this easy treatment at home. http://www.hoaxorfact.com/Health/okra-lady-s-finger-juice-can-cure-diabetes-facts-analysis.html

INSERT: After posting this photo, I went out of my room and told my mother the good news about okra, only to be told that my older brother Manong Boy has already been using it for a long time. This was corroborated by Amy, our housekeeper from Lanao although a Christian. She used to be assigned in my brother’s residence but she is now with us together with her 14-year old sister Yat. Amy said she was assigned to prepare every evening three glasses and place them at my brother’s bedside — a glass with cut okras, a glass with calamansi juice (made from a small citrus fruit), and a glass of water. But she said she cut the okra not at its ends but across its length. Okra is easily grown in tropical and temperate regions. Maybe we should share this knowledge with our FB friends in the colder regions, especially those in northern Europe and north America, who might not be so familiar with this surprisingly wonderful plant. I can vaguely remember that many years ago, I once wondered what vitamins and nutrients can be derived from a certain vegetable — I’m not so sure if it was okra or eggplant — because it looked so common. The most “praised” vegetables at home during my childhood days were the ampalaya (bitter melon or bitter gourd) and squash (it’s supposed to be good for eyesight). I didn’t like ampalaya at first — which child does? — but learned to take it regularly due to this childhood advertising or indoctrination My mother is interested too in herbals and medicinal plants. Her favorite drink is a tea made from ginger and turmeric — a very healthy drink indeed — something I also love to partake when available although never prepared myself. But she told me that a better drink is one composed of four types of gingers — the common ginger, turmeric and two not-so-common varieties.
A Repost: OKRA (LADY’S FINGER) JUICE CAN CURE DIABETES – FACTS ANALYSIS STORY: Lady Finger for Diabetes Please note that another name for Lady Finger is “OKRA “. Take two pieces of Lady Finger and remove/cut both ends of each Piece. Also put a small cut in the middle and put these two pieces in glass of water. Cover the glass and keep it at room temperature during night. Early morning, before breakfast simply remove two pieces of lady Finger from the glass and drink that water. Keep doing it on daily basis. Within two weeks, you will see remarkable results in reduction of your SUGAR. My sister has got rid of her diabetes. She was on Insulin for a few years, but after taking the lady fingers every morning for a few months, she has stopped Insulin but continues to take the lady fingers every day. But she chops the lady fingers into fine pieces in the night, adds the water and drinks it all up the next morning. Please. try it as it will not do you any harm even if it does not do much good to you, but U have to keep taking it for a few months before U see results, as most cases might be chronic. HOAX OR FACT: Fact. ANALYSIS: The message claims that drinking a glass of Lady finger (Okra) juice early in the morning can reduce the sugar levels in diabetic patients. It is a fact. The message appears to be taken from an article written in Articlesbase titled ‘Lady finger for diabetes’. The author says that he has learnt about this treatment of Sugar from a Television program. Okra is a healthy green vegetable with many other names like lady’s finger, bendi and gombo. It has several health benefits attributed to its superior fiber and mucilage content. These properties of Lady finger stabilize the blood sugar in a diabetic patient by controlling the rate at which sugar is absorbed from his intestinal tract. This anti-diabetic activity of Okra (lady finger) is proved both in Vitro (Laboratory) and Vivo (animal) studies. Both the studies published in scientific journals showed a gradual decrease in blood glucose levels with regular feeding of Okra. So if you are suffering from diabetes, it would be a good idea to check with your doctor and try this easy treatment at home.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/peta-biker-protester/	How Bikers Handle PETA Protesters	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" 
Johnstown, PA (GlossyNews) – Local and state police scoured the hills outside rural Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after reports of three animal rights activists going missing after attempting to protest the wearing of leather at a large motorcycle gang rally this weekend. Two others, previously reported missing, were discovered by fast food workers “duct taped inside fast food restaurant dumpsters,” according to police officials.
“Something just went wrong,” said a still visibly shaken organizer of the protest. “Something just went horribly, horribly, wrong.”
The organizer said a group of concerned animal rights activists, “growing tired of throwing fake blood and shouting profanities at older women wearing leather or fur coats,” decided to protest the annual motorcycle club event “in a hope to show them our outrage at their wanton use of leather in their clothing and motor bike seats.”
“In fact,” said the organizer, “motorcycle gangs are one of the biggest abusers of wearing leather, and we decided it was high time that we let them know that we disagree with them using it, ergo, they should stop.”
According to witnesses, protesters arrived at the event in a vintage 1960′s era Volkswagen van and began to pelt the gang members with balloons filled with red colored water, simulating blood, and shouting “you’re murderers” to passersby. This, evidently, is when the brouhaha began.
“They peed on me!!!” charged one activist. “They grabbed me, said I looked like I was French, started calling me ‘La Trene’ and duct taped me to a tree so they could pee on me all day!”
Still others claimed they were forced to eat hamburgers and hot dogs under duress. Those who resisted were allegedly held down while several bikers “farted on their heads.”
Police officials declined comments on any leads or arrests due to the ongoing nature of the investigation; however, organizers for the motorcycle club rally expressed “surprise” at the allegations.
“That’s preposterous, ”said one high-ranking member of the biker organizing committee. “We were having a party, and these people showed up and were very rude to us. They threw things at us, called us names, and tried to ruin the entire event. So, what did we do? We invited them to the party!
What could be more friendly than that? You know, just because we are all members of motorcycle clubs does not mean we do not care about inclusiveness. Personally, I think it shows a lack of character for them to be saying such nasty things about us after we bent over backwards to make them feel welcome.”
When confronted with the allegations of force-feeding the activist’s meat, using them as ad hoc latrines, leaving them incapacitated in fast food restaurant dumpsters, and ‘farting on their heads,’ the organizer declined to comment in detail. “That’s just our secret hand shake,” assured the organizer.

PEARL HARBOR
December 7th, 1941















On Sunday, December 7th, 1941 the Japanese launched a surprise attack against the U.S. Forces stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. By planning his attack on a Sunday, the Japanese commander Admiral Nagumo, hoped to catch the entire fleet in port. As luck would have it, the Aircraft Carriers and one of the Battleships were not in port. (The USS Enterprise was returning from Wake Island, where it had just delivered some aircraft. The USS Lexington was ferrying aircraft to Midway, and the USS Saratoga and USS Colorado were undergoing repairs in the United States.)
In spite of the latest intelligence reports about the missing aircraft carriers (his most important targets), Admiral Nagumo decided to continue the attack with his force of six carriers and 423 aircraft. At a range of 230 miles north of Oahu, he launched the first wave of a two-wave attack. Beginning at 0600 hours his first wave consisted of 183 fighters and torpedo bombers which struck at the fleet in Pearl Harbor and the airfields in Hickam, Kaneohe and Ewa. The second strike, launched at 0715 hours, consisted of 167 aircraft, which again struck at the same targets.
At 0753 hours the first wave consisting of 40 Nakajima B5N2 ‘Kate’ torpedo bombers, 51 Aichi D3A1 ‘Val’ dive bombers, 50 high altitude bombers and 43 Zeros struck airfields and Pearl Harbor Within the next hour, the second wave arrived and continued the attack.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/plimer-volcano/	Single Volcano Erased Years of Carbon Dioxide Reduction Efforts	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Iceland’s Volcanic Eruption vs Control of CO2 Emissions !!!!!  

July 18, 2011 at 9:34am

Ian Rutherford Plimer (born 12 February 1946) is an Australian geologist, academic and businessman, and professor of mining geology at the University of Adelaide.
You will appreciate his take on climate change (aka: global warming).
Professor Ian Plimer could not have said it better!
If you have read his book you will agree, this is a good summary.
Are you sitting down?
Okay, here’s the bombshell. The volcanic eruption in Iceland,
since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS, NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to control CO2 emissions on our planet – all of you.
Of course you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying to suppress – it’s that vital element that every plant requires to live and grow, and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans, and all animal life.
I know, it’s very disheartening to realize that all of the carbon
emission savings you have accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of –driving Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up until midnight to finish your kid’s “The Green Revolution” science project.
Throwing out all of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and speedboat, vacationing at home instead of overseas, nearly being hit every day riding your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs with $10.00 light bulbs . .. . well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days.
The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth’s atmosphere in just four days- yes – FOUR DAYS ONLY by that volcano in Iceland, has totally erased.

President Obama said that people should prioritize their family budgets and implied that cancelling luxuries like cable and cell phones to pay for their health insurance.
“I guess what I would say is, if you looked at that person’s budget and you looked at their cable bill, their…cell phone bill, other things that they’re spending on, it may turn out that, it’s just they haven’t prioritized health care, because right now, everybody’s healthy,” said President Obama. “Nobody actually wants to spend money on health insurance until they get sick. And then once their sick, the costs of not having health insurance are a lot worse than the costs of not having health insurance.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pope-francis-rowling-bible/	Pope Francis Asked J.K. Rowling to Write Bible	 Fiction!  & Satire!				2015/03/17	" Church Hires JK Rowling To Rewrite The Bible: 
 
The latest PR coup for Pope Francis has seen him hire famous and revered children’s author JK Rowling to rewrite the Bible.
It is hoped the author, most famous for her Harry Potter series, can make it more accessible and believable for a new generation of Catholics and Christians.
While the specifics of the rewrite are not yet known, it is believed Rowling is tasked with producing a compelling tale that young Catholics and Christians can engage with. Figures such as dementors and other popular creations may take the place of less realistic Biblical creatures such as unicorns and the leviathon.
“We are very happy Miss Rowling has agreed to the rewrite, we keenly await the first draft,” a Vatican insider told WWN.
Rowling’s selection has raised some eyebrows but the decision by Pope Francis to select the wildly popular author is mainly due to commercial concerns.
“The sales of the Jesus Christ action figure have dropped by over 200% in the last 10 years, we are in need of new, compelling and toy-friendly characters…like the dinosaur in Toy Story,” a source close to the Pope told WWN.
“Our revenue streams are shrinking so the more Hollywood-esque the better,” the source concluded.
Rowling has thus far remained tight lipped on her vision for the Bible and its merry band of characters but a number of Hollywood producers are in discussions to turn it into a movie.
In the last century many Christian leaders have offered revisions on the interpretations of many of the Bible’s passages but Rowling is expected to take a more drastic approach.
“Judas is probably going to wear a leather jacket and JK is toying with the idea of a nervous twitch or even an eye-patch. Also why have one book when can have more? She is thinking of splitting it up into 9, maybe 10 books” the author’s publicist shared with WWN.

We don’t know why John Paul II wanted to hide this picture for years. The Vatican published this picture recently, for first time. This picture was taken by one of his security guards just when the Pope was attacked and was falling down in his pope mobile. U can see the pain in his face.
 
Joaquin Navarro Valls, who is the one spokesman from The Vatican, said that they made a lot of studies for years of this incredible picture and of course about the quality of the developing of the picture because when it was developed nobody could see very well because the image was
not clear. Finally, and after so many controls and being looking and checking by all the experts in photography (around the world), they decided that there were no tricks in it and today they give us this beautiful gift from our Mother of God.
You can see the Mother of God holding John Paul II in her arms. Beautiful right?

Extremely Rare And Beautiful Pink Dolphin Spotted
Picture provided by: by Capt. Erik Rue of Calcasieu Charter Service

 
This extremely rare and beautiful “pink dolphin” was spotted and photographed by Capt. Erik Rue of Calcasieu Charter Service on June 24th, 2007 during a charter fishing trip on Calcasieu Lake south of Lake Charles, LA.
It appears to be an uncanny freak of nature, an albino dolphin, with reddish eyes and glossy pink skin. It is small in comparison to the others it is traveling with and appears to be a youngster traveling with mama. After spotting the beautiful mammal cruising with a pod of four other dolphins, Rue and his guests Randy and Peyton Smith and Greg and Sam Elias of Monroe, LA idled nearby while watching and photographing the unusual sight for more than an hour.
Our expectations are high that we will see this amazing mammal again as it was in an area frequented by the gentle mammals and one confirmed report has it being spotted at least a month earlier in a nearby location. If it does turn up again, it will be a welcome surprise to our guests.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/odin-swimming-tiger/	Odin The Swimming White Bengal Tiger	Truth!				2015/03/17	"These incredible photos of a White Bengal Tiger named Odin.  Odin is six years old and 10 feet long from tail to nose. Odin lives at a Zoo in Vallejo, California, near San Francisco. Odin with his British trainer Lee Munro . Odin was hand-raised at the zoo. And after he was weaned, his British trainer Lee Munro discovered his remarkable skill. When a lump of meat was thrown into a pool of water, Odin would happily dive in after it. He makes a funny face – and it’s actually to close his nostrils to stop the water from going into his nose.
                              
Not all big cats enjoy the water but for Tigers from the hot climate of South-East Asia it’s one way to cool down. Plus they hunt in and around water. They’re an ambush predator so they wait for prey to come down to the water. When you actually see him dive underwater he looks so graceful, Odin loves the water and he loves food, he said. “Not all big cats will dive and swim underwater even for meat treats.”
Munro said tigers were the most powerful swimmers out of all land-dwelling animals. Tragically, within our lifetimes, zoos might be the only places left to see these magnificent animals. A century ago there were about 100,000 tigers in the wild. Now there are just 2,500 adults, with the Bengal variety almost extinct. None has been seen in the wild since the last white tiger was shot and killed in 1958. White tigers are the most rare. They get their white color from an unusual and extremely rare genetic combination.

I hope you enjoyed these photos.

Paul Smith, the man with extraordinary talent was born in Philadelphia on September 21, 1921 with severe cerebral palsy.  Not only had Paul beaten the odds of a life with spastic cerebral palsy, a disability that impeded his speech & mobility but also taught himself to become a master artist as well as a terrific chess player even after being devoid of a formal education as a child.
When typing, Paul used his left hand to steady his right one. Since he couldn’t press two keys at the same time, he almost always locked the shift key down and made his pictures using the symbols at the top of the number keys. In other words, his pictures were based on these characters …. @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ .
Across seven decades, Paul created hundreds of pictures. He often gave the originals away. Sometimes, but not always, he kept or received a copy for his own records.
As his mastery of the typewriter grew, he developed techniques to create shadings, colors, and textures that made his work resemble pencil or charcoal drawings.”
This great man passed away on June 25, 2007, but left behind a collection of his amazing artwork that will be an inspiration for many.

In a zoo in California , a mother tiger gave birth to a rare set of triplet tiger cubs. Unfortunately, due to complications in the pregnancy, the cubs were born prematurely and due to their tiny size, they died shortly after birth.
The mother tiger after recovering from the delivery, suddenly started to decline in health,
although physically she was fine. The veterinarians felt that the loss of her litter had caused the tigress to fall into a depression. The doctors decided that if the tigress could surrogate another mother’s cubs, perhaps she would improve.
After checking with many other zoos across the country, the depressing news was that there were no tiger cubs of the right age to introduce to the mourning mother. The veterinarians decided to try something that had never been tried in a zoo environment. Sometimes a mother of one species will take on the care of a different species. The only orphans that could be found quickly, were a litter of weanling pigs. The zoo keepers and vets wrapped the piglets in tiger skin and placed the babies around the mother tiger. Would they become cubs or pork chops?
Take a look…you won’t believe your eyes

OCEAN SHORES, WASHINGTON
While the ocean vessel ‘Dawn Raider’ was commercial fishing for dogfish, this Great White Shark was hooked in the mouth. It only resisted slightly for 15 minutes before it came up alongside the boat to have a look; just long enough for one of the crew members to slip a rope a round it’s tail !!! ‘And that’s when the fun began.

The Shark took off towing the 42 foot fishing boat backwards through the water at an estimated 7 knots. Just like in JAWS, the boat was taking on water over the stern and the crew watched in horror as the shark would actually jump completely out of the water at times. This went on for an hour before the shark finally drowned.
She weighed in at 1035 LBS. It is suspected she followed a weak El Nino current into local Washington waters in search of food. Although mid 60 degree water is considered ideal for these sharks, the larger ones can tolerate water in the low 50s.

Wrong! this dirt road is 57 mile alright; the fastest you can go is 25 mph; you do the math!!! So, after this long drive you get the good news it is $75.00 a person!!
Chris said maybe we should forget it; I said after that road we are not coming back so get out the damn credit card out. Then you get on their bus for a 10 min ride to the “walkway”; built in one of the ugliest place on the whole Grand Canyon; not a tree to be seen and the water is gray below! Their building is not started, so you have a trailer to go into to go through a metal detector and leave your camera and purse in the trailer. The walkway glass was cracked which lead me to believe they may have a few engineering
glitches and I got my ass off the thing right away after seeing that! Believe me it is not as big or long as it looks on TV. They do give you a buffet lunch, with your ticket, at Guano” (means poop) Point. The Indians used to go over the cliff here to pick up bird shit to use for Makeup (war paint). You  get to sit in one of the windiest places on earth to eat your chicken or ribs covered with blowing dirt. We passed on the lunch. There are buses leaving every 10-15 min with 52 people on board at $75.00 per person $3,900.00 per bus from 8:00 am until 6:30 pm. That’s $156,000.00 per day! I guess they aremaking a lot of money. They are flying people in from Vegas and Laughlin to go see this thing! I guess the Indians are smart; but not so honest about all the details of the activity. We had to stop and change a tire for a young girl who took her grandparents out there. They had the right kind of car and good tires; but the road is terrible, they blew out the side wall of the tire. They must have hit the side of the road and a big rock. They did not know where the spare tire was and were completely helpless. The tow truck would have come out there but it would have been 2.5 hours and  $400.00! The girl was very scared and grateful we stopped to help. Some guys stopped to ask if this was the right way to the Skywalk. Grandpa yelled out go
back it is not worth it!! One last detail, the hotel the Indians run to accommodate this adventure looks great online, but the sign at check in says “SINCE THE TRAINS COME BY EVERY 10 -15 MINS, PLEASE ASK FOR THE FREE EAR
PLUGS”.  We immediately canceled our reservations and made it to Kingman , AZ for the night. We got up at 6am and got the hell out of Arizona

July 28-29, 2014 — USS Seawolf missile shot down TWA 800
By Wayne Madsen
 

According to a senior member of the staff of then-Secretary of the Navy John Dalton, the test firing of a new generation Navy missile from the submarine USS Seawolf accidentally struck TWA flight 800 en route from New York to Paris on July 17, 1996. According to the former Navy official, the missile test was so important for the Clinton administration, it was being shown live on a Navy closed-circuit television feed at the White House. The Seawolf’s missile was to have struck a drone reportedly being towed by a Navy P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft. However, to the horror of the Navy personnel involved with the test and senior White House staff gathered to witness the missile’s successful launching, it veered off course and intercepted the TWA 800 Boeing 747, killing the 230 passengers and crew on board the aircraft.
ABC News Paris correspondent and former John F. Kennedy Press Secretary and U.S. Senator Pierre Salinger reported that a U.S. Navy missile, according to his sources, had downed TWA 800. A vicious smear campaign was launched against Salinger and he was eventually fired by ABC. This editor subsequently spoke at length with Salinger about both TWA 800 and Pan Am 103. We agreed that the investigations of both involved U.S. government cover-ups.
The Seawolf, which had recently completed sea trials but had not yet been fully commissioned into service, was participating in a major Navy exercise off Long Island in exercise area W-105. The exercise was dubbed GLOBAL YANKEE ’96. Ironically, the Seawolf was to be commissioned in Groton, Connecticut on July 17, 1997, the anniversary of the shooting down of TWA 800, but the Navy, sensitive to the date, altered the commissioning to July 19, two days later. Margaret Dalton, the wife of Navy Secretary John Dalton, carried out the submarine’s commissioning sponsorship in Groton.
The FBI initially believed that terrorism was the cause of the crash of TWA 800 and it ran a criminal investigation parallel to that of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). However, as the need to cover-up the missile angle became paramount, the FBI changed modes and began harassing witnesses who clearly saw a bright streak or arc in the sky moments before the massive explosion tore apart the Boeing 747 sending bodies and debris into the Atlantic Ocean. Two Air National Guard Blackhawk helicopter pilots saw an orange-red streak prior to the fireball while conducting helicopter training approaches at nearby Gabreski Field.
But the missile theory never could be put to rest. Senator Alphonse d’Amato (R-NY) said he believed a missile struck TWA 800, as did a number of individuals with military and flight experience. D’Amato served on the President’s Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST), which was set up in September 1989 to make aviation security recommendations after the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. In 1993, D’Amato opposed funding any more Seawolf submarines, however, as they were built by the Groton, Connecticut-based Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, the two Connecticut senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd, were strong proponents of the submarines the Navy said they did not even need in the post-Cold War era.
The unfolding events surrounding the Seawolf’s missile impact on TWA 800 was witnessed in real-time in the White House Situation Room by startled officials who were viewing what was suppose have been a successful intercept of a drone. However, according to our Secretary of the Navy senior staff source, as the impact of what transpired dawned on White House officials, the director of the White House Situation Room, Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, immediately ordered the mobilization of Navy and other military assets to cover up the Navy’s role in the disaster. As the National Security Council’s director of Systems and Planning, Cosgriff was partly responsible for obtaining the White House Situation Room to show-off the Navy’s latest missile capabilities to gathered civilian and military officials.
The crew of the P-3 that was towing the drone was immediately transferred to new assignments. The P-3’s number 3 engine showed signs of damage from the explosion of TWA 800 and maintenance records on the engine were suppressed by the Navy. Three other submarines participating in GLOBAL YANKEE ’96 were also ordered out of the area. They were the USS Albuquerque, the USS Augusta, and the USS Trepang. The FBI accounted for all missiles aboard the three submarines but not those on board the Seawolf, which was not yet officially commissioned into service and which had just completed it sea trials a little over a week earlier.
Our source confirmed that US Navy SEAL team members were dispatched to recover TWA 800 wreckage with the sole intent being the alteration of the debris to fit the story of a defective fuel tank explosion. Two U.S. Navy salvage ships, the USS Grasp and USS Grapple, were sent to Long Island waters to recover TWA wreckage.
In 2000, conservative pundit Reed Irvine confirmed what Salinger had reported four years earlier. Irvine reported that he recorded an interview with a Navy petty officer who was on the deck of a submarine near where TWA 800 was hit by the missile. The petty officer told Irvine that he was “underneath TWA 800 when he saw a missile hit it and the 747 explode overhead.”
Irvine also wrote, “There are hundreds of Navy and Coast Guard personnel, as well as some FBI, CIA, FAA, NTSB and former White House employees who know that the real cause of the crash of TWA 800 was papered over with a tissue of lies. Two of them, James Kallstrom and George Stephanopoulos, have made statements that indicate an official cover-up. Stephanopoulos, a Clinton adviser who is now an ABC News correspondent, mentioned on the air a secret meeting in the White House situation room ‘in the aftermath of the TWA 800 bombing.’ Kallstrom, who headed the FBI’s TWA 800 investigation, told me – and I have this on tape – that three radar targets close to the crash site were Navy vessels on a classified maneuver. We know they were submarines because the radar tracks disappeared when TWA 800 crashed.”
One of the submarine’s that was ordered to immediately leave the area of the TWA crash was the Seawolf. The Seawolf was testing a missile that could be fired on an enemy aircraft while the submarine was fully submerged. The Navy ordered all radar data of the incident seized. The Navy and other U.S. agencies subsequently altered data tapes to be consistent with the NTSB’s contrived conclusion that TWA 800 was brought down by a spontaneous explosion in the center wing fuel tank. Radar tapes showing the P-3 at 20,000 feet and a towed drone at 17,600 feet at about a mile behind the P-3 were erased.

The CIA developed an animation to bolster the center wing fuel tank explosion explanation.
The Seawolf’s Cooperative Engagement Capability, which linked its weapon systems with the Aegis radar systems installed on other Navy ships participating in the exercise, also saw its data purged. Once the subsurface missile was launched, the Seawolf’s combat software no longer had control over the missile.
The Navy’s Aegis training platform, the Combat System Engineering Development Site (CSEDS), located in the middle of a cornfield in Moorestown, New Jersey, off of the New Jersey Turnpike, which had a AEGIS SPY-1 radar window off Long Island, also saw its data tapes confiscated as did the Federal Aviation Administration control center in Islip, Long Island and the FAA technical center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. A Lockheed-Martin engineer who worked at CSEDS in Moorestown said the SPY-1 radar was reported to be “down for maintenance” during the exercise, an exercise in which it was to have been a participant.
The NTSB falsified data in their cover-up, billed as an investigation. The Flight Data Recorder’s indication that something struck the Boeing 747 was brushed aside.
Hank Hughes, a former senior NTSB accident investigator, revealed in 2013 that evidence that a “high-velocity debris exiting the right side of the aircraft.” Hughes said evidence was tampered with. Other NTSB investigators joined Hughes in criticizing the NTSB’s “accident” report. Testing done by the Brookhaven and Sandia National Laboratories could yield no evidence that TWA 800 was brought down as the result of a mechanical failure.
Researchers were able to piece together the following timeline of events from open source information:
20:31:11 Intact and climbing 747 approaches 13,800 feet.
20:31:12 U.S. Navy subsurface-launched missile impacts TWA 800 at 13,800 feet. Beginning of decapitation process.
20:31:47 Massive fireball explodes in the falling wreckage at 7500 feet.
20:31:43 Wreckage begins hitting the water’s surface.
20:31:55-20:31:57 splashdown of the massive fireball flames.
A number of observers witnessed a subsurface wake after the explosion of TWA 800. The Seawolf, if ordered out of the area at maximum speed, is capable of doing over 35 knots submerged. At such a speed, a visible surface wake is very possible. The pilot of a Cessna reported seeing a distinct subsurface wake in addition to a passenger on board US Air flight 277.
The Navy continues to classify a “design deficiency” discovered during the Seawolf’s Weapons Systems Accuracy Trials (WSAT) conducted in 1998. In addition, the November 1999 Operational Assessment report cited six critical operational issues as high risk for Seawolf. The second issue on the Navy’s list was the submarine’s “weapon launch, handling, and stowage.”

Jeri Wright Has Direct Ties with President Obama"	Unproven!				2015/03/17	" ‘Chickens Come Home to Roost’ – Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s Daughter Convicted on 11 Counts of Fraud 

Photo by AP

In September Jeri Wright, daughter of Reverend “God Damn America” Wright, and 12 other Democrats were charged with embezzling $16 million in Federal health grants that should have gone to AIDS charities and other programs for the poor and needy.
More than one of the defendants had direct ties to President Barack Obama.
On Friday Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s daugher was found guilty of eleven counts that included money laundering and lying to federal agents.
Breitbart reported:
On Friday, a federal jury took less than two hours to convict the daughter of President Barack Obama’s controversial former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, of fraud.
Jeri Wright was found guilty of a fraud scheme that siphoned thousands of taxpayer dollars intended for a not-for-profit work and education program known as We Are Our Brother’s Keeper.
Prosecutor Timothy Bass said Jeri Wright lied “over and over” and went on a “spending spree” that included traveling to Las Vegas, buying vehicles, and remodeling her basement with cash from the money laundering scheme.
She was found guilty on all counts.
“If you take and misuse government money, and then lie about it, you will be held accountable in a court of law,” said U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois, Jim Lewis.

East Rutherford — In a bit of an ironic scenario, New York Jets football player Michael Vick was attacked by a pitbull as he left MetLife Stadium this Saturday (March 22, 2014).
The 34-year-old quarterback was leaving the stadium after visiting with his new team’s management, when a stray pitbull suddenly darted towards him. Onlookers say the dog gave chase as Vick attempted to use some of his classic juke moves to avoid it. Unswayed by Vick’s attempts to elude him, the dog locked onto his left thigh. The dog shook violently back and forth while locked on to Vick’s leg.
According to numerous bystanders, Vick let out high-pitched screams of agony as the dog continued to attack him. The dog was successfully pried from the veteran quarterbacks leg after an agonizing 10 minutes.
Michael Vick was treated at a nearby hospital, and received over 45 stitches. Vick will undergo an MRI on Monday to determine if there is any internal damage. It is unknown if the QB will be ready for training camp, which is set to begin in August.

Gerard Couzens in Madrid
Sunday March 30, 2008
The Observer
Chaining up a dog and forcing it to go without food and water in the name of art is a surefire way of making yourself unpopular with animal lovers. The furore created by Damien Hirst’s pickled sheep and Tracey Emin’s dirty bed pales into insignificance against the international outrage Guillermo ‘Habacuc’ Vargas has unleashed.
The Costa Rican has been called an animal abuser, killer and worse over claims that a stray dog called Natividad died of starvation after he displayed it at an exhibition last year at the Códice Gallery in Managua, Nicaragua. Vargas tethered the animal without food and water under the words ‘Eres Lo Que Lees’ – ‘You Are What You Read’ – made out of dog biscuits while he played the Sandinista anthem backwards and set 175 pieces of crack cocaine alight in a massive incense burner. More than a million people have signed an online petition urging organisers of this year’s event to stop Vargas taking part.
Vargas, 32, said he wanted to test the public’s reaction, and insisted none of the exhibition visitors intervened to stop the animal’s suffering. He refused to say whether the animal had survived the show, but said he had received dozens of death threats.
Juanita Bermúdez, director of the Códice Gallery, insisted Natividad escaped after just one day. She said: ‘It was untied all the time except for the three hours the exhibition lasted and it was fed regularly with dog food Habacuc himself brought in.’

Generic Wellbutrin got yet another knock for lack of bioequivalence. This time, however, the FDA found that a 300mg tablet made by Actavis was the problem.
Regulatory Focus reports that the FDA posted a note on its website dated Oct. 10 that found the generic antidepressant was not the bioequivalent of GlaxoSmithKline’s Wellbutrin. The FDA said the Actavis formulation “had different formulation design as the reference product so that the generic product releases earlier in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.”
The FDA found a Wellbutrin generic made by Impax and distributed by Teva failed the bioequivalence tests in 2012. This finding was based on reports that started to flow into the regulator in 2007.

It appears this guy shot Brown several times in “non-lethal” areas trying to stop him. Otherwise why would he have been shot so many times in the arm and side?
……..and after he had been hit in the head by this “gentle giant”!!!
You won’t see much defense of this cop by the media. They like “race” stories better than “all of the story” or “objective reporting”.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/wal-mart-flipflops/	Skin Injuries from Flip Flops Purchased at WalMart	Truth!				2015/03/17	"PLEASE READ! I WOULDN’T WANT THIS HAPPEN TO ANY OF YOU! CHERYL
Hi all! For those of you who don’t know, I used to work at Walmart for a short time, but quit
Before I quit though I did buy a pair of cheepie flip flops to wear over a weekend trip to the beach, Long Boat Key April 20th to be exact.
I actually got the stupid shoes with a picture in mind then I wore them a few times

these are the actual flip flops

This is the picture I had in mind (I bought 2 pair that day)
Well, after wearing them my feet would be red and sort of tingly, but I figured that it was just because it was first flip flops of the year so my feet need to get used to them. Blabity blabity… Well I have now had this chemical burn for 11 days, (As of July 3rd) I really thought it would just go away on it’s own. It is absolutely going away very well at all…this started on June 22nd 2007 and has just gotten worse basically. I have only worn those shoes 15 minutes here, half an hour there, hour there…and so on, NOT enough time to burn my feet like this!
I apologize for you having to look at my feet, really….. sorry!

 
this is the first picture I really thought to take, what you can’t really tell is how swollen the red part is…UUUGGGH! this was Jun 28, 2007 9:00 PM 6 days into it
—
[Truthorfiction.com note: there are numerous pictures of a more graphic nature, click  here to view the rest of the article.] 
—
I have worked very hard to remove the scabs…I know that is so gross, but it’s a fact, anyhow, this is what my feet look like today (Friday) as of 8pm. They still hurt, and I can still only
put on my old beat up tennis shoes, not my tennis shoes that I like, I tried & it about made me cry! But the good news is that this is finally getting so much better! It looks great huh?!
(sad part is, I am actually serious)
I will be updating this page as I need to but I really will keep it updated.
I am wondering just how much this is going to scar? I will be glad when this is over.
7-6-07 Under advisement of my attorney I have boxed up the actual offending flip flops and tucked them away in a safe place.
THE STORY
Like I said I got these stupid shoes for a picture, then ended up wearing the yellow ones and got all these burns on my feet from them.
7/2/07 I tried to alert Walmart to a possible problem so that no little kids might end up with this (it hurts after all!)
The only reason I didn’t buy MY OWN son a pair of these is because I thought he would not be able to walk well in them, he is only 3 after all.
I called the home office and nicely explained that I used to be an employee, and I bought the shoes, and I just want to make sure that no kids were hurt…bla bla. The home office was pretty decent about the entire thing. Then the store in Summerfield called, July 2nd 1:44 pm and left a voicemail, They told me I had to come in. The GM (Richard) told me who to talk with the training manager (Mike Sidel) and
when he would be in. He (Richard) seems to be a nice guy. I went in 15 minutes to a half an hour after getting the voicemail. I thought it was important to go in there.
I couldn’t believe how rude and mean, and obnoxious Mike was to me, he acted like I was making it all up, I tried to show him my injuries so he would take it a bit more seriously
& he turned his head away so that he could say he never saw it. Infact, everyone in the office was acting as if I were the “bad guy” I told him the details and he filled out a report. He asked me,
“well, what do you want me to do about this?” I told him that “if there was infact a problem with the shoes that I wanted to make sure someone knows so this doesn’t happen to anyone else” .
He told me “well, nothing will come of this because you bought them in April and you are just now reporting this?”
When I tried to explain the timeline to him he didn’t want to listen and turned his back on me so I just quit talking.
I never used to think so but now I really feel like Walmart is a horrible company. You would have to been there but it was almost as if since I was a former employee, he was going out of his way to try
and be mean to me. I have heard this is a common Walmart practice, but I didn’t really believe it til now.
After he filled out the incident report I had to ask for a copy as he didn’t seem to want to give me one. I then took on the stance that I wasn’t leaving until I got a copy so he made me a copy.
I limped out of the store and went home, a bit shocked and a lot disgusted.
All I wanted to do was let them know that there might be a problem with some Chinese made shoes since I am not allergic to latex or rubber. I have always worn rubber flip flops like this and never
had any type of problem. I am not a sue happy type person but automatically he was defensive and basically acted like a complete jerk to me. So now I have decided to let every single person who will listen know exactly what happened to my feet and how a representative of Walmart acted toward me.
We’ll see what happens next.
I spent hours on the phone trying to get a doctor’s appointment and finally
7/3/07 I went to the doctor today, it was actually a community clinic where the poor people go, I am fairly poor so this I thought would be fine. After answering several very personal
and inappropriate questions and a five hour wait
she said it was “defiantly from the flip flops”
(but then you’d be hard pressed to think otherwise huh?)
She also said it may scar and gave me some cream that doesn’t seem to be doing alot for it.
Anyhow, while I was at the doctors The insurance company for Walmart called and left a voicemail for me (You can play it on the top of the Page)

this is my dog, he has nothing to do with this, but he’s cute huh?
Update July 9 2007
I just got an email from a girl saying that she had the same problem
I took out her email addy to protect her, but otherwise I just copied & pasted her email

My name is Holly and my feet have the same marks on them as yours. I have had this problem for 5 weeks now.
My feet itch like they have a yeast infection. It is awful!!! I saw your question on Yahoo Answers.
I paid $2.88 for my flip flops at Wal mart. They are rubber with a bright pink strap, and a yellow bottom with white flowers on the base.
I would like to contact the FDA also; how do I do that?
Sincerely,
Holly XXXX
Click here for my original post, notice the LACK on info that I put in the post about the flip flops? She emailed me and described perfectly the flip flops.
She has described the flip flops to a T, the ones that burnt my feet are yellow with pink straps. The very same as she is describing so I am going to try to help this girl to.
7-9-07 9pm I talked with Holly, it is like hearing me tell the story, her situation is nearly identical to mine, she even bought her flip flops right around the same time as me, mid to end of April.
(you have to wonder if it wasn’t a bad batch huh?)
I couldn’t believe it, her story is the SAME, I posted another question on yahoo answers hoping to find more people that this may have happened to, I know Holly & I aren’t the only ones out there.
7/9/07 I spent some more hours on the phone today trying to get another doctor’s appointment because my feet are getting worse, It isn’t a rash so that stupid cream is not doing anything at all. I have been told no appointment til October, we don’t even see people who are uninsured, we are not taking any new patients at this time…I have heard it all today.
But I finally found an urgent care place that is the low low price of $135.00 I felt like I hit the lotto!
So I jumped in the car and went there, and will have her final report later this week, she said that it is a reaction from the flip flops, and she has never seen anything like that. I was given 10 days worth of antibiotics, and a script for steroids which I will have filled tomorrow. My feet are killing me, I am walking on the sides of them because the skin rips open if I try to walk on them like normal. Holly pointed something interesting out to me, This is not a rash, it is a burn, but if this were a rash, it would have spread beyond the lines of the straps by now, so far, the only skin affected by this “reaction” is exactly where the straps were. A rash simply does not behave this way. Thank You Holly, I am for some reason having a hard time getting people’s attention to the fact that it is not a rash, you worded it perfectly.
This is the letter I got from Walmart so far
 

So what, I am supposed to call China?? Because the product that Walmart sold me burnt my feet?!
I just found out that CMI is actually Sam’s Club/Wal-mart’s self-insurance company.
“Any reimbursement adversely affects Wal-mart’s bottom line, and they have figured out that most people will not take the time to sue them ” Go figure huh?
It looks as if Walmart has an agreement with the supplier that they are responsible for any stuff like this so I betchya both
Walmart and CMI have to be named on any legal action.
Ya know, Walmart has the responsibility to their consumers to sell stuff that, albeit cheep, is SAFE to their consumers, but it almost looks like passing the buck.
But ya know, one could argue, at what point is Walmart negligent? I think we have already crossed that line….

I absolutely can not believe it, they never even checked into it…..I thought I would go in since I can kind of walk now, but honestly,
I thought these shoes would not still be on the shelves. WHY are they still on the shelves when they can’t be sure they are safe??
CONTACT ME!
If ANYONE has now or has had a problem with flip flops purchased in April 2007
and have the pictures & documentation to prove it contact me or The consumer protection agency , and get a lawyer.

These 11 States now have More People on Welfare than they do Employed! Last month, the Senate Budget Committee reports that in fiscal year 2012, between food stamps, housing support, child care, Medicaid and other benefits, the average U.S. Household below the poverty line received $168.00 a day in government support.
What’s the problem with that much support? Well, the median household income in America is just over $50,000, which averages out to $137.13 a day. To put it another way, being on welfare now pays the equivalent of $30.00 an hour for a 40-hour week, while the average job pays $20.00 an hour.

Yesterday, I left at 10am with the iPhone in my left FRONT pocket of my suit pants. I drove 4 hours to a wedding, which also involved a lot of sitting during dinner etc but also 2-3 hours of dancing. I left at 2am and went to bed, driving home 4 hours back.

Re: Watch your back.
Hello mufcadnan123!


You don’t need to “find” me. My address is 9175 Kornbrust Circle, Lone Tree, CO 80124.
Luckily for you, there are daily DIRECT FLIGHTS from Heathrow to Denver . Here’s what you will need to do. After arriving at Denver and passing through customs, you will need to catch the shuttle to the rental car facility. Once in your rental car, take Pena Boulevard to I-225 south. Proceed on I-225 south to I-25 south. Proceed south on I-25 to Lincoln Avenue which is exit 193. Turn right (west) onto Lincoln . Proceed west to the fourth light, and turn left (south) onto Ridgegate Boulevard . Proceed south, through the roundabout to Kornbrust Drive . Turn left onto Kornbrust Drive and then take an immediate right onto Kornbrust Circle . I’m at 9175.
Just do me one favor. PLEASE wear body armor. I have some new ammunition that I want to try out, and frankly, close-quarter body shots without armor would feel almost unsporting from my perspective. That and the fact that I’m probably carrying a good 50 I.Q. points on you makes it morally incumbent upon me to spot you a tactical advantage.
However, being that you are a miserable, trembling coward, I realize that you probably are incapable of actually following up on any of your threats without losing control of your bowels and crapping your pants while simultaneously sobbing yourself into hyperventilation. So, how about this: why don’t you contact the main mosque here in Denver and see if some of the local musloids here in town would be willing to carry out your attack for you?
After all, this is what your “perfect man” mohamed did (pig excrement be upon him). You see, mohamed, being a miserable coward and a con artist, would send other men into battle to fight on his behalf. Mohamed would stay at the BACK of the pack and let the stupid, ignorant suckers like you that he had conned into his political cult do the actual fighting and dying. Mohamed would then fornicate with the dead men’s wives and children. You should follow mohamed’s example! Here is the contact info for the main mosque here in Denver :
Masjid Abu Bakr
Imam Karim Abu Zaid
2071 South Parker Road
Denver, CO 80231
Phone: 303-696-9800
Email: denvermosque@yahoo.com
I’m sure they would be delighted to hear from you. Frankly, I’m terribly disappointed that not a SINGLE musloid here in the United States has made ANY attempt to rape and behead me. But maybe I haven’t made myself clear enough, so let me do that right now.






I will NEVER, EVER, EVER submit to islam. I will fight islam with every fiber of my being for as long as I live because islam is pure satanic evil. If you are really serious about islam dominating the United States and the world, you are going to have to come through me. You are going to have to kill me. Good luck with that. And understand that if you or some of your musloid boyfriends do actually manage to kill me, The Final Crusade will officially commence five minutes later, and then, despite your genetic mental retardation, you will be made to understand with crystal clarity what the word “defeat” means. Either way, I win, so come and get it.
Deo adjuvante non timendum (with the help of God there is nothing to be afraid of).

U.S. Postal Service to Unveil Stamp Honoring Known Sexual Predator

A drag queen was behind USPS Harvey Milk stamp
May 27, 2014
With last week’s release of the Harvey Milk postage stamp by the United States Postal Service, AFA wants you to know the truth behind it.
The Harvey Milk stamp was a result of seven years of lobbying by a self-described drag queen (a biologi cal man with implanted breasts) and former transsexual prostitute Nicole Murray Ramirez of San Diego.
Honoring predator Harvey Milk on a U.S. postage stamp is disturbing to say the least. Harvey Milk was a very disreputable man and used his charm and power to prey on young boys with emotional problems and drug addiction. He is the last person we should be featuring on a stamp.
Note the hypocrisy of the postal service’s “Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee,” which claims it “commemorates positive contributions to American life, history, and culture,” but specifically states st amps “shall not be issued to honor religious institutions or individuals whose principal achievements are associated with religious undertakings or beliefs.”
Randy Shilts, a homosexual San Francisco Chronicle reporter, wrote a favorable and sordid biography of Milk in “The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk.”
According to Shilts, Milk repeatedly engaged in adult-child sex and advocated for multiple homosexual relationships at the same time.
Unfortunately, the deed is done. The United States Postal Service honored a child predator at the whim of a drag queen. Read AFA’s press release here.
Furthermore, the radical homosexual lobby will undoubtedly encourage businesses to use these stamps – all in the name of inclusiveness, political correctness and diversity. This is not diversity; this is perversity.
What you can do…
1. Refuse to accept the Harvey Milk stamp if offered by your local post office. Instead, ask for a stamp of the United States flag.
2. Refuse to accept mail at your home or business if it is postmarked with the Harvey Milk stamp. Simply write ‘Return to Sender” on the envelope and tell your postman you won’t accept it.

American Family Association Denounces Decision to Praise Known Pederast Harvey Milk
Countless American heroes have been featured on U.S. postage stamps, from presidents, suffragists and abolitionists to inspiring sports stars and groundbreaking artists and musicians.
But next month, another famous—or infamous name—will be added to their ranks: Harvey Milk.
Milk’s claim to fame was that he was the first openly gay politician to run successfully for public office in California, but Milk’s sordid story goes beyond politics.
“Honoring predator Harvey Milk on a U.S. postage stamp is disturbing to say the least,” said American Family Association (AFA, www.afa.net) President Tim Wildmon. “Milk used his charm and power to prey on young boys with emotional problems and drug addiction. He is the last person we should be featuring on a stamp. Furthermore, the radical homosexual lobby will undoubtedly encourage businesses to use these stamps—all in the name of inclusiveness, political correctness and unity. Whatever you think about diversity, no one thinks diversity ought to include pedophilia. This is not diversity; this is perversity.”
According to Milk’s biography, “The Mayor of Castro Street,” written by his own friend and fellow homosexual activist Randy Shilts, “Harvey always had a penchant for young waifs with substance abuse problems,” adding that Milk had a relationship with a 16-year-old boy who was “looking for some kind of father figure. … At 33, Milk was launching a new life, though he could hardly have imagined the unlikely direction toward which his new lover would pull him.”
Milk is the first openly gay politician to be featured on a U.S. postage stamp. He served as a City Councilman in San Francisco in the ‘70s and was gunned down by fellow lawmaker Dan White in 1978.
The stamp will be unveiled at a White House ceremony on May 22—Harvey Milk Day in California.

If governments refuse to implement high enough carbon taxes to eliminate greenhouse gases, in other words, then Gates and Co. believes it has no choice but to “save the planet” by polluting it with sulfate particles.
Spraying the skies with sulfate particles will destroy the planet faster than ‘global warming’ ever could


Blocking the sun with reflective particles will also deprive humans of natural sunlight exposure, which is a primary source for naturally generating health-promoting vitamin D in the body. So once again, Bill Gates is at the helms of a project that seeks to control the climate in artificial ways using toxic chemicals, an endeavor that is sure to create all sorts of potentially irreversible problems for humanity and the planet.

It seems to me that one of the important things to do before that morning comes, is to let every one of your family and friends know that you care for them by finding simple ways to let them know your heartfelt beliefs and the guiding principles of your life so they can always say, “He was my friend, and I know where he stood.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/doe-run-smelter/	Doe Run Smelter to Shut Down Operations	Truth! 				2015/03/17	"In December, the final primary lead smelter in the United States will close. The lead smelter, located in Herculaneum, Missouri, and owned and operated by the Doe Run Company, has existed in the same location since 1892.
The Herculaneum Smelter is currently the only smelter in the United States which can produce lead bullion from raw lead ore that is mined nearby in Missouri’s extensive lead deposits, giving the smelter its “primary” designation. The lead bullion produced in Herculaneum is then sold to lead product producers, including ammunition manufactures for use in conventional ammunition components such as projectiles, projectile cores, and primers. …
Doe Run made significant efforts to reduce lead emissions from the smelter, but in 2008 the federal Environmental Protection Agency issued new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for lead that were 10 times tighter than the previous standard. Given the new lead air quality standard, Doe Run made the decision to close the Herculaneum smelter.
It would be hard to imagine a better example of the Obama Regime’s use of the EPA to impose backdoor tyranny. We would let you have guns, but you see lead causes air pollution.
If you think ammo prices are high now, wait until they close the smelter.
After the Herculaneum smelter closes its doors in December, entirely domestic manufacture of conventional ammunition, from raw ore to finished cartridge, will be impossible.
The national security implications of severely curtailing our ability to produce our own ammunition are obvious. But to our current rulers, national security means something very different from what it did in the past. The idea is no longer to defend America from foreign threats, but to impose the ultimate threat from within.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/chinese-jets-george-washington/	Chinese Jets Sink Navy Aircraft Carrier	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"US ‘Deeply Concerned’ After Chinese Jets Sink Navy Aircraft Carrier



THE PENTAGON — Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday he was “deeply concerned” after Chinese fighter jets sunk a U.S. Navy carrier in international waters earlier this week.
The USS George Washington (CVN-73), a Nimitz class nuclear powered aircraft carrier, began sending warning signals on Thursday after two Chinese Su-27 fighters began a series of screaming low altitude passes mere feet above the flight deck, sending sailors and airmen diving for cover.
The jets pulled numerous, highly dangerous maneuvers around the ship for approximately 20 minutes, before sending a volley of six Kh-31A anti-ship missiles into the carrier superstructure. Hagel said the death toll from the sinking stands at approximately 5,247 sailors dead, with 143 still unaccounted for.
“This is a real tragedy, that, we hope does not damage our relations with the Chinese,” Hagel said.
Two senior defense officials told Duffel Blog the ship’s Phalanx 20mm anti-missile gun systems, which would have normally prevented the attack, had been shut off. The sources said the captain had ordered the weapons disabled when the Chinese fighters began their initial runs to avoid a possible international incident.
In the aftermath of the attack, the Pentagon has ordered a blackout on all surveillance footage from the area so as not to incite any further hostilities in the region.
In a statement, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said he would have a “serious” conversation with Chinese military leaders about the incident “soon.”
The United Nations condemned the incident and issued a non-binding resolution with — make no mistake — very stern wording. Russia and China declined to sign or discuss the document.
At press time, President Obama told reporters that China may have crossed a red line, and he would seriously consider reducing trade with Beijing if it sunk another aircraft carrier.

Corcoran, California – One of the most famous killers in the American prison system will be walking free. On Tuesday Charles Manson, who is now 79 years old, was granted parole by the California Board of Parole and authorized by California Governor Jerry Brown.
According to California Board of Parole Hearings Commissioner John Peck, prison overcrowding forced the prison board to re-evaluate prisoners that are elderly or those with serious illnesses. In February a panel of federal judges ordered California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) two more years to reduce chronic prison overcrowding that has cost the state billions of dollars

The ruling, issued by three judges overseeing the state’s efforts to ease the overcrowding, gives California until February 2016 to achieve their goals. But, the judges said, the state has to make elderly inmates and those with serious illnesses eligible for parole immediately.
Manson, who was denied parole in April of 2012 and wasn’t scheduled for another parole hearing until 2027, was re-evaluated due to his age and health and the Parole Board recommended his parole.
“He is 79 years old and in poor health,” said Commissioner Peck. “We know it’s not going to be a popular decision but, considering our other options he’s the least threat.”
Protesters have already planned to picket the lawn outside of the prison in Corcoran but what is more surprising is the number of supporters that have come out to express joy over the news.
“It’s a great [expletive] day in America!” said Joe Goldsmith, who camped out in from of the prison Wednesday morning decked out in manson gear with tattoos covering his face. “Manson is my idol”
While parole was granted, the actual release date has not yet been set.

This is an unmistakable insult to the honor of the Marine Corps.
David Codrea has revealed that President Obama has so little regard for the United States Marines risking their lives under his command life that they were forced to dismantle their already empty parade rifles for his second inauguration parade. This is nothing less than a slap in the face of the Corps:
“Didn’t know the Marines had to take the bolts out of their rifles for the Inaugural,” an email forwarded to Gun Rights Examiner from a United States Marine Corps source observed. “Wonder if someone can explain why [they] would be marching in the inaugural parade with no bolts in their rifles!”
The email linked to a YouTube video of the 57th Presidential Inaugural Parade, embedded in this column, featuring Bravo Company Marines from the Marine Barracks Washington. Sure enough, the observation in the email is confirmed by watching the video, with screen shots provided in the photo and slide show accompanying this article.
This prompted an internet search to see if others had also noticed, and the Blur-Brain blog had.
“The bolts have been removed from the rifles rendering them unable to fire a round,” the post stated. “Apparently Obama’s Secret Service doesn’t trust the USMC. Simply searching each guy to make sure he didn’t have a live round hidden on him wasn’t enough, they had to make sure the guns were inoperable.
Obama doesn’t trust the very men who put their lives on the line to serve their country. I guess it shouldn’t be that much of a shock. Untrustworthy people find it very difficult to believe that other men have honor.

I imagine, if you had to do it.
Jesse was a chicken plucker. That’s right.
 
He stood on a line in a chicken factory and spent his days
Pulling the feathers off dead chickens so the rest of us
Wouldn’t have to.
It wasn’t much of a job. But at the time,
Jesse didn’t think he was much of a person.
His father was a brute of a man.
His dad was actually thought to be mentally ill
And treated Jesse rough all of his life.
 
Jesse’s older brother wasn’t much better.
He was always picking on Jesse and beating him up.
Yes, Jesse grew up in a very rough home in
West Virginia. Life was anything but easy.
And he thought life didn’t hold much hope for him.
That’s why he was standing in this chicken line,
Doing a job that darn few people wanted.
 
In addition to all the rough treatment at home, it seems
That Jesse was always sick. Sometimes it was real
physical illness, but way too often it was all in his head.
He was a small child, skinny and meek.
That sure didn’t help the situation any.
 
When he started to school, he was the object of every
Bully on the playground.
He was a hypochondriac of the first order.
For Jesse, tomorrow was not always something he
Looked forward to.
But, he had dreams. He wanted to be a ventriloquist.
He found books on ventriloquism. He practiced with
Sock puppets and saved his hard earned dollars until
He could get a real ventriloquist dummy.
 
When he got old enough, he joined the military.
And even though many of his hypochondriac symptoms
Persisted, the military did recognize his talents and
Put him in the entertainment corp.
That was when his world changed.
He gained confidence.
He found that he had a talent for making people laugh,
And laugh so hard they often had tears in their eyes.
Yes, little Jesse had found himself.
 
You know, folks, the history books are full of people
Who overcame a handicap to go on and make a success
Of themselves, but Jesse is one of the few I know of
Who didn’t overcome it. Instead he used his paranoia
To make a million dollars, and become one of
The best-loved characters of all time in doing it!
 
Yes, that little paranoid hypochondriac, who transferred
His nervousness into a successful career, still holds the
Record for the most Emmy’s given in a single category.
 
The wonderful, gifted, talented, and nervous comedian
Who brought us  Barney Fife
Was Jesse Don Knotts.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/harvard-black-mass/	Black Mass at Harvard to Reenact Satanic Rituals	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Harvard Will Host a Satanic Mass

But it won’t “denigrate any religion or faith.”
 
The Ivy League continually sinks to shockingly low depths, but the latest news is particularly chilling. Today, the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club will host the Satanic Temple group as it reenacts a “Black Mass” on Harvard’s main campus.
Just what is a “black mass”? Said to have been created in the Middle Ages by those who practiced witchcraft, the black mass is a Catholic Mass, except inverted — for example, Communion bread is desecrated and mocked. As for the New York–based Satanic Temple, it is the same group that recently proposed erecting a large statue of the devil beside an existing Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma.
The Harvard student group is standing by its decision to host the event,stating: “Our purpose is not to denigrate any religion or faith, which would be repugnant to our educational purposes, but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural practices.”
Pardon me, but “our purpose is not to denigrate any religion or faith”? The entire purpose of a black mass is to denigrate the Catholic faith. Do they no longer teach basic-level thinking at Harvard?
As Yahoo! reports, the Archdiocese of Boston is calling on its faithful to pray for those involved and on Harvard to disassociate itself from the event. It says that such activity “separates people from God and the human community, it is contrary to charity and goodness, and it places participants dangerously close to destructive works of evil.”
Some media reports have been quick to downplay the controversy, with the New York Daily News almost mocking the Archdiocese’s concerns, writing: “All this talk about Satan has spooked the Catholic Church.”
The Satanic Temple’s spokesperson, who goes by “Lucien Graeves” (of course his name would be Lucien — I had at least three friends named Lucien in my goth days), spoke to the Daily News, stating that the black mass is meant to be educational and is not a supernatural ritual (adding he is an “atheist”).
The Daily News continues with a “nothing to see here, folks” tone, writing: “This makes The Satanic Temple’s activities more of a political statement than a cohesive religious ritual.”
But is this event really just political and not at all “religious”? The Satanic Temple describes itself as an “organized religion.” Will not this black mass incorporate language, symbolism, and artifacts of undeniable religious significance?
And if the Harvard group’s purpose is purely one of exploring political “disruption” or social radicalism from an educational standpoint, it raises the question: Would an event mocking Islamic beliefs ever be similarly hosted? We all know the answer.
Given the seminary origins of Harvard, and its early motto of Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae (“Truth for Christ and the Church”), how far has this nation sunk when this event is held on Harvard’s own grounds?

 Subject: 10-010-05 Interesting – Govt. checks Your Computer
Subject: Pass on please Guys
GOVERNMENT AND COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS CAUGHT INSTALLING HARD-WIRED KEYSTROKE LOGGERS INTO ALL NEW LAPTOP COMPUTERS!
Turner Radio Network | October 4, 2005
 
Devices capture everything you ever type, then can send it via your ethernet card to the Dept. of Homeland Security without your knowledge, consent or a search warrant each time you log onto the internet!
Freedom Of Information Act Requests For Explanation From DHS, refused.
I was opening up my almost brand new laptop, to replace a broken PCMCIA slot riser on the motherboard. As soon as I got the keyboard off, I noticed a small cable running from the keyboard connection underneath a piece of metal protecting the motherboard.

 

I figured “No Big Deal”, and continued with the dissasembly. But when I got the metal panels off, I saw a small white heatshink-wrapped package. Being ever-curious, I sliced the heatshrink open. I found a little circuit board inside.



Being an EE by trade, this piqued my curiosity considerably. On one side of the board, one Atmel AT45D041A four megabit Flash memory chip.



On the other side, one Microchip Technology PIC16F876 Programmable Interrupt Controller, along with a little Fairchild Semiconductor CD4066BCM quad bilateral switch.
Looking further, I saw that the other end of the cable was connected to the integrated ethernet board.
What could this mean? I called the manufacturer’s tech support about it, and they said, and I quote, “The intregrated service tag identifier is there for assisting customers in the event of lost or misplaced personal information.” He then hung up.
A little more research, and I found that that board spliced in between the keyboard and the ethernet chip is little more than a Keyghost hardware keylogger.
 

The reasons a computer manufacturer would put this in their laptops can only be left up to your imagination. It would be very impractical to hand-anylze the logs, and very CPU-intensive to do so on a computer for every person that purchased a laptop. Why are these keyloggers here? I recently almost found out.
I called the police, as having a keylogger unknown to me in my laptop is a serious offense. They told me to call the Department of Homeland Security. At this point, I am in disbelief. Why would the DHS have a keylogger in my laptop? It was surreal.
So I called them, and they told me to submit a Freedom of Information Act request. This is what I got back:
.
Under the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) the only items exempt from public disclosure are items relating to “law enforcement tools and techniques” and “items relating to national security.”
The real life implications of this are plain: Computer manufacturers appear to be cooperating with the Department of Homeland Security to make every person who buys a new computer subject to immediate, unrestricted government recording of everything they do on those computers! EVERYTHING!
This information can be sent to DHS, online, without your knowledge or consent, without a search warrant or even probable cause! That’s why this device is hard-wired directly into the ethernet card, which communicates over the internet!
I am not certain how long this information will be permitted to remain online for all the world to see before the government takes some type of action to attempt to have it removed from public view. I URGE you to take copy of this page immediately and spread this information to everyone you know immediately! The more people who find out about this, the more can protect themselves and raise a HUGE outcry to force government and computer manufacturers to immediately CEASE installing these devices in new computers!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/nhs-hospitals-incinerated-aborted-babies/	Aborted Babies Incinerated To Heat U.K. Hospitals	Truth!				2015/03/17	"UK: 15,000 Aborted Babies Incinerated To Heat Hospitals, Discarded As “Clinical Waste” 
 
 
 
The UK has thrown itself off a progressive cliff that leads to ruin. From adopting Sharia law as standard legal practice, to using aborted babies to heat hospitals, the UK is teetering on the brink of certain destruction. Fifteen thousand aborted babies were incinerated to heat hospital; it’s is appalling. Is the UK becoming Hitler’s Nazi Germany? Without a doubt. This is a body crematorium, with aborted babies incinerated like wood in stove; which is exactly what they were being used to do, heat hospital buildings. One could call this an abortion Auschwitz. Dead bodies of the unborn discarded as waste, like used syringes. Evil knows no bounds. The Telegraph reports:
The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals, an investigation has found.
NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other rubbish while two others used the bodies in ‘waste-to-energy’ plants which generate power for heat.
Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded ‘totally unacceptable.’
Aborted babies incinerated for the purposes of heating hospitals has no plausible explanation. There is nothing to justify such a horrific practice. To say it is “totally unacceptable” is the understatement of the year. These are babies, human beings. Nothing can explain such barbaric practices, except to say that those partaking in it are missing a moral compass.
At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over the last two years alone, Channel 4’s Dispatches discovered.
The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains.
The thought of this going on for two years is unfathomable. Over 15,000 aborted babies incinerated is just a portion of the babies that are aborted each year, and this is just from several UK hospital figures. In the United States alone, at least800,000 abortions are performed each year. But, the most horrifying aspect is this incinerating was government sanctioned. The UK government program NHS views murdered fetuses as heating fuel.
One of the country’s leading hospitals, Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge, incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own ‘waste to energy’ plant. The mothers were told the remains had been ‘cremated.’
Another ‘waste to energy’ facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and 2013.
They were brought in from another hospital before being burned, generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich Hospital itself disposes of remains by cremation.
Dead babies, brought in as to a plant as “waste to energy,” and then mother’s being lied to about the process also defies all logic. Considering these were also miscarried babies, not deliberately murdered, the pain in knowing that the fetus was used to heat hospitals would be too much to bear. Abortion is a Holocaust of its own, and burning fetuses ties it to Hitler’s atrocities. Hitler viciously murdered 1.5 million Jewish children in a deliberate genocide that failed. But what the world lost to his Holocaust can never be returned or replaced. Abortion has claimed the lives of almost 57 million babies, according to Lifenews estimates since 1973. Roe vs. Wade is undoubtedly the worst atrocity to gain legal acceptance. Aborted babies incinerated into heating fuel proves how little life is valued, especially those precious lives that are never given the chance to live.
While the pro-abortion movement frequently condemns pro-life advocates who draw comparisons between abortion and the Holocaust, the report of babies burned to heat UK hospitals is a shocking reminder of the callous way human life was treated by the Nazi regime.
Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.
A spokeswoman said: “The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate foetal remains.”
The truth has come out, and it is appalling. Babies discarded as “clinical waste,” and burned as a heating source is the height of barbarity. When the blood turns cold and life is no longer recognized as valuable or regarded with respect, people turn into animals, and entire governments into executioners. Such is the case in the UK, where insanity has taken hold and become the new reality. Aborted babies are now incinerated for heat, and for what cost? There is no price one can place on a life, but when God is removed from the equation, life is worth nothing.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/va-christmas/	V.A. Hospital Refuses to Allow ‘Merry Christmas’ Cards	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"VA hospital refuses to accept ‘Merry Christmas’ cards
By Todd StarnesPublished December 25, 2013 FoxNews.com
Boys and girls at Grace Academy in Prosper, Tex., spent most of last Friday making homemade Christmas cards for bedridden veterans at the VA hospital in Dallas.
Fourth-grader Gracie Brown was especially proud of her card, hoping it would “make their day because their family might live far away, and they might not have somebody to celebrate Christmas with.”
“I’d like them to know they’ve not been forgotten and somebody wanted to say thank you,” Gracie told MyFoxDFW.com.
Gracie’s card read, “Merry Christmas. Thank you for your service.” It also included an American flag.
But the bedridden veterans at the VA hospital will never get to see Gracie’s card. Nor will they see the cards made by 51 other students. That’s because the Christmas cards violated VA policy.
“It really didn’t occur to me there would be a problem with distributing Christmas cards,” said Susan Chapman, a math teacher at the academy. She’s married to a veteran and volunteers with the American Legion and other veterans’ organizations.
On Monday morning the boys and girls were planning on hand delivering the cards to the wounded veterans. Chapman called the hospital to make final arrangements and that’s when she learned there was a problem.
“I told him my students made cards, we’d like to bring them down for the veterans,” Chapman told the television station. “And he said, ‘That’s great. We’re thrilled to have them, except the only thing is, we can’t accept anything that says ‘Merry Christmas’ or ‘God bless you’ or any scriptural references because of all the red tape.'”
A VA official quoted the policy which is in the Veterans Health Administration handbook:
“In order to be respectful of our veterans’ religious beliefs, all donated holiday cards are reviewed by a multi-disciplinary team of staff led by chaplaincy services and determined if they are appropriate (non-religious) to freely distribute to patients. We regret this process was not fully explained to this group and apologize for any misunderstanding.”
Hiram Sasser, director of litigation for Liberty Institute, said it was a new low “even for the Scrooges and Grinches at the VA.”
“Targeting the benevolent work of little children for censorship is disgusting,” Sasser told me. “Do the Grinches in the administration of the VA really believe our bravest warriors need protection from the heartfelt well wishes of small children saying Merry Christmas?”
Andrea Brown, Gracie’s mom, was dumbfounded by the news.
“This wasn’t the country I grew up in, when you couldn’t say ‘Merry Christmas,’ you couldn’t say ‘God bless you’ or reference any scripture,” she told MyFoxDFW.com.
She told the television station the boys and girls were heartbroken that the military personnel would not be able to receive their cards.
“They couldn’t believe the people that these people they wanted to honor weren’t going to get the chance to see what they had done,” she said.
The cards will not be thrown away — they are being shipped to Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio and to a private facility for veterans in Louisiana.
Sasser said at some point, “does the VA have no shame?”
“Mr. Potter from ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ wouldn’t even ban little children from wishing our veterans Merry Christmas,” Sasser said.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/smithfield-farms-china/	Chinese Firm Purchased Smithfield Farms	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Smithfield Farms, the largest pork producing farm in the USA was sold in September to China with the unanimous support of its stockholders!!


The hogs will still be raised here, but slaughtered and packaged for sale there before being sent back here. This includes labels of Morrell, Eckrich, Krakus, Cudahy, Premium Hams, Cook’s, Gwaltney, The same with many chickens. They can now be shipped there, but when they come back all that needs to be labeled is that they WERE RAISED IN THE USA. Not that they were processed in China!!! Our great FDA at work again. The chickens will be all processed and most sold to fast food restaurants for sandwiches, along with schools and supermarkets. The China slaughter and processing are not nearly equal to the requirements here.
*BAD FOOD.*.*
We recently learned that Starkist Tuna is now owned by Korea , and is in big conflict with the U. S. concerning quality, safety, and records, which Korea refuses to produce.
Read several articles on Google about this, and even one that was defending the eating of tilapia said to avoid the fish that came from China .? Also,
I had just returned home from buying Albertson’s 4-day special of 4 bags of frozen tilapia for the price of one.? Sure enough, on the top of the bags, it read “farm raised”, and on the bottom in small print it said, ” China ” read all the way down…
Recently a Food inspector on TV… said he had lived overseas and he had seen the filthy conditions their foods are raised and processed in. It is enough to make you throw up. Some foreign workers have to wear masks as they work in these places, because the food is so rotten and filthy, it makes them want to throw up. Many of their fish on Fish Farms are fed raw sewage daily. He said he has seen so much filth throughout their food growing and processing that he would “never” eat any of it. They raise this filth, put some food coloring and some flavorings on it, then they ship it to the USA & Canada for YOU to consume and feed to YOUR families. They have no Food & Safety Inspectors. They ship it to you to buy and poison your families and friends .
Imported food we eat and the junk we buy:
Green Giant frozen vegetables are from China, and so are most of Europe ‘s Best.
Arctic Gardens are Okay. So is Birdseye.
*Never buy the grocery store garlic unless it is clearly marked from USA or Canada *, the other stuff is grown in people poop (even worse than chicken poop). China is the largest producer of garlic in the world; U. S. is next.
*Buy only local honey *, much honey is shipped in huge containers from China and re-packed here.
Cold-FX is grown and packed in China and is full of fecal bacteria. Doesn’t work anyway, big scam.
If the country of origin is not clearly marked beware.
If produce, ask an employee.
 
Watch out for packages which state “prepared for”, “packed by” or “imported by”. We don’t understand the lack of mandatory labeling, especially the produce.
The country of origin should be clearly shown on the item in the store.
Go to the local farmers’ markets in season and keep a wary eye open the rest of the year.
Please read this very carefully, and read to the very bottom. It’s important for all of us.
 
How is it possible to ship food from China cheaper than having it produced in the U. S. or Canada?
FOR EXAMPLE THE “OUR FAMILY” BRAND OF MANDARIN ORANGES SAYS RIGHT ON THE CAN ‘FROM CHINA ‘. SO, FOR A FEW MORE CENTS, BUY THE LIBERTY BRAND.
*GOLD BRAND OR THE DOLE IS FROM CALIFORNIA *.
Beware, Costco sells canned peaches and pears in a plastic jar that come from China.
ALL “HIGH LINER” AND MOST OTHER FROZEN FISH PRODUCTS COME FROM CHINA OR INDONESIA . THE PACKAGE MAY SAY “PACIFIC SALMON” ON THE FRONT, BUT LOOK FOR THE SMALL PRINT. MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS COME FROM FISH FARMS IN THE ORIENT WHERE THERE ARE NO REGULATIONS ON WHAT IS FED TO THESE FISH.
*Recently The Montreal Gazette had an article *by the Canadian Government on how Chinese feed the fish: They suspend chicken wire crates over the fish ponds, and the fish feed on chicken s–t.
If you search the internet about what the Chinese feed their fish, you’ll
be alarmed; e. g, growth hormones, expired anti-biotic from humans.? Never buy any type of fish or shellfish that comes from these countries: Vietnam, China , Philippines.
Check this out personally.
Steinfeld’s Pickles are made in India – just as bad!
Another example is in canned mushrooms. No-Name brand came from Indonesia ..
Also check those little fruit cups. They used to be made in Canada in the Niagara region until about 2 years ago. They are now packaged in China. Most sold in Aldi stores.
While the Chinese export inferior and even toxic products, dangerous toys, and goods to be sold in North American markets, the media wrings its hands! Yet, 70% of North Americans believe that the trading privileges afforded to the Chinese should be suspended.
Well, duh! Why do you need the government to suspend trading privileges?
SIMPLY DO IT YOURSELF, CANADA AND THE U. S.
Simply look on the bottom of every product you buy, and if it says ‘Made in China ‘ or ‘PRC’ (and that now includes Hong Kong ), simply choose another product, or none at all. You will be amazed at how dependent you are on Chinese products, and you will be equally amazed at what you can do without.
THINK ABOUT THIS:
If 200 million North Americans refuse to buy just $20 each of Chinese goods, that’s a billion dollar trade imbalance resolved in our favor…
fast! The downside? Some Canadian/American businesses will feel a temporary pinch from having foreign stockpiles of inventory.
Just one month of trading losses will hit the Chinese for 8% of their North American exports. Then they will at least have to ask themselves if the benefits of their arrogance and lawlessness are worth it.
*START NOW and don’t stop and tell your friends *.
Send this to everybody you know. Let’s show them that we are intelligent, and NOBODY can take us for granted. *Start reading labels more closely and buy something else even if it cost a few cents more.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/satanic-barista-at-starbucks/	Satanic Barista at Starbucks Upsets Catholic Customer	Truth!				2015/03/17	" Satanic Barista at Starbucks 
 
 
Would you care for some extra sin with your morning coffee? That’s what one Christian woman in Louisiana got after a Starbucks employee drizzled Satanic symbols, in caramel, on her latte.
Catholic school teacher Megan Pinion received the rather disturbing artistic creation at her local Starbucks in Baton Rouge, then went on Facebook to reprimand the young barista.
“I unfortunately can’t give the young man’s name who served it, because I was so appalled that I could not bring myself to look at him,” Pinion wrote in her post, according to the Louisiana Advertiser.
She went on, “I am in no way judging his beliefs or dis-meriting his beautiful artwork, I am however judging his lack of professionalism and respect for others. I am a teacher in the public school system and if I were to present a child of atheist or pagan believers with a Christian art project I could be sued in a heartbeat. I am of Catholic faith and would love to share in my beliefs daily. Fortunately I have enough common sense to present myself with professionalism and follow an ethics code. Perhaps that could be suggested to that particular location.”
Starbucks social media spokesman Tom Kuhn says the company took notice of the complaint and promptly offered Pinion an apology.
“[Sunday] was the first we heard of it when she posted on our Facebook page,” told the Advertiser. “We reached out to her through social media and apologized. We’re taking the complaint seriously. We’re not sure who served her or what kind of beverage it was. It looks kind of caramel-ish in the photos.”
Kuhn did not comment on whether the devil-worshipping barista was still employed at Starbucks (and still slinging satanic chai lattes to unsuspecting customers), so be sure to check your coffee before you drink it. Frappuchinos are expensive enough without having to sell your soul for them too.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/foxbat/	Advanced Russian Fighter Found in the Sand in Iraq	Truth! & Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Wednesday August 6, 2003
NewsMax.com has obtained exclusive photos of a buried Iraqi jet fighter being recovered by U.S. Air Force troops. The Iraqi jet, an advanced Russian MiG-25 Foxbat, was found buried in the sand after an informant tipped off U.S. troops.
The MiG was dug out of a massive sand dune near the Al Taqqadum airfield by U.S. Air Force recovery teams. The MiG was reportedly one of over two dozen Iraqi jets buried in the sand, like hidden treasure, waiting to be recovered at a later date.
Contrary to what some in the major media have reported, not all the jets found were from the Gulf War era.
The Russian-made MiG-25 Foxbat being recovered by U.S. Air Force troops in the photos is an advanced reconnaissance version never before seen in the West and is equipped with sophisticated electronic warfare devices.
U.S. Air Force recovery teams had to use large earth-moving equipment to uncover the MiG, which is over 70 feet long and weighs nearly 25 tons.
The Foxbat is known to be one of Iraq’s top jet fighters. The advanced electronic reconnaissance version found by the U.S. Air Force is currently in service with the Russian air force. The MiG is capable of flying at speeds of over 2,000 miles an hour, or three times the speed of sound, and at altitudes of over 75,000 feet.
The recovery of the advanced MiG fighter is considered to be an intelligence coup by the U.S. Air Force. The Foxbat may also be equipped with advanced Russian- and French-made electronics that were sold to Iraq during the 1990s in violation of a
U.N. ban on arms sales to Baghdad.
The buried aircraft at Al Taqqadum were covered in camouflage netting, sealed and, in many cases, had their wings removed before being buried more than 10 feet beneath the Iraqi desert.
X Marks the Spot
The discovery of the buried Iraqi jet fighters illustrates the problem faced by U.S. inspection teams searching Iraq for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq is larger in size than California, and the massive deserts south and west of Baghdad were used by Saddam Hussein to hide weapons during the first Gulf war.
U.S. intelligence sources have already uncovered several mass grave burial sites in the open deserts with an estimated 10,000 dead hidden there. In addition, Iraq previously hid SCUD missiles, chemical weapons and biological warheads by burying them under the desert sand.
U.N. inspection teams found the weapons in the early 1990s after detailed information of the exact locations was obtained.
Top U.S. weapons inspector Dr. David Kay is known to favor human intelligence as the primary means to find Iraq’s hidden treasure trove of weapons and secrets.
While there are rumors of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons being shipped to nearby Syria, the weapons may very well still remain inside Iraq buried under the vast desert wastelands.
Some critics of the Bush administration have claimed that the inability of U.S. forces to uncover weapons of mass destruction is proof that the president misled the nation into the war with Iraq.
However, in recent days the critics have fallen silent as word quietly leaked from Iraq that major discoveries have already been made and are now being documented completely. Bush administration officials are keeping any such discoveries secret for the moment.

A resident in the area saw a ball in a pond, bouncing around kind of  strange. And when he went to investigate, he discovered that it was a  catfish and it had obviously tried to swallow a child’s basketball which became stuck in its mouth.
The fish was totally exhausted from trying to dive. The resident tried  numerous times to get the ball out but was unsuccessful. He finally cut the  ball in order to deflate it, and then released the catfish.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/partialeject/	The Navy Crewman Who Survived a Partial Ejection From his Navy Jet	Truth!				2015/03/17	"Lieutenant Keith Gallagher’s Account:
Murphy’s Law says, “Whatever can go wrong, will, and when you least expect it.” (And, of course, we all know that Murphy was an aviator.) Murphy was correct beyond his wildest dreams in my case. Fortunately for me, however, he failed to follow through. On my 26th birthday I was blindsided by a piece of bad luck the size of Texas that should have killed me. Luckily, it was followed immediately by a whole slew of miracles that allowed me to be around for my 27th. Not even Murphy could have conceived of such a bizarre accident (many people still find it hard to believe), and the fact that I am here to write about it makes it that much more bizarre. We were the overhead tanker, one third of the way through cruise, making circles in the sky. Although the tanker pattern can be pretty boring midway through the cycle, we were alert and maintaining a good lookout doctrine because out air wing had a midair less than a week before, and we did not want to repeat. We felt we were ready for “any” emergency: fire lights, hydraulic failures and fuel transfer problems. Bring ’em on! We were ready for them. After all, how much trouble can two JO’s get in overhead the ship? After my third fuel update call, we decided that the left outboard drop was going to require a little help in order to transfer. NATOPS recommends applying positive and negative G to force the valve open. As the pilot pulled the stick back I wondered how many times we would have to porpoise the nose of the plane before the valve opened. As he moved the stick forward, I felt the familiar sensation of negative “G”, and then something strange happened: my head touched the canopy. For a brief moment I thought that I had failed to tighten my lap belts, but I knew that wasn’t true. Before I could complete that thought, there was a loud bang, followed by wind, noise, disorientation and more wind, wind, wind. Confusion reigned in my mind as I was forced back against my seat, head against the headrest, arms out behind me, the wind roaring in my head, pounding against my body. “Did the canopy blow off? Did I eject? Did my windscreen implode?” All of these questions occurred to me amidst the pandemonium in my mind and over my body. These questions were quickly answered, and replaced by a thousand more, as I looked down and saw a sight that I will never forget: the top of the canopy, close enough to touch, and through the canopy I could see the top of my pilot’s helmet. It took a few moments for this image to sink into my suddenly overloaded brain. This was worse than I ever could have imagined – I was sitting on top of a flying A-6! Pain, confusion, panic, fear and denial surged through my brain and body as a new development occurred to me: I couldn’t breathe. My helmet and mask had ripped off my head, and without them, the full force of the wind was hitting me square in the face. It was like trying to drink through a fire hose. I couldn’t seem to get a breath of air amidst the wind. My arms were dragging along behind me until I managed to pull both of them into my chest and hold them there. I tried to think for a second as I continued my attempts to breathe. For some reason, it never occurred to me that my pilot would be trying to land. I just never thought about it. I finally decided that the only thing that I could do was eject. (What else could I do?) I grabbed the lower handle with both hands and pulled-it wouldn’t budge. With a little more panic induced strength I tried again, but to no avail. The handle was not going to move. I attempted to reach the upper handle but the wind prevented me from getting a hand on it. As a matter of fact, all that I could do was hold my arms into my chest. If either of them slid out into the wind stream, they immediately flailed out behind me, and that was definitely not good. The wind had become physically and emotionally overwhelming. It pounded against my face and body like a huge wall of water that wouldn’t stop. The roaring in my ears confused me, the pressure in my mouth prevented me from breathing, and the pounding on my eyes kept me from seeing. Time had lost all meaning. For all I knew, I could have been sitting there for seconds or for hours. I was suffocating, and I couldn’t seem to get a breath. I wish I could say that my last thoughts were of my wife, but as I felt myself blacking out, all I said was, “I don’t want to die.” Close up of Keith just after landing. Someone turned on the lights and I had a funny view of the front end of an A-6, with jagged Plexiglas where my half of the canopy was supposed to be. Looking down from the top of the jet, I was surprised to find the plane stopped on the flight deck with about 100 people looking up at me. (I guess I was surprised because I had expected to see the pearly gates and some dead relatives.) My first thought was that we had never taken off, that something had happened before the catapult. Then everything came flooding back into my brain, the wind, the noise and the confusion. As my pilot spoke to me and the medical people swarmed all over me, I realized that I had survived, I was alive. It didn’t take me very long to realize that I was a very lucky man, but as I heard more details, I found out how lucky I was. For example, my parachute became entangled in the horizontal stabilizer tight enough to act as a shoulder harness for the trap, but not tight, enough to bind the flight controls. If this had not happened, I would have been thrown into the jagged Plexiglas during the trap as my shoulder harness had been disconnected from the seat as the parachute deployed. There are many other things that happened, or didn’t happen, that allowed me to survive this mishap, some of them only inches away from disaster. These little things, and a s-hot, level headed pilot who reacted quickly and correctly are the reason that I am alive and flying today. Also, a generous helping of good old-fashioned Irish luck didn’t hurt.
Lieutenant Mark Baden’s (pilot) Account of the Incident:
As we finished the brief, my BN (bombardier navigator – Keith Gallagher)told me that it was his birthday and that our recovery would be his100thtrap on the boat. To top it off, we were assigned the plane with my name on the side. As we taxied out of the chocks, I was still feeling a little uneasy about all the recent mishaps. To make myself feel better, I went through the “soft shot/engine failure on takeoff” EPs (emergency procedures), touching each switch or lever as I went through the steps. “At least if something happens right off the bat, I’ll be ready,” I thought. The first few minutes of the hop were busy. Concentrating on the package-check and consolidation, as well as trying to keep track of my initial customers, dispelled my uneasiness. As we approached mid-cycle, that most boring time in a tanker hop, we kept ourselves occupied with fuel checks. We were keeping a close eye on one drop tank that had quit transferring with about 1,000 pounds of fuel still inside. I had tried going to override on the tank pressurization, but that didn’t seem to work. My BN and I discussed the problem. We decided it was probably a stuck float valve. Perhaps some positive and negative G would fix it. We were at 8,000feet, seven miles abeam the ship, heading aft. I clicked the altitude hold off and added some power to give us a little more G. At 230 knots I pulled the stick back and got the plane five degrees nose up. Then I pushed the stick forward. I got about half a negative G, just enough to float me in the seat. I heard a sharp bang and felt the cockpit instantly depressurize. The roar of the wind followed. I ducked instinctively and looked up at the canopy expecting it to be partly open. Something was wrong. Instead of seeing a two or three inch gap, the canopy bow was flush with the front of the windscreen. My eyes tracked down to the canopy switch. It was up. Moment of impact my scan continued right. Instead of meeting my BN’s questioning glance, I saw a pair of legs at my eye level. The right side of the canopy was shattered. I followed the legs up and saw the rest of my BN’s body out in the wind blast. I watched as his head snapped down and then back up, and his helmet and oxygen mask disappeared. They didn’t fly off; they just disappeared. My mind went into fast forward. “What the hell happened?” I wondered. “I hope he ejects all the way. What am I going to do now? I need to slow down.” I jerked the throttles to idle and started the speed brakes out. Without stopping, I reached up, de-isolated, and threw the flap lever to the down position. I reached over and grabbed for the IFF selector switch and twisted it to EMER. I was screaming “Slow down! Slow down!” to myself as I looked up at the airspeed indicator and gave another pull back on the throttles and speed brakes. The airspeed was passing 200 knots. I had been looking back over my shoulder at my bombardier the whole time I was doing everything else. I felt a strange combination of fear, helplessness and revulsion as I watched his body slam around in the wind blast. After his helmet flew off, his face looked like the people who get sucked out into zero atmosphere in some of the more graphic movies. His eyes were being blasted open, his cheeks and lips were puffed out to impossible size and the tendons in his neck looked like they were about to bust through his skin as he fought for his life. At 200 knots I saw his arms pulled up in front of his face and he was clawing behind his head. For a moment, I thought he was going to manage to pull the handle and get clear of the plane. I was mentally cheering for him. His arms got yanked down by the blast and I cursed as I checked my radio selector switch to radio 1.”Mayday, Mayday, this is 515. My BN has partially ejected. I need an emergency pull-forward!” The reply was an immediate, “Roger, switch button six.” I switched freqs and said (or maybe yelled), “Boss (Air Officer), this is 515. My BN has partially ejected. I need an emergency full-forward!” I slapped the gear handle down and turned all my dumps on (in an effort to get slower, max trap never crossed my mind).The Boss came back in his ever-calm voice and said, “Bring it on in.” Checking out the BN as I watched, the indexers move from on-speed to a green chevron I worked the nose to keep the plane as slow as possible and still flying. The plane was holding at around 160 knots and descending. My BN’s legs were kicking, which gave me some comfort; he was not dead. But, watching his head and body jerked around in the wind blast, being literally beaten to death, made me ill. I had been arcing around in my descent and was still at seven miles. The boss came up and asked if the BN was still with the aircraft. I think that I caused a few cases of nausea when I answered, “Only his legs are still inside the cockpit.” It made sense to me, but more than a few people who were listening had visions of two legs and lots of blood and no body. Fortunately, the Boss understood what I meant. As I turned in astern the boat, I called the Boss and told him I was six miles behind the boat. I asked how the deck was coming. He asked if I was setting myself up for a straight-in. I told him “yes.” He told me to continue. It was then I noticed that my BN had quit kicking. A chill shot through my body and I looked back at him. What I saw scared me even more. His head was turned to the left and laying on his left shoulder. He was starting to turn grey. Maybe he had broken his neck and was dead. Bringing back a body that was a friend only minutes before was not a comfortable thought. I forced myself not to look at my bombardier after that. The front windscreen started to fog up about four miles behind the boat. I cranked the defog all the way and was getting ready to unstrap my shoulder harness so I could wipe off the glass when it finally started clearing. I saw the boat making a hard left turn. I made some disparaging remarks about the guys on the bridge as I rolled right to chase centerline. I heard CAG paddles (landing signal officer) come up on the radio. He told the captain he would take the winds and that he needed to steady up. My tension eased slightly as I saw mother begin to leave her wake in a straight line. Coming in for landing I was driving it in at about 300 feet. I had been in a slight descent and wasn’t willing to add enough power to climb back up to a normal straight-in altitude for fear I would have to accelerate and do more damage to my already battered BN. I watched the ball move up to red and then move slowly up towards the center. Paddles called for some rudder and told me not to go high. My scan went immediately to the 1-wire.I had no intention of passing up any “perfectly good wires.” I touched down short of the 1-wire and sucked the throttles to idle. The canopy shards directly in front of the BN’s chest looked like a butcher’s knife collection. I was very concerned that the deceleration of the trap was going to throw him into the jagged edge of the canopy. I cringed when I didn’t immediately feel the tug of the wire. I pulled the stick into my lap as paddles was calling for altitude. I got the nose gear off the deck and then felt the hook catch a wire. I breathed a sigh of relief. Testing the spool-up time of a pair of J-52s as I rolled off the end of the angle was not the way I wanted to end an already bad hop. As soon as I stopped, I set the parking brake and a yellow shirt gave me the signal to kill my No. 2 engine. Immediately after that, I heard a call over the radio that I was chocked. I killed no. 1 and began unstrapping. As soon as I was free of my seat (I somehow remembered to safe it), I reached over and safed the BN’s lower handle, undid his lower koch fittings and reached up to try to safe his upper handle. As I was crawling up, I saw that his upper handle was already safed. I started to release his upper koch fittings but decided they were holding him in and I didn’t want him to fall against the razor-sharp Plexiglas on his side. I got back on my side of the cockpit, held his left arm and hand, and waited for the medical people to arrive. I realized he still was alive whe
n he said, “Am I on the flight deck?” A wave of indescribable relief washed over me as I talked to him while the crash crew worked to truss him up and pull him out of the seat. Once he was clear of the plane, they towed me out of the landing area and parked me. A plane captain bumped the canopy open by hand far enough that I could squeeze out. I headed straight for medical without looking back at the plane. Later, I found that ignorance can be bliss. I didn’t know two things while I was flying. First, the BN’s parachute had deployed and wrapped itself around the tail section of the plane. Second, the timing release mechanism had fired and released the BN from the seat. The only things keeping him in the plane were the parachute risers holding him against the back of the seat.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/scientists-clone-dinosaur/	BRITISH SCIENTISTS CLONE DINOSAUR	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" BRITISH SCIENTISTS CLONE DINOSAUR

 

Scientists at Liverpool’s John Moore University have successfully cloned a dinosaur, a spokesman from the university said yesterday. The dinosaur, a baby Apatosaurus nicknamed “Spot,” is currently being incubated at the University’s College of Veterinary Medicine.
The scientists extracted DNA from preserved Apatosaurus fossils, which were on display at the university’s museum of natural science. Once the DNA was harvested, scientists injected it into a fertile ostrich womb.
“Ostriches share a lot of genetic traits with dinosaurs,” said Dr. Gerrard Jones, a biology professor at LJMU and the project’s leading scientist. “Their eggshell microstructures are almost identical to those of the Apatosaurus.
That’s why the cloning worked so perfectly.” Those in the scientific community say the dinosaur cloning – the first ever of its kind – is a milestone for genetic engineering. “I used to think this kind of thing could only happen in the movies,” said Dr. Gemma Sheridan, a LJMU chemistry professor. “But we’re making it happen right here in our lab. It’s astounding.”
The cloning attracted the attention of a wide variety of animal rights activists and religious groups. They claim that animal cloning is unethical and immoral. PETA President Craig Farmer criticized the scientists for performing potentially life threatening threats on a new species. “These scientists brought an animal from the Jurassic age back to life – just to watch it suffer!” he said.
But Dr. Sheridan doesn’t seem to be bothered by the activists’ quibbling. She says that the opportunities afforded by dinosaur cloning are endless. Within ten years, we could repopulate the world with dinosaurs,” she said. As of press time, the dinosaur is in stable condition. Scientists plan to run more tests on him today.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/coca-cola-ad-super-bowl-2014/	Letter to Coke over America the Beautiful	Unproven!				2015/03/17	"I watched some of the commercials that were played during the Super Bowl. I always enjoy the ones from Anheuser Busch. They showed the “Welcome Home” celebration in Winter Park , Florida , for returning soldiers. And who doesn’t love those Clydesdales? I didn’t like the one from Coca Cola. All those young women singing “America The Beautiful” dressed in ethnic garb and singing in a foreign language really pissed me off. Americans sing in English to honor America ; not Farsi or Urdu. 
I left a comment for Coke on YouTube under the video of that commercial. I got a reply from them today, which you can read below, and then you can read my answer to them. Maybe this time they’ll understand. 
I received this from Coke:  Thank you for your email and your loyalty to Coca-Cola over the years, . We greatly value your business and appreciate hearing from you. 

“It’s Beautiful” was created to celebrate Coke moments among all Americans who together enjoy ice cold, refreshing Coke. For centuries America has opened its arms to people of many countries who have helped to build this great nation. “It’s Beautiful” provides a snapshot of the real lives of Americans representing diverse ethnicities, religions, races and families, all found in the United States . All those featured in the ad are Americans and “ America The Beautiful” was sung by bilingual American young women. 

We believe “It’s Beautiful” is a great example of the magic that makes our country so special, and a powerful message that spreads optimism, promotes inclusion and celebrates humanity – values that are core to Coca-Cola. 

You can find out more about our ad by going to Journey. I really appreciate your feedback and hope this will keep you as a valued customer of ours. We appreciate your interest in our Company.  Timothy  Industry and Consumer Affairs  The Coca-Cola Company  Please use the record number below should you have additional questions. 
 My Reply: 
Where do you live, Timothy? Since you’re with Coca Cola, it is likely Buckhead or one of Atlanta ’s other exclusive, executive, country club neighborhoods. I lived in one for over two decades, in Hudson , Ohio … I know what they’re like. My youngest son lives in one near Atlanta , too, as he is a successful broker with E-Trade, in Alpharetta. Those neighborhoods are not what most of this country is like, however. Maybe you haven’t traveled much, or lived in many different states as I have. 
America’s not so beautiful anymore, and it is full of immigrants that have no intention of assimilating into our society or becoming truly American. They brought their own culture, keep their own culture, and never learn anything about ours, except to use it to their advantage. They don’t even like Americans. They make no effort to learn our language. Ever been to Detroit ? I’ll bet you never tried to enter the closed Muslim festival that takes place near Ann Arbor , because you’d probably be assaulted before you got a block away. We Americans are not so proud of that kind of behavior, and they aren’t there to celebrate being American. 
How about Collinsville , Ohio ? That’s a part of Cleveland , and the Collinsville police once yelled at me to “get the hell out of this black neighborhood, lady, or we will be calling the meat wagon!” because I had gotten lost there. Police there were barricaded behind locked doors, and one could not see a police officer, but were required, in the lobby of the station, to pick up a phone to talk to one. A white woman in that black neighborhood was in great danger, they explained. The slums of Cleveland , Detroit , Los Angeles , and especially Chicago , or any other major city are littered with filth and disease and the hatred of blacks toward whites. It’s the same in the L.A. barrio, my friend, and they aren’t singing Kumbaya, either. A recent mayor of L. A. declared he intended to take California back as Mexican territory. Do you consider that a Kumbaya moment? An “ America , The Beautiful” kind of moment? They call themselves “Reconquista”,  and they are there to do just that. They murder and steal from Americans who live near the Mexican border in Arizona , but our government says Arizonans can’t protect themselves from the marauders. 
Is the America where you find massive amounts of illegal drugs and thick lines of cocaine on glass -top coffee tables to be considered beautiful? That’s what illegal aliens brought to our once beautiful America . Is that meth lab in the house down the street beautiful? Is the heroin epidemic now seizing the weak in America your idea of “ America , The Beautiful”? Singing it to us in foreign languages is repugnant to us, and it makes us resentful. Being sung by a young woman who is forced by her family to wear the clothing demanded by the oppression of her religion is also repulsive. 
Do you have children? Are they allowed to wear a symbol of our country on their clothing? America ’s schools don’t allow American flags anywhere anymore. Where are your children going to learn of a “beautiful” America ? It won’t be at their school. They are being taught how wonderful Islam is, and to celebrate Cinco de Mayo when their brother may be shot at by an Afghan terrorist or an alien illegally crossing our border to bring harm to our country in the form of theft, drugs, prostitution, or terrorism. Watch the news; you’ll see how often there’s a squabble over such things, and how angry it is making real Americans. You know, those folks that say the Pledge of Allegiance and mean it. Probably like your mom and dad. Those that came here to flee oppression and build an America they were also willing to die to defend. Not the ones who want to “fundamentally change America ”. 
How about Watts, or South Central Los Angeles ? Boston , or New York , or Patterson , New Jersey ? Do you ever have a desire to participate in or watch the Boston marathon again? You think the Tsarnaov brothers are a part of beautiful America ? 
Beautiful? No, it isn’t. Not anymore. Huge numbers of Muslims that threaten the white residents of Wylie , Texas by moving into a new neighborhood and holding closed, secret meetings in the park, intimidating white children, and frightening the elderly don’t make this a beautiful America . 
Illegal people from all over the world enter America through wide open borders and suffer no consequences. Lovely people like MS 13 and other gangs, and terrorists from the Middle East .. Mexican, Central and South Americans serve as donkeys, as beasts of burden, bringing thousands of tons of illegal drugs into America , and you want to celebrate their heritage? Why? And you want me to celebrate their heritage with you? Have you all lost your collective minds? 
At least ten thousand people were brought into the New York City area as prostitutes to serve the football fans that came to see the Super Bowl. Many of them were children. The FBI has been busy rounding them up. Some are only 13 years old. Is that your America , of which you sing in a foreign voice? Human trafficking in this country is rampant
; do you suppose a kid was given an ice-cold Coke to enjoy after some sweaty, grunting Denver or Seattle fan finished his sex act with her? I hope it makes you shudder and puke. Those kids were mostly brought into our country from a foreign land. Is that what you want them to know of America , and sing it in their language? What about the adult women who were victimized in that group of ten thousand? Know this – they do not come willingly. They do not perform those acts willingly. And they sure as hell don’t do it to be in the land of Coca Cola …. They hate us because we allow it to happen. I hate to tell you what they would do to you with a bottle of Coke, and that I know of because I am an R. N. who witnessed such things in an emergency room. That’s not “ America , The Beautiful”. 
Well, Timothy, change for the better under liberals is just not going to happen, and the backlash I’m giving you is only a polite synopsis of the feelings millions of us have about those immigrants who speak different languages and come from cultures that we do not embrace, nor do we want our children or grandchildren exposed to them or their culture except from afar. We do not want our grandchildren celebrating Cinco de Mayo and being told that they cannot display the American flag on their own home or a T-shirt. It makes us angry, and where we once practiced tolerance and helped those who wish to assimilate, we now shun and cower in fright, or watch violent clashes between cultures on the nightly news. And we arm ourselves against the invasion. 
If Coca Cola is going to be politically correct and sing Kumbaya while hoping that we who are outside that closed executive neighborhood of yours enjoy a cold refreshing Coke and smile at your distinctly anti-American silly song, you’re badly mistaken. You’re going to watch your sales plummet. You’re going to watch others show real patriotism, like Anheuser Busch, and applaud the way they show appreciation to our soldiers who are killing the relatives of those Muslims in Detroit and Patterson who would spit on you, or worse, if you went to their neighborhoods. And I’ll be at those Independence Day parades, applauding our troops and those who know the real America the way it is supposed to be and was before liberals took over and convoluted and ignored our laws, spat on our Constitution, and ruined our America . 
I’m through supporting companies that support our enemies. Bye-bye, Coke. It used to be America ’s drink. Now your company is America ’s poison.

The most miraculous event I witnessed showed how a tooth saved a sergeant’s life!
Christmas Eve morning a soldier came into our clinic at the Ibn Sina Hospital in downtown Baghdad covered in his own blood. He recounted an incredible story. Early Christmas Eve morning, two squads were assigned to sweep and clear two adjacent homes where Iraq terrorists were holed-up. The patient, SGT C, was leading one of those assault squads. The other squad hit their target first.
SGT C said that he heard a lot of small arms fire and yelling, so he thought he would round the corner and size up the situation before advancing his team. Unfortunately, as he turned the corner, he found himself staring directly into the barrel of a 9mm automatic pistol. SGT C said he never had time to be scared, he just knew he was dead. The terrorist pulled the trigger and, miraculously, SGT C found himself still standing. He figured the bullet had missed. He advanced on the Iraqi, who immediately surrendered. After the enemy was rounded up, SGT C said he started to feel light! headed and one of his soldiers insisted that he proceed to the hospital. He realized at this time that he had lost his front tooth in the gun fight. He figured the ballistic shock from the weapon’s blast had knocked it loose. He was wrong.

When he presented early that morning Major Kimberly Perkins, our oral surgeon, took a panograph and discovered the incredible truth. The 9mm bullet did NOT miss SGT C. He was hit directly in the face. The bullet entered just below his nose where it impacted the apex of #8. The energy from the bullet was transferred to the tooth, literally ejecting the tooth from its socket, and stopping the bullet in its track. Other than the missing tooth, the majority of SGT C’s injuries were confined to soft tissue.

Note Found in Dud Shell Written by Jewish Slave Laborers"	Fiction! 				2015/03/17	"Good WW II Story




This story is confirmed in Elmer Bendiner’s book, The Fall of Fortresses.
*Sometimes, it’s not really just luck.*
Elmer Bendiner was a navigator in a B-17 during WW II. He tells this story of a World War II bombing run over Kassel, Germany , and the unexpected result of a direct hit on their gas tanks. “Our B-17, the Tondelayo, was barraged by flak from Nazi antiaircraft guns. That was not unusual, but on this particular occasion our gas tanks were hit.
Later, as I reflected on the miracle of a 20 millimeter shell piercing the fuel tank without touching off an explosion, our pilot, Bohn Fawkes, told me it was not quite that simple. “On the morning following the raid, Bohn had gone down to ask our crew chief for that shell as a souvenir of unbelievable luck. .
The crew chief told Bohn that not just one shell but 11 had been found in the gas tanks. 11 unexploded shells where only one was sufficient to blast us out of the sky. It was as if the sea had been parted for us. A near-miracle, I thought.
Even after 35 years, so awesome an event leaves me shaken, especially after I heard the rest of the story from Bohn.
“He was told that the shells had been sent to our armorers to be defused. The armorers told him that our Intelligence Unit had picked them up. They could not say why at the time, but Bohn eventually sought out the answer. “Apparently when the armorers opened each of those shells, they found no explosive charge. They were as clean as a whistle and just as harmless.
Empty? Not all of them! One contained a carefully rolled piece of paper. On it was a scrawl in Czech. The Intelligence people scoured our base for a man who could read Czech. Eventually they found one to decipher the note. It set us marveling.g.
Translated, the note read:
“This is all we can do for you now…
Using Jewish slave labor is never a good idea.”

Carrollton , Texas
========================================
Date: Wednesday, September 2, 2009, 12:38 PM
The Truth About the Health Care Bills – Michael Connelly, Ret. Constitutional Attorney 08.24.09
Well, I have done it! I have read the entire text of proposed House Bill 3200: The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009. I studied it with particular emphasis from my area of expertise, constitutional law. I was frankly concerned that parts of the proposed law that were being discussed might be unconstitutional. What I found was far worse than what I had heard or expected.
To begin with, much of what has been said about the law and its implications is in fact true, despite what the Democrats and the media are saying. The law does provide for rationing of health care, particularly where senior citizens and other classes of citizens are involved, free health care for illegal immigrants, free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession.
The Bill will also eventually force private insurance companies out of business and put everyone into a government run system. All decisions about personal health care will ultimately be made by federal bureaucrats and most of them will not be health care professionals. Hospital admissions, payments to physicians, and allocations of necessary medical devices will be strictly controlled.
However, as scary as all of that it, it just scratches the surface. In fact, I have concluded that this legislation really has no intention of providing affordable health care choices. Instead it is a convenient cover for the most massive transfer of power to the Executive Branch of government that has ever occurred, or even been contemplated. If this law or a similar one is adopted, major portions of the Constitution of the United States will effectively have been destroyed.
The first thing to go will be the masterfully crafted balance of power between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of the U.S. Government. The Congress will be transferring to the Obama Administration authority in a number of different areas over the lives of the American people and the businesses they own. The irony is that the Congress doesn’t have any authority to legislate in most of those areas to begin with. I defy anyone to read the text of the U.S. Constitution and find any authority granted to the members of Congress to regulate health care.
This legislation also provides for access by the appointees of the Obama administration of all of your personal healthcare information, your personal financial information, and the information of your employer, physician, and hospital. All of this is a direct violation of the specific provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures. You can also forget about the right to privacy. That will have been legislated into oblivion regardless of what the 3rd and 4th Amendments may provide.
If you decide not to have healthcare insurance or if you have private insurance that is not deemed “acceptable” to the “Health Choices Administrator” appointed by Obama there will be a tax imposed on you. It is called a “tax” instead of a fine because of the intent to avoid application of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. However, that doesn’t work because since there is nothing in the law that allows you to contest or appeal the imposition of the tax, it is definitely depriving someone of property without the “due process of law.
So, there are three of those pesky amendments that the far left hate so much out the original ten in the Bill of Rights that are effectively nullified by this law. It doesn’t stop there though. The 9th Amendment that provides: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people;” The 10th Amendment states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are preserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” Under the provisions of this piece of Congressional handiwork neither the people nor the states are going to have any rights or powers at all in many areas that once were theirs to control.
I could write many more pages about this legislation, but I think you get the idea. This is not about health care; it is about seizing power and limiting rights. Article 6 of the Constitution requires the members of both houses of Congress to “be bound by oath or affirmation” to support the Constitution. If I was a member of Congress I would not be able to vote for this legislation or anything like it without feeling I was violating that sacred oath or affirmation. If I voted for it anyway I would hope the American people would hold me accountable.
For those who might doubt the nature of this threat I suggest they consult the source. Here is a link to the Constitution:http://www.archives.gov/ex hibits/charters/constituti <http://www.archives.gov/ex%0Ahibits/charters/constituti> on_transcript.html
And another to the Bill of Rights: http://www.archives.gov/ex hibits/charters/bill_of_ri ghts_transcript.html
There you can see exactly what we are about to have taken from us.

IF YOU ARE USING MR. CLEAN MAGIC ERASERS….STOP!

HEADS UP ABOUT PRODUCTS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.WELL HE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT REGARDING MAGIC ERASERS AND SAID THAT THEY ARE SLOWLY BEING BANNED BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN THE INGREDIENT FORMALDEHYDE. YES THE CHEMICAL THEY
USE TO PRESERVE DEAD PEOPLE. IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS TO YOUNG CHILDREN AND CAN BE HARMFUL TO YOURSELF, SO PLEASE IF YOU ARE USING THEM, THROW THEM AWAY, DON’T BUY THEM ANYMORE AND PLEASE SEND THIS ON TO ANYONE WHOM YOU THINK MIGHT USE THEM, ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.
Example #2
Chemical Burns to Children 
One of my five year old’s favorite chores around the house is cleaning scuff marks off the walls, doors, and baseboards with either an Easy Eraser pad, or the real deal, a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. I purchased a package of Magic Erasers ages ago when they first came out. I remember reading the box, wondering what the “Magic” component was that cleaned crayon off my walls with ease. No ingredients were listed and absolutely no warnings were on the box, other than “Do not ingest.”
My package of the Scotchbrite Easy Erasers didn’t have a warning either and since my child knew not to eat the sponges and keep them out of reach of his little brother and sister, it was a chore I happily let him do.
If I had known that both brands (and others like them) contain a harmful alkaline or “base” chemical (opposite of acid on the pH scale) that can burn your skin, I never would have let my little boy handle them. As you can see from the picture, when the Scotchbrite Easy Eraser was rubbed against his face and chin, he received severe chemical burns.
At first, I thought he was being dramatic. I picked him up, put him on the counter top and washed his face with soap and water. He was screaming in pain. I put some lotion on his face – more agony. I had used a Magic Eraser to remove magic marker from my own knuckles a while back and I couldn’t understand why he was suddenly in pain. Then, almost immediately, the large, shiny, blistering red marks started to spread across his cheeks and chin.
I quickly searched Google.com for “Magic Eraser Burn” and turned up several results. I was shocked. These completely innocent looking white foam sponges can burn you?
I called our pediatrician, and of course got sent to voice mail. I hung up and called the Hospital and spoke to an Emergency Room nurse. She told me to call Poison Control. The woman at Poison Control said she was surprised nobody had sued these companies yet and walked me through the process of neutralizing the alkaline to stop my son’s face from continually burning more every second.
I had already, during my frantic phone calling, tried patting some numbing antibiotic cream on his cheeks, and later some Aloe Vera gel – both resulted in screams of pain. The Poison Control tech had me fill a bathtub with warm water, lay my son into it, cover him with a towel to keep him warm and then use a soft washcloth to rinse his face and chin with cool water for a continuous 20 minutes.
My son calmed down immediately. He told me how good it felt. I gave him a dose of Tylenol and after the twenty minutes was up, he got dressed in his Emergency Room doctor Halloween costume and off we went to the Hospital.
They needed to make sure the chemical burn had stopped burning, and examine his face to determine if the burn would need to be debrided (from my fuzzy recollection of hospital work, this means removing loose tissue from a burn location). My son was pretty happy at the hospital, they were very nice and called him “Doctor” and let him examine some of their equipment. The water had successfully stopped the burning and helped soothe a lot of the pain. I’m sure Tylenol was helping too.
They sent us home with more Aloe Vera gel, Polysporin antibiotic cream, and some other numbing burn creams. By the time we got home, my son was crying again. I tried applying some of the creams but he cried out in pain. Water seemed to be what worked the best.
After a rough night, I took the above photo in the morning. He was swollen and wouldn’t move his lips very much to avoid moving the skin on his taut cheeks. I was fighting back the tears, and I said, “Oh honey, I wish I could take it away from you. I wish I could take it off your face and put it on mine.” He was so shocked, he started to tear up a little and said, “Mom, no. You don’t want this on your face, it hurts so much. You would be hurting. Last night was terrible, I couldn’t sleep, and you wouldn’t be able to sleep either.” It just broke my heart into five trillion pieces – as much as he is hurting, he wouldn’t want me to be hurting in his place.
Today he is doing much better. The burns have started to scab over, and in place of red, raw, angry, skin we have a deeper red, rough healing layer. I can touch his skin now, without it stinging, and this morning he went back to Pre-School with Polysporin rubbed all over his face. He announced to the class, “I brought my face for Show and Tell!”
—
Note – he was doing fine as of Friday. Kudos to this diligent parent for informing us all.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hamas-tunnels/	The Hamas Underground Terror Network in Gaza	Truth!				2015/03/17	"A young IDF soldier’s experience in Gaza !

We went into Shuja’iya, to discover and destroy the Hamas’ terrorist tunnels. We discovered there an entire underground city, with multi-shaft, wide tunnels, with Wi-Fi & air-conditioning systems, concrete walls, and stocked to the ceiling with weapons and explosives. Some of the tunnels are so wide, that they can ride back and forwards on Vespa-type scooters. And then came the worst! The Hamas “fighters” started sending towards us 13- and 14-year-old Palestinian children, running at us, wearing explosive-laden suicide-bomber belts!! Those children were death-trapped, and became human bombs, by the community’s adults!! We were trained to fight adult soldiers or any other skilled adults, enabling us to defend our families and countrymen. But this?? We had no other option but, in self-defense, to shoot them at as far a range from us as we could, before the “responsible adult” that sent them used his mobile phone to detonate the belts, and kill us.” One of the injured soldiers ended up by saying, “I do not know if I’ll ever be able to sleep again; the pictures of those poor children, killed by my gun, will probably never leave me!”
————————————————————————————
Other Version:
This second example was found on the  website of the Daily Caller.
Very informative. Think about our Southern border
​Hamas Tunnels Used To Target Israel’s Kindergartens By Mordechai Ben-Menachem
Multiple media outlets report that Hamas’s offensive tunnel network – now known to have been composed of over forty attack tunnels dug underneath Israel’s border with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip – was set to be activated during the Jewish High Holidays (September 24th) as a mass terror attack.
The attack was meant to generate as many as ten thousand casualties, men, women and particularly children and hundreds of captives. Explosives were particularly placed underneath kindergartens to make certain that these “institutions” would be the first struck, even before anything else.
The IDF recently published the below map showing that tunnels were created in pairs, to empty out on both sides of nearby communities. The known cost of the infrastructure – each tunnel costs upward of some $1 million – clearly shows that Hamas was planning a coordinated mega-attack. It must be understood that use of even one tunnel would inevitably trigger Israeli retaliation against the entire network.
 
A map of a small portion of the tunnels meant to be used 9 weeks from now.
Revelations regarding the planned tunnel attack magnitude played a decisive role in the Israeli government’s rejection of a ceasefire proposed late Friday by Secretary of State John Kerry.
Unbelievably, Kerry actually proposed in his latest “cease-fire proposal” – none of which have been honored by Hamas so far – that Israel refrains from degrading remaining attack tunnels. This mind-boggling concept would necessarily be rejected by any sane government, of any country.
Israeli security sources, citing information acquired in interrogations of captured brigands, described a scenario under which hundreds of heavily armed Hamas fighters would have spilled out into Israel in the dead of night and within 10 minutes been positioned to infiltrate essentially all Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip. Waiting then in hiding until schools and kindergartens were occupied, the terrorists would then attempt to kill the children first, and then kill and kidnap as many Israelis as possible. The plot was set to take place during Jewish New Year, on September 24.
“It’s like the Underground, the Metro or the Subway,” Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. “These tunnels are all connected. I would describe it as Lower Gaza.”
Israeli Economy Minister Naftali Bennett said, “A whole city of terror tunnels has been found. Without the ground operation, we would have woken up one day to an Israeli 9/11.”
Except, the actual objective was to be five times 9/11.

This picture shows clearly the width of one of the tunnels, sufficient for wheeled vehicles to transverse it. Hamas did not build a “subway” system for Gaza residents. They built an infrastructure for one purpose, and one only, an industry of death.
Israeli military officials reported that the tunnels are stocked with tranquilizers, handcuffs, syringes, ropes and other materials used for subduing abductees, civilians and soldiers. The tunnels also had fantastic quantities of explosives and additional military materiel meant to be used in the up-coming mega attack. Much of these explosives had already been placed underneath Israeli kindergartens. Some of these tunnels were as deep as 30 meters underground.

Fantastic quantities of explosives were stored in every tunnel, meant to be used in a mega-attack on civilian communities and infrastructure.
Sources say the Gaza Strip war, Operation Protective Edge, could serve as a prelude for a more extensive underground war with the Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah. Perhaps, not ‘just’ in the Middle East.
The tunnels inside Gaza and under the Israeli border are not a secret project Hamas ran under the noses of Israel and the Palestinian public. Everyone in Gaza, knew that beneath Gaza, the City and all of its environs, a network of tunnels was being dug over the past five years, with an investment of tens of millions of dollars. Yet no one in Israel, public or military, was prepared for the scope of the tunnels – the danger that became clear in the past week or two.

Senior Hamas operatives show off their offensive tunnels to their spouses. Unbelievably, this is actually a picture of a Marriage taking place in the ‘place of death’.
In order to create this monstrosity, Hamas needed significant professional help; and this help had to have come from a large organization or state entity. This is not just the monetary aid it received from Qatar, America’s ally. This is professional guidance for the performance of such an underground feat. Perhaps Hamas could have used experts from the tunnels dug at Rafah under the Gaza-Egypt border, but those were significantly simpler, and did not demand any extraordinary investment or effort.

A Hamas operative climbing upward in a pier of one of the major tunnels. Notice the work on the sides of the tunnel.
Who supplied these quantities of material? Who planned what would be needed? How did Hamas acquire thousands of ampoules of tranquilizer, syringes and other, additional drugs to be used? These are far beyond the quantities and variety of what is needed by any civilian medical service.
How was all this brought in to the Gaza Strip? The logistics of this planned attack are the work of a well-organised military, not that of a militia or club. This was no amateur plan.
Observers note that attack scenarios lined up with recently revealed data about the sophistication, scope and nature of the offensive tunnel network. As previously reported here, this sophistication and know-how is being copied right now by Mexico-based Hezbollah agents along the Southern US border. Tunnels in Southern Lebanon, as in South US, are significantly more difficult to detect than those in the sandy terrain of the Gaza Strip.
“Hamas planned these tunnels for years, and planned to use them to kidnap soldiers,” Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Mordechai Almoz said. “[Now] they see the tunnels collapsing one after the other.” For the last two years, the Israeli army has sought to develop skills and equipment to fight in enemy tunnels and bunkers. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have used tunnels to operate command and control, to infiltrate Israel and abduct soldiers, to fire rockets and to conceal fighters amid invasion of the Gaza Strip.

‘HAND OF GOD SENT MISSILE INTO SEA’

Iron Dome operator: ‘I witnessed this miracle with my own eyes’ -JOE KOVACS
Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system is fired to intercept enemy rockets
More claims of divine intervention are being reported in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, with an operator of Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system saying he personally witnessed “the hand of God” diverting an incoming rocket out of harm’s way.
Israel Today translated a report from a Hebrew-language news site, which noted the Iron Dome battery failed three times to intercept an incoming rocket headed toward Tel Aviv last week.
The commander recalled: “A missile was fired from Gaza. Iron Dome precisely calculated [its trajectory]. We know where these missiles are going to land down to a radius of 200 meters. This particular missile was going to hit either the Azrieli Towers, the Kirya (Israel’s equivalent of the Pentagon) or [a central Tel Aviv railway station]. Hundreds could have died.
“We fired the first [interceptor]. It missed. Second [interceptor]. It missed. This is very rare. I was in shock. At this point we had just four seconds until the missile lands. We had already notified emergency services to converge on the target location and had warned of a mass-casualty incident.
Is God actually fighting for Israel in this conflict? Sound off in the WND Poll.
“Suddenly, Iron Dome (which calculates wind speeds, among other things) shows a major wind coming from the east, a strong wind that … sends the missile into the sea. We were all stunned. I stood up and shouted, ‘There is a God!’
“I witnessed this miracle with my own eyes. It was not told or reported to me. I saw the hand of God send that missile into the sea.”
Modern-day Israel is truly a divine wonder of the current age. Get the DVD series that shows how it survives “Against All Odds.”
The commander’s account is reminiscent of a recent newspaper headline which trumpeted the possibility of supernatural protection.

“Their God changes the path of our rockets in mid-air, said a terrorist,” was the headline in the July 18 edition of the Jewish Telegraph.
It was a partial quote from Barbara Ordman, who lives in Ma’ale Adumim on the West Bank.
Her exact quotation was: “As one of the terrorists from Gaza was reported to say when asked why they couldn’t aim their rockets more effectively: “We do aim them, but their God changes their path in mid-air.”
She opened her piece by noting: “In October 1956, [Israeli Prime Minister] David Ben Gurion was interviewed by CBS. He stated: ‘In Israel, in order to be a realist, you must believe in miracles.’”
Ordman also noted religious texts, specifically the Jerusalem Talmud, teaches Israelis not to depend on miracles for survival.
“It argues that we must not desist from our obligations and must not wait for miraculous intervention from the Supernatural,” she wrote.
Meanwhile, the Times of Israel reported a senior officer in Israel’s army said divine miracles protected his soldiers during fighting in the Gaza Strip.

IDF Col. Ofer Winter
Givati Brigade commander Col. Ofer Winter told the weekly publication Mishpacha that he “witnessed a miraculous occurrence, the likes of which he had never seen before during his military career.”
Winter indicated a predawn raid intended to use darkness as cover was delayed, forcing the soldiers to move toward their objective as sunrise was approaching.
With the troops in danger of being exposed at daybreak, Winter explained how heavy fog quickly descended to shroud their movements until their mission was accomplished.
“Suddenly a cloud protected us,” he said, referring to clouds the Bible says guided the ancient Israelites as they wandered in the desert. “Clouds of glory.”
Winter said only when the soldiers were in a secure position, the fog finally lifted.
“It really was a fulfillment of the verse ‘For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to give you victory,’” he said, quoting Deuteronomy 20:4.
Why does the Bible say believers will sit on the throne of Jesus Christ and judge angels? Find out in your personally autographed copy of “The Divine Secret” by Joe Kovacs right now, or get autographed copies of both “The Divine Secret” and the classic “Shocked by the Bible” bundled together!
The Times of Israel notes Winter made headlines over an official letter he sent to battalion and company commanders July 9, telling his subordinates that “history has chosen us to spearhead the fighting (against) the terrorist ‘Gazan’ enemy which abuses, blasphemes and curses the God of Israel’s (defense) forces.”
The dispatch came under fire from some, since it portrayed the Operation Protective Edge as a religious war against non-Jews. The Israeli government’s stated aim is to stop rocket attacks at Israel and destroy a network of tunnels dug under the border from Gaza used to launch terror attacks inside Israeli territory.
In his interview with Mishpacha, Winter defended his message, saying everyone finds God when in combat.
“Anyone who attacked me for the letter apparently has only seen weapons in pictures, was never in combat, and doesn’t know what fighting spirit is,” he said, revealing that before going into action his custom was to recite the blessing with which the ancient Israelite priests would bless the army before it went to war.
“When a person is in a life-threatening situation he connects with his deepest internal truths, and when that happens, even the biggest atheist meets God,” he said, claiming soldiers see so many miracles, “it is hard not to believe [in God].”

________________________________________________________
Dear Friends, As most of you know, my stepdaughter Erin has been missing since June 3rd.
We are pretty sure that she is no longer in our immediate geographic area.
The Cedar Rapids Police Department believes that she may have been “coerced” by a group of “Chicago boys.” We seem to have a pretty high amount of Chicago gang related activity in CR over the last few years. Apparently they have had a history of preying on white teenage girls. Erin may be one of their latest. Anyway, here we are nearly two months later and we still don’t know anything more that we did on the day we reported her missing.
Many of you have asked what you can do. Thanks to an email from a friend the other day, I finally have something for you to do. Please forward this email to everyone on your address list. If your employer will let you, email it to everyone at work. Ask them to email it to everyone on their list as well. The more people that see this the better. Hopefully if enough people see her picture in this email someone will see her in real life.
The second thing that you can do is to make sure that you hug a child in your life every day. If they are “too big to be hugged”, make sure that you find another way to let them know that they are loved by you. Don’t take it for granted that they know. Kids are short sighted. If the last thing that you said to them was not that you loved them, they tend to not remember the last time that you did tell them.
Thank you for forwarding this to everyone that you know.
This is the flyer that we have posted most recently. Feel free to distribute it as you see fit. If you have any other ideas on ways to get her picture in front of more people, email me.  cmmouse@rocketmail.com
Angels,
Carolyn
My apologies to anyone that gets this more than once. I am sending it to literally all of my address book. And some of you are in here twice.

Who Votes For This Guy?
Florida Republicans are not only throwing billions of your taxpayer dollars away by not expanding Medicaid for the second year in a row, but they’re throwing away even more by trying to pass legislation that would ban something that doesn’t exist, nor poses any threat, for the third year in a row:
Sharia law.
Sen. Alan Hays (R-Paranoia) is once again looking over his shoulder for imaginary individuals who want to impose foreign law or…..something.
Back in 2012, Hays chose Muslim Day in the capitol to make his move. It later failed. Last year,comparing it to something to be vaccinated against, Hays once again put Florida on notice for what critics called a “phantom menace.” And once again, it failed.
Now, perhaps thinking the third time will be the charm, Hays is back again, warning of the dangers of this still nonexistent problem:
A controversial measure dubbed an “anti-Sharia bill” advanced out of the Florida Senate on a 24-14 vote Monday.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, touted SB 286 as “an American bill.”
It would restrict judges from considering foreign law in matters of divorce, alimony, child support and custody.
Under the language of the bill, an order of a foreign court would not be enforceable if it “offends the public policy of the state.”
“There is no record of Sharia law being implemented in the courts of Florida or any other state,” Sen. Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat said, in opposition.
Ah, but records and reality aside, any offense to Hays’ imagination must be dealt with, regardless of all the other important issues the legislature should be dealing with, like Medicaid expansion, water pollution and other things that pose a real threat to Floridians.
Nope. Republicans would rather waste time and money running out the clock on imaginary threats and this guy’s salary.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-coffins/	FEMA Coffins and Internment Camps	Fiction!  & Unproven Conspiracy Theory!				2015/03/17	"OBAMA QUIETLY ORDERS ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DISPOSABLE FEMA COFFINS
 


Obama has been operating behind the scenes to prepare an action in case of an American revolt that will not only squash a revolution, but kill many of its participants. The first step of this action would be to disarm the American people, and throw anyone that is, or might be, a threat into a detention center—a FEMA camp. During the course of the revolt, many will die, both in battle and in the camps—an inevitable circumstance Obama is already preparing for.
The current President of the United States, amongst other things, has already ordered $1 Billion dollars worth of disposable coffin liners. Around the country is stored the 5 million, what will be, FEMA coffins in various locations.
According to land owners, the CDC is leasing land in order to store the strangely large amounts of coffins on their land. A man who recently stumbled across a stockpile of the top-secret government purchase claims the, what look like plastic bins, to be, “multi-use cremation containers.”
The containers are excessively large for one person, and as the commentator notes, could hold 3 or 4 bodies, maybe more. He continues to state that the containers, under patent # 5,425,163, “are cremation containers for multiple bodies,” that, “generate very little pollution.”
Along with this, the Department of Homeland Security has also ordered their own stockpile of 14 million body bags. What could cause the government to make such purchases in anticipation of so many deaths?
The next purchase seemed to shed a little more light on the subject. The DHS ordered 140 million long-life meals or MREs (meals ready to eat). Now of course our military does have the need for MREs as our boys overseas eat them regularly, but they are ordered by their military division, not the DHS.
The DHS is anticipating the enactment of FEMA camps all across the nation—and of course when you incur prisoners, you must feed them. This along with the several secretive locations of FEMA camps that are just waiting to need, makes these purchases extremely frightening.
What do you think—is Obama really willing to kill Americans to stay in power?

 The photo of the youngster shows clearly the her distinctive right eye, where the pupil runs into the blue-green iris.

The new poster of Madeleine
It is this distinguishing mark that will identify Madeleine to those on the lookout for her, according to aunt and uncle John and Diane McCann.
 The Glasgow couple aim to distribute the appeal poster, which features the Crimestoppers telephone number, as far afield as they can.
 Family friend Andrew Renwick told Sky News that support for the search had been ‘overwhelming’ and her family were extremely grateful.

Her right eye Mrs McCann said: ‘The purpose of the poster is to highlight the distinction in Madeleine’s eye.
 ‘We want to make the most of it, because we know her hair could potentially be cut or dyed.’
 Mr McCann added: ‘The poster was designed by a friend of the family and I’ve begun Emailing it to acquaintances in different parts of the world.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/777-anne-graham-lotz/	An Urgent Call for Prayer from Anne Graham Lotz	Truth! 				2015/03/17	"


As you may know, my husband is in declining health. I am no longer traveling and speaking as much as I have for the last 26 years since I am staying home to care for him. As a result, I have had time to be quiet and listen more to the whispers of the Spirit. He has revealed things to me in the stillness that I’m not sure I would have heard in my former busyness.


One of the things He has impressed on me is that we are living at the end of human history as we know it. In light of this, He has given me some practical assignments. One was to be the Honorary Chair for the National Day of Prayer 2014 this past May. He gave me the message I was to deliver, which was from Joel 1…the Day of the Lord is at hand. It was a message warning that judgment is coming.
Just recently, He has given me another assignment, which is to call His people in our nation to prayer. This assignment came indirectly from a Syrian pastor through a National Day of Prayer attendee. In obedience, I am blowing the trumpet…sounding the alarm…issuing a national prayer initiative entitled 7 7 7: An Urgent Call to Prayer. The Call is for God’s people to pray for each of the first seven days in the seventh month—July 1-7. Then on the 7th day, July 7, we are to pray and fast for 7 hours. The purpose is…
· For God the Father to restrain, protect, and deliver His people from the evil that has come into our world.
· For God the Son to be exalted, magnified, and glorified in His church, in our nation, and in our lives.
· For God the Holy Spirit to fall on us in a fresh way, compelling the church to repent of sin and our nation to return to faith in the living God, resulting in a great national spiritual awakening.
I’m asking you to partner with me, and send out the word to everyone on your email address list, or who follows you on facebook or twitter. I will be sending out an eBlast this week and next, which you can access at http://www.annegrahamlotz.com/events/urgent-call-to-prayer/. Please feel free to use it, and place your name in the paragraph that includes mine to make it more personal for your constituents. Feel free also to forward this letter.
I will provide a prayer I have written for each of the 7 days to help unite us in one spirit and one voice as we cry out to God. Those who receive the eBlast are invited to sign up for the daily email prayers. Please be assured there is no other agenda in this initiative. This is not about promoting anything or anyone. This is all about calling God’s people together to pray, before it’s too late, and judgment falls on our nation.
Please let me hear back from you as soon as possible. Time is short.
Urgently,
Blow the trumpet…sound the alarm…for the day of the Lord is coming. It is close at hand– Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God… Joel 2:1, 13

https://www.truthorfiction.com/lowes-flag-doormats/	Veteran Complained to Lowe's After Discovering That They Were SellingAmerican Flag Doormats	Truth! but Inaccurate Details!				2015/03/17	" 
Lowes Selling American Flag Door Mats … 
Probably made in China 


Lowe’s is now selling American flag doormats. 
As Memorial day just passed and the 4th of July is approaching, many stores are trying to increase their profits. Needless to say, the selling of American Flag doormats has many Veterans upset. Veterans feel that they fought for the American Flag, many losing their lives, and many permanently injured for the freedoms that the American Flag represents, yet Lowe’s is now selling the American Flag as a doormat, “something to be walked on, and something to wipe your feet on”, as one veteran put it. “Are they slapping our faces, or what?”, asked another veteran. 
The V.F.W, the American Legion, and several other organizations were immediately contacted. A veteran with 33 years in the U.S. Navy, had gone to Lowe’s to buy $300.00 worth of lumber to build a fence, but when he saw the American Flag doormat, he flipped out, made Lowe’s take back the lumber and refund his money. Several others walked out of the store. 
At the Lowe’s in N. Charleston , SC , the manager took all the doormats off of display because of complaints, and called Lowe’s headquarters to report the consumers’ and veterans’ complaints. 
Those who grew up respecting the American Flag, and those who fought to defend it, would never let the American Flag touch the ground, much less use it as a doormat, to walk on or wipe your feet on! 
Most likely these doormats are made in China , but they are distributed by: Mohawk Home 3032 Sugar Valley Rd., NW Sugar Valley, Georgia 30746. 
Please pass this on to as many people you can. Some of us still respect and love America and our Flag, and what it represents!

That old adage applies here. . . “there are two sides to every story” . . .we don’t always get the truth from the media.
One of my favorite rants…the liberal controlled media…television news…newspapers…magazines…radio…all continue to show 12 year old Trayvon…NOT 17 year old Trayvon…they continue to show the 5 year old picture BECAUSE it helps to cement in your mind the little, cute, hoodie wearing youngster who was stalked by this monster In reality..”little Trayvon”…at the time of his death…stood almost 6’2″ tall…weighed 175 muscular pounds…had numerous run ins with authorities (both at school and local police)…had been stopped and almost arrested two days before his death for…smacking a bus driver in the face…because the driver refused to let him ride for free…he was released because the driver was told not to press charges by the bus company and to continue on his route.
When “little Trayvon” was suspended at school…it was not only because he tried to bring a little marijuana in with him…he was in possession of wedding rings and other jewelry…watches etc. that he said he “found” along with a large screwdriver…while on the way to school that day…the jewelry was turned over to the Police by the school. I am not trying to say this was a good or bad shooting…
And, I am not trying to say this kid deserved to die…I am saying…the media in the USA is controlled by liberals who twist and distort what you see and hear in order for you to see things their way! What they want you to see the way they want you to see it!

https://www.truthorfiction.com/brian-kolfage/	U.S.A.F. Veteran Brian Kolfage’s letter to President Obama	Confirmed Authorship!				2015/03/17	" Courageous Letter From Triple Amputee Veteran To Obama On Presidents Day Goes Viral


Dear President Obama,
My name is Brian Kolfage, I’m a triple amputee and retired Air Force veteran who was severely wounded on September 11, 2004 in Iraq.
I nearly died in a war that most of your colleagues supported overwhelmingly, including the two presidents who came before you. Many citizens may not agree with waging war in Iraq to free the oppressed Iraqi citizens, but it’s something that warriors like myself have no control over. I joined to serve my country and to better my life. I’ve seen things that you could never imagine, and they have made me the person I am today.
Mr. Obama, even though we have extreme opposite views, we have one thing in common, we both attended school in Hawaii. However, that’s where the similarities end. You see, as you attended your exclusive, private school, I would ride my bike to Kaimuki High School in one of the roughest areas in Hawaii. Every morning I would ride past Punahou, the exclusive private school you attended and I would notice all of the Bentleys, Maseratis, and fancy foreign cars that all the kids were dropped off in; wow it must have been extremely rough in Hawaii living that life, right? I could only imagine what it was like to have that kind of money. Fortunately for you, not many people are aware of the school that you and the upper class citizens of Hawaii attended. The tuition to attend your exclusive, private school was more than it cost me to obtain a Bachelor’s degree in Architecture from the University of Arizona. You talk a big game when it comes to financial inequality, yet I’m quite sure you have no idea what it’s truly like to have to sacrifice. You were one of the elitist children in Hawaii.
After High School, we each chose very different paths. You were able to attend America’s finest Ivy League schools, while I pursued a career in the military, in hopes of earning a degree. What we have in life as children usually helps to set the tone for how we achieve success later in life. I worked to get where I am today, while it was HANDED TO YOU….Mr. Inequality.
I volunteered to go to Iraq on both of my deployments, and the second time I begged to go even after I wasn’t selected. During that second deployment, I was ultimately placed on the team where I would lose both legs and my dominant arm. Even though many Americans were against the war in Iraq, I’ve never asked myself if it was worth it after losing 3 of my limbs.
I am frequently reminded of the many young Iraqi children who would beg me for water, food, and toys while I was stationed in Iraq. Children, who in all aspects made the poorest of poor American children look rich. You have no idea what it really means to be poor. It’s laughable that you, who would have no idea what it means to be poor would so frequently play the inequality card.
While I was in Iraq, our mission was to liberate the Iraqi citizens from a tyrant and that’s what we did. Never forget, it was your people who sent us there, like the Clintons, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi & Carl Levin. However, since the day you busted onto the scene you’ve been talking about ending the war and pulling the troops out, not understanding the blood sweat and tears that so many Americans and Iraqi’s invested. And with complete disregard for every life sacrificed, every limb lost, and every broken family, you bailed on our mission to pursue an agenda that was completely centered on your re-election in 2012. If you didn’t bail on Iraq you were worried that you may not get re-elected and that’s a fact. Just before elections on Oct 11, 2012 you said “Al Qaeda is on the run and Osama bin Laden is dead.” Look at Iraq now, they are in shambles and the Al Qaeda flag is flying freely. Clearly, you’re unfit for duty as a Commander in Chief. You put your own agenda ahead of America’s agenda, and now you have single handedly ruined and destroyed nearly everything we gained in Iraq. It clearly means nothing to you, because the only thing that you’ve personally invested in that country was a promise to bail on them. However, people like me gave limbs, friends have died, and we’ve watched families destroyed by war’s aftermath.
I’m not placing blame on you for the war, I’m placing blame on you for destroying what we’ve worked so hard to build. You’re not a leader, you’re a community organizer. A leader would have stood up regardless of the situation and put America’s agenda first and that is ensuring a secure Iraq even after 10 years of war. But, you placed Barack first, just as Robert Gates confirmed in his new book. I can’t help but think of those poor kids who I gave water and toys to 11 years ago. They’re probably 15 or 16 years old now, and I can only imagine what it’s like for them to have their nation being torn apart yet again; all because of your poor leadership qualities. Regardless of why we went to Iraq, its water under the bridge. We went there, we waged war, and we not only owed it to our KIA’s but we owed it to the citizens of Iraq. We invaded their country and turned it upside down, and you bailed on them. You bailed on our soldiers and you’ve wasted every death and every limb, it’s all for nothing. And to make matters worse you blame others for your failures
You’re just another elitist rich thug who’s pretended to live the rough life growing up in the inner-city. You’re only worried about your own agenda and furthering your party instead of taking care of Americans. Your inability to be a leader at some of the most critical points has caused both of our wars to fail. You’ve been a joke to most of our veteran community and we have no faith in your ability to lead.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/hobby-lobby-investments/	Hobby Lobby’s Retirement Plan Invests in Contraception Manufacturers	Truth!  & Pending Investigation!				2015/03/17	" Hobby Lobby’s Hypocrisy: The Company’s Retirement Plan Invests in Contraception Manufacturers




When Obamacare compelled businesses to include emergency contraception in employee health care plans, Hobby Lobby, a national chain of craft stores, fought the law all the way to the Supreme Court. The Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate, the company’s owners argued, forced them to violate their religious beliefs. But while it was suing the government, Hobby Lobby spent millions of dollars on an employee retirement plan that invested in the manufacturers of the same contraceptive products the firm’s owners cite in their lawsuit.
Documents filed with the Department of Labor and dated December 2012—three months after the company’s owners filed their lawsuit—show that the Hobby Lobby 401(k) employee retirement plan held more than $73 million in mutual funds with investments in companies that produce emergency contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices, and drugs commonly used in abortions. Hobby Lobby makes large matching contributions to this company-sponsored 401(k).
Several of the mutual funds in Hobby Lobby’s retirement plan have holdings in companies that manufacture the specific drugs and devices that the Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, is fighting to keep out of Hobby Lobby’s health care policies: the emergency contraceptive pills Plan B and Ella, and copper and hormonal intrauterine devices.
These companies include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which makes Plan B and ParaGard, a copper IUD, and Actavis, which makes a generic version of Plan B and distributes Ella. Other holdings in the mutual funds selected by Hobby Lobby include Pfizer, the maker of Cytotec and Prostin E2, which are used to induce abortions; Bayer, which manufactures the hormonal IUDs Skyla and Mirena; AstraZeneca, which has an Indian subsidiary that manufactures Prostodin, Cerviprime, and Partocin, three drugs commonly used in abortions; and Forest Laboratories, which makes Cervidil, a drug used to induce abortions. Several funds in the Hobby Lobby retirement plan also invested in Aetna and Humana, two health insurance companies that cover surgical abortions, abortion drugs, and emergency contraception in many of the health care policies they sell.
In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, the Greens object to covering Plan B, Ella, and IUDs because they claim that these products can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman’s uterus—a process the Greens consider abortion. But researchers reject the notion that emergency contraceptive pills prevent implantation the implantation of a fertilized egg. Instead, they work by delaying ovulation or making it harder for sperm to swim to the egg. (Copper IUDs, which are also a form of birth control, can prevent implantation.) The Green’s contention that the pills cause abortions is a central pillar of their argument for gutting the contraception mandate. Yet, for years, Hobby Lobby’s health insurance plans did cover Plan B and Ella. It was only in 2012, when the Greens considered filing a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, that they dropped these drugs from the plan.
A website Hobby Lobby set up to answer questions about the Supreme Court case states that its 401(k) plan comes with “a generous company match.” In 2012, Hobby Lobby contributed $3.8 million to its employee savings plans, which had 13,400 employee participants at the beginning of that year.
The information on Hobby Lobby’s 401(k) investments is included in the company’s 2013 annual disclosure to the Department of Labor. The records contain a list, dated December 31, 2012, of 24 funds that were included in its employer-sponsored retirement plan. MorningStar, an investment research firm, provided Mother Jones with the names of the companies in nine of those funds as of December 31, 2012. Each fund’s portfolio consists of at least dozens if not hundreds of different holdings.
All nine funds—which have assets of $73 million, or three-quarters of the Hobby Lobby retirement plan’s total assets—contained holdings that clashed with the Greens’ stated religious principles.
Hobby Lobby and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the conservative group that provided Hobby Lobby with legal representation, did not respond to questions about these investments or whether Hobby Lobby has changed its retirement plan.
In their Supreme Court complaint, Hobby Lobby’s owners chronicle the many ways in which they avoid entanglements with objectionable companies. Hobby Lobby stores do not sell shot glasses, for example, and the Greens decline requests from beer distributors to back-haul beer on Hobby Lobby trucks.
Similar options exist for companies that want to practice what’s sometimes called faith-based investing. To avoid supporting companies that manufacture abortion drugs—or products such as alcohol or pornography—religious investors can turn to a cottage industry of mutual funds that screen out stocks that religious people might consider morally objectionable. The Timothy Plan and the Ave Maria Fund, for example, screen for companies that manufacture abortion drugs, support Planned Parenthood, or engage in embryonic stem cell research. Dan Hardt, a Kentucky financial planner who specializes in faith-based investing, says the performances of these funds are about the same as if they had not been screened. But Hobby Lobby’s managers either were not aware of these options or chose not to invest in them.

OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ALL I HAVE HEARD WAS ABOUT A HOODED MAN IN FLORIDA AND NOT A PEEP ABOUT THIS MAN BEING EXECUTED. WHICH PERSON WAS MORE IMPORTANT?? MY ANSWER IS, NEITHER ONE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER. SO WHY HAS NO ONE HEARD ABOUT Youcef Nadarkhani COULD IT JUST BE OH SO SIMPLE AS HIS SKIN COLOR?
Christian Youcef Nadarkhani has been executed in Iran. He is the pastor who has been imprisoned and found guilty by the courts in Iran of being a Christian. Now he’s been executed in spite of international appeals to spare his life. He was hanged today. Where is the outcry from the White House over the murder of this innocent Christian minister? Where is the outcry from the church in America and around the world, and last but not least, where is the outcry from the Media??? The silence is deafening!

U.S. Navy Removes Bibles from military hotel lodgings.
 

The U.S. Navy has instructed housekeepers to remove Gideon-placed Bibles from every hotel room on its military bases after it received a letter from the atheist group Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF).
“We were told today, June 23, 2014, that due to a new policy by the CEO of NEXCOM, Rear Admiral Robert J. Bianchi, we were to remove the Bibles from the rooms,” a housekeeper told AFA in an email. “They told us to put them in boxes, where they would be taken to a donation center somewhere.”
NEXCOM (Navy Exchange Service Command) issued the directive to bases offering hotel accommodations, ordering them to impound Bibles from 34 Navy Lodge locations and 24,000 Navy Gateway Inns & Suites guest rooms on Navy bases worldwide.
The directive orders lodge managers to contact base commanders and Chaplains and facilitate removing the Bibles and other “religious material currently in the guest rooms.”
The Air Force tried unsuccessfully to remove Bibles from its lodgings in 2012, but after public outcry, the Air Force reversed itself.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/nbc-leno-obama/	NBC Got Rid of Leno Because of Obama Jokes	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"WHY NBC GOT RID OF THE FUNNIEST MAN ON LATE NIGHT – JAY LENO
 

News is leaking out from Hollywood executives in-the-know that the Obama White House had been leaning on, pressuring executives at NBC for the last two years to replace Jay Leno because the comedian was criticizing President Obama every night. Obama didn’t like it and considered it a racist attack on him.
Since his inauguration in Jan. 2009 Obama had enjoyed three years of very, very friendly routines from all the late night comics on ABC, CBS, and Leno at NBC – there was no criticism at all.
But after data came to light that $100’s of millions had been spent on First Family vacations during a recession, Mrs. Obama’s unpopular new laws that changed food in America’s schools and other negative news including the disastrous Obamacare rollout & website mess, Jay Leno took his comedy to a different level and his ratings skyrocketed – none of the other comics were so bold.
THESE ONE-LINERS MIGHT BE THE REASON NBC GOT RID OF THE FUNNIEST MAN ON LATE NIGHT – JAY LENO
Of course NBC was on board when Jay Leno went after Republican George W. Bush every night for 8 years but they couldn’t stomach the fact that Leno’s jokes about Obama were always right on target about the first black president…and left-leaning Democrat executives at NBC were being harassed by Obama himself who thought the comedy was a racist attack on him.
GOLDEN OLDIES FROM JAY: “I was going to start off tonight with an Obama joke, but I don’t want to get audited by the IRS.”
On NSA surveillance: “We wanted a president who listens to all Americans – now we have one.”
On a new IRS commissioner: “He’s called ‘acting commissioner’ because he has to act like the scandal doesn’t involve the White House.”
On closing the Guantanamo prison for terrorists: “If he really wants to close it, turn it into a government-funded solar power company. The doors will be shut in a month.”
Concerning the Benghazi, Associated Press, and IRS scandals: “Remember in the old days when President Obama’s biggest embarrassment was Joe Biden?”
On Obama saying he didn’t know about the IRS scandal: “He was too busy not knowing anything about Benghazi to not know anything about the IRS.”
“The White House has a new slogan about Benghazi : Hope and change the subject.”
“It’s casual Friday, which means that at the White House, they’re casually going through everybody’s phone calls and records.”
“It is not looking good for President Obama. Today his teleprompter took the fifth.”
“Fox News has changed its slogan from ‘Fair and Balanced’ to ‘See, I told you so!'”
On Obama’s commencement address: “He told the young graduates their future is bright unless, of course, they want jobs.”
On a Chicago man who set a record for riding a Ferris wheel: “The only other way to go around and around in a circle that many times is to read the official report on Benghazi.”
On White House claims of ignorance on the scandals: “They took ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ out of the Pentagon and moved it into the White House.”
Now the last and I think best!– “These White House scandals are not going away anytime soon. It’s gotten so bad that People in Kenya are now saying he’s 100 percent American.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/netanyahu-hamas/	Netanyahu Statement to Hamas	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu just made the following speech in front of the Knesset:

 
To Ismail Haniya, and the leaders and operatives of Hamas:
We, the people of Israel, owe you a huge debt of gratitude. You have succeeded where we have failed. Because never before, in the history of the modern State of Israel, has the Jewish people been so united, like one person with one heart. You stole three of our most precious children, and slaughtered them in cold blood. But before we could discover the horrible truth, we had 18 days of pain and anxiety while we searched for them, during which our nation united as never before, in prayer, in hopes, in mutual support.
And now, as you continue to launch deadly missiles indiscriminately , intended to maim and murder as many civilians as possible, while you take cowardly refuge behind your own civilians – you continue to inspire us to hold strongly onto our newly discovered unity. Whatever disputes we Jews may have with each other, we now know that we have one common goal: we will defeat you.
But we are offering you now one last chance. Within 24 hours , all rocket fire – and I mean all rocket fire – will cease. Completely. Forever.
I give you formal notice that our tanks are massed at the Gaza border, with artillery and air support at the ready. We have already dropped leaflets over the northern parts of the Gaza strip, warningcivilians of our impending arrival, and that they should evacuate southward, forthwith. If you fail to meet our ultimatum, we are coming in, and, with God’s help, this time we will not leave. Every centimeter of land that we conquer will be annexed to Israel, so that there will never be anotherattack launched at our civilians from there.
Even so, we will continue to keep the door open to allow you to surrender gracefully. The moment you announce that you are laying down arms, we will halt our advance, and there we will draw our new borders. If you continue to attack our citizens, we will continue to roll southwards, driving you out of territory that you will never again contaminate with your evil presence.
It pains me deeply that your civilians will be made homeless. But we did not choose this war; you did. And if our choice is between allowing our citizens to be targeted mercilessly by your genocidal savagery, versus turning your civilians into refugees, I regret that we must choose thelatter. If only you loved your people as much as you hate ours, this war would never have happened.
To the rest of the world: Israel has tired of your ceaseless chidings that we should “show restraint”. When you have your entire population under constant missile fire from an implacable enemy whose stated goal is the murder every man, woman and child in your land, then you may come and talk to us about “restraint”. Until then, we respectfully suggest that you keep your double standards to yourselves. This time, Hamas has gone too far, and we will do whatever we have to in order to protect our population.
Hamas, once again, I thank you for bringing our people together with such clarity of mind and unity of purpose. The people of Israel do not fear the long road ahead.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/malaysia-airlines-370/	Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Conspiracy Theories	Pending Investigation!				2015/03/17	"  BY CHRIS GAYOMALI
Details concerning the sudden, Saturday disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 continue to trickle in. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of Malaysia’s Civil Aviation Authority, said the missing Boeing 777 carrying 227 passengers an “unprecedented mystery.”
Here’s what we do know: The flight disappeared on Friday night/Saturday morning en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane was at cruising altitude (35,000 feet) and weather was more or less clear. Air traffic controllers in Vietnam say contact with the crew disappeared about 120 nautical miles east of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu, and radar signals suggest the plane may have turned around before losing contact.
And yet, nearly three whole days later, there are still no signs of the jet or its passengers. And an oil slick spotted in the South China sea originally thought to be a clue turned out to be a false lead:
Two Italian passengers said to be aboard the flight turned out to be safe on the ground, when they told authorities that their passports had, in fact, been stolen earlier. Someone aboard the flight was said to be using them, one of whom resembled a famous soccer player:
Adding another wrinkle to the case, the Wall Street Journal reports that airliners “such as the Malaysian jet also carry emergency beacons to transmit the aircraft’s location in the event of a mishap so that rescue teams can reach the site.”
These beacons, called emergency locator devices, are activated by impact on land or water, along with other emergency communications equipment. Malaysia’s aviation regulator said no signals were received from flight MH370’s beacon.
“There are many theories that have been said in the media,” Rahman said during a press conference. “Many experts around the world have contributed their expertise and knowledge about what could happen, what happened….We are puzzled as well.”
Naturally, conspiracy theories are already flying left and right on social media. One theory suggests the plane’s sudden disappearance is a “false flag” operation intentionally planted by CNN. Another claims that some relatives of the passengers onboard have even reported hearing their phones ring–but no one is answering.
Another, just as bizarre conspiracy theory suggests terrorists hijacked the plane, and have parked the plane intact in an abandoned hanger to use as “a weapon of mass destruction” in the future:
Over at Reddit, speculation is surprisingly measured. Says one user who claims to be a pilot:
At 35,000 feet they’d be able to travel another ~100-120 miles (far enough to reach the coast of Vietnam). Depending on the speed of the aircraft, it would take at least 15-30 minutes to reach the earth (or sea), giving them ample time to make a distress call. Throw in this weird stuff with the fake passports, and now reports that the plane apparently had attempted to turn back, and this makes me think something pretty sudden and catastrophic must have happened, and mechanical and/or pilot error seems unlikely in this case..
On Monday, China’s state-run media blasted the Malaysian government’s rescue efforts, arguing that initial reaction from the country “was not swift enough.” Currently, at least 45 ships and 22 aircraft from nine countries, including the U.S., China, and more, are partaking in a joint multi-national rescue effort. “If [the disappearance] is due to a deadly mechanical breakdown or pilot error, then Malaysia Airlines should take the blame,” wrote China’s Global Times in a scathing editorial. “If this is a terrorist attack, then the security check at the Kuala Lumpur airport and on the flight is questionable.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/potassium-iodide-fukushima/	Potassium Iodide Purchased by U.S. for Fukushima Leak	Unproven!  & Conspiracy Theory!				2015/03/17	"US Government Orders 14 Million Doses of Potassium Iodide. Huge purchase linked to ongoing Fukushima crisis? 
Paul Joseph Watson
Infowars.com
January 1, 2014
UPDATE: Plumes of mysterious steam rise from crippled nuclear reactor at Fukushima
The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 14 million doses of potassium iodide, the compound that protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents, to be delivered before the beginning of February.
Image: Potassium Iodide (YouTube).
According to a solicitation posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, the DHHS asks contractors to supply, “potassium iodide tablet, 65mg, unit dose package of 20s; 700,000 packages (of 20s),” a total of 14 million tablets. The packages must be delivered on or before February 1, 2014.
Potassium iodide helps block radioactive iodine from being absorbed by the thyroid gland and is used by victims of severe nuclear accidents or emergencies. Under current regulations, states with populations living within 10 miles of a nuclear plant are encouraged, but not required, to maintain a supply of potassium iodide.
A search of the FedBizOpps website returns no other results regarding the purchase of potassium iodide from any government agency, suggesting that the DHHS bulk buy of the tablets is unprecedented in recent times.
The ongoing crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has prompted concerns that the purchase is connected to the threat posed by radioactive debris washing up on the shores of the west coast or the potential for another natural disaster occurring in Japan which could impact the U.S.
“Governments usually respond to disasters very similarly; first move is to avoid panic,” writes The West Wire. “The Japanese didn’t want to panic the world, or tarnish their honor and now, as a consequence of their reluctance, Japanese citizens and international aid personal find themselves in a horrible state of being.”
“Panic is usually avoided by keeping their citizens as blind to the truth as possible, until confrontation with the truth becomes inevitable. The crucial question at this juncture; “would our government be reluctant about warning us of potential disaster, in an attempt to avoid panic?” 14 million doses of Potassium Iodide say that might just be the case.”
Last month it was revealed that 71 U.S. sailors who helped during the initial Fukushima relief efforts are suing the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) after they returned with thyroid cancer, Leukemia, and brain tumors as a result of being exposed to radiation at 300 times the safe level.
TEPCO has repeatedly been caught lying in their efforts to downplay the scale of the disaster. In September it was confirmed that radiation readings around the power plant were 18 times higher than previously reported by TEPCO. After a tank leaked 300 tonnes of toxic water in August, groundwater radiation readings at the plant soared to 400,000 becquerels per litre, the highest reading since the nuclear accident occurred in March 2011.
Top scientists have warned that if another major earthquake hits Fukushima, which is almost inevitable, it would mean “bye bye Japan” and the complete evacuation of the west coast of North America.
Now that radioactive debris is hitting the West Coast of North America, numerous different animals and sea life are suffering from mysterious diseases, including 20 bald eagles that have died in Utah over the last few weeks alone.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/reggie-black-lab/	Reggie the Black Lab’s Adoption	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"REGGIE THE BLACK LAB Surprise ending.

 

They told me the big black Lab’s name was Reggie, as I looked at him lying in his pen. The shelter was clean, no-kill, and the people really friendly.
I’d only been in the area for six months, but everywhere I went in the small college town, people were welcoming and open. Everyone waves when you pass them on the street.
But something was still missing as I attempted to settle in to my new life here, and I thought a dog couldn’t hurt. Give me someone to talk to. And I had just seen Reggie’s advertisement on the local news. The shelter said they had received numerous calls right after, but they said the people who had come down to see him just didn’t look like “Lab people,” whatever that meant. They must’ve thought I did.


But at first, I thought the shelter had misjudged me in giving me Reggie and his things, which consisted of a dog pad, bag of toys almost all of which were brand new tennis balls, his dishes and a sealed letter from his previous owner.
See, Reggie and I didn’t really hit it off when we got home. We struggled for two weeks (which is how long the shelter told me to give him to adjust to his new home). Maybe it was the fact that I was trying to adjust, too. Maybe we were too much alike.
I saw the sealed envelope. I had completely forgotten about that. “Okay, Reggie,” I said out loud, “let’s see if your previous owner has any advice.”
To Whomever Gets My Dog:
Well, I can’t say that I’m happy you’re reading this, a letter I told the shelter could only be opened by Reggie’s new owner. I’m not even happy writing it. He knew something was different.
So let me tell you about my Lab in the hopes that it will help you bond with him and he with you. First, he loves tennis balls. The more the merrier.
Sometimes I think he’s part squirrel, the way he hoards them. He usually always has two in his mouth, and he tries to get a third in there. Hasn’t done it yet. Doesn’t matter where you throw them, he’ll bound after them, so be careful. Don’t do it by any roads.
Next, commands. Reggie knows the obvious ones —“sit,” “stay,” “come,” “heel.” He knows hand signals, too: He knows “ball” and “food” and “bone” and “treat” like nobody’s business. Feeding schedule: twice a day, regular store-bought stuff; the shelter has the brand. He’s up on his shots. Be forewarned: Reggie hates the vet. Good luck getting him in the car. I don’t know how he knows when it’s time to go to the vet, but he knows. Finally, give him some time. It’s only been Reggie and me for his whole life. He’s gone everywhere with me, so please include him on your daily car rides if you can. He sits well in the backseat, and he doesn’t bark or complain. He just loves to be around people, and me most especially.
And that’s why I need to share one more bit of info with you…His name’s not Reggie. He’s a smart dog, he’ll get used to it and will respond to it, of that I have no doubt. But I just couldn’t bear to give them his real name. But if someone is reading this …well it means that his new owner should know his real name.
His real name is “Tank.” Because, that is what I drive. I told the shelter that they couldn’t make “Reggie” available for adoption until they received word from my company commander. You see, my parents are gone, I have no siblings, no one I could’ve left Tank with … and it was my only real request of the Army upon my deployment to Iraq, that they make one phone call to the shelter …in the “event” … to tell them that Tank could be put up for adoption. Luckily, my CO is a dog-guy, too, and he knew where my platoon was headed. He said he’d do it personally. And if you’re reading this, then he made good on his word. Tank has been my family for the last six years, almost as long as the Army has been my family. And now I hope and pray that you make him part of your family, too, and that he will adjust and come to love you the same way he loved me.
If I have to give up Tank to keep those terrible people from coming to the US I am glad to have done so. He is my example of service and of love. I hope I honored him by my service to my country and comrades.
All right, that’s enough. I deploy this evening and have to drop this letter off at the shelter. Maybe I’ll peek in on him and see if he finally got that third tennis ball in his mouth. Good luck with Tank. Give him a good home, and give him an extra kiss goodnight – every night – from me.
Thank you,
Paul Mallory
_____________________
I folded the letter and slipped it back in the envelope. Sure, I had heard of Paul Mallory, everyone in town knew him, even new people like me. Local kid, killed in Iraq a few months ago and posthumously earning the Silver Star when he gave his life to save three buddies. Flags had been at half-mast all summer.
I leaned forward in my chair and rested my elbows on my knees, staring at the dog.
“Hey, Tank,” I said quietly. The dog’s head whipped up, his ears cocked and his eyes bright.
“C’mere boy.”
He was instantly on his feet, his nails clicking on the hardwood floor. He sat in front of me, his head tilted, searching for the name he hadn’t heard in months. “Tank,” I whispered. His tail swished.
I kept whispering his name, over and over, and each time, his ears lowered, his eyes softened, and his posture relaxed as a wave of contentment just seemed to flood him. I stroked his ears, rubbed his shoulders, buried my face into his scruff and hugged him.
“It’s me now, Tank, just you and me. Your old pal gave you to me.” Tank reached up and licked my cheek.
“So whatdaya say we play some ball?” His ears perked again.
“Yeah? Ball? You like that? Ball?”
Tank tore from my hands and disappeared into the next room. And when he came back, he had three tennis balls in his mouth.
If you can read this without getting a lump in your throat or a tear in your eye, you just ain’t right.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/pentagon-daycare-evac/	Marines Helped Evacuate Children From Pentagon Day Care on 9/11	Fiction!				2015/03/17	" Did you know this about 9-11? 
 
 
AFTER FLIGHT 77 HIT THE PENTAGON ON 9/11, THE FOLLOWING HAPPENED
A chaplain, who happened to be assigned to the Pentagon, told of an incident that happened right after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon on 9/11.
 
A daycare facility inside the Pentagon had many children, including infants who were in heavy cribs. The daycare supervisor, looking at all the children they needed to evacuate, was in a panic over what they could do.
 
There were many children, mostly toddlers, as well as the infants that would need to be taken out with the cribs. There was no time to try to bundle them into carriers and strollers.
 
Just then a young Marine came running into the center and asked what they needed. After hearing what the center director was trying to do, he ran back out into the hallway and disappeared. The director thought, “Well, here we are, on our own.”
 
About 2 minutes later, that Marine returned with 40 other Marines in tow. Each of them grabbed a crib with a child, and the rest started gathering up toddlers.
The director and her staff then helped them take all the children out of the center and down toward the park nears the Potomac ..
 
Once they got about 3/4 of a mile outside the building, the Marines stopped in the park, and then did a fabulous thing – they formed a circle with the cribs, which were quite sturdy and heavy, like the covered wagons in the Old West.
Inside this circle of cribs, they put the toddlers, to keep them from wandering off. Outside this circle were the 40 Marines, forming a perimeter around the children and waiting for instructions. There they remained until the parents could be notified and come get their children.
 
The chaplain then said, “I don’t think any of us saw nor heard of this on any of the news stories of the day. It was an incredible story of our men there.” There wasn’t a dry eye in the room.
 
The thought of those Marines and what they did and how fast they reacted; could we expect any less from them? It was one of the most touching stories from the Pentagon.
 
It’s the Military, not the politicians that ensure our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It’s the Military who salutes the flag, who serves beneath the flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag.
 
If you care to offer the smallest token of recognition and appreciation for the military, please pass this on and pray for our men and women, who have served and are currently serving our country, and pray for those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/babysamuel/	Picture of a Surgeon Holding Hands With a 21week Old Fetus	Truth!   & Disputed!   				2015/03/17	"This picture of a 21-week fetus hand reaching up through an incision in its mother’s uterus to grab the finger of the surgeon who had just performed a life-saving procedure appeared in the November 16 edition of The National Enquirer. 
It should be “The Picture of the Year,” or perhaps, “The Picture of the Decade.”
The 21-week-old unborn baby is named Samuel Alexander Armas, and is being operated on by a surgeon named Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not survive if removed from the mother’s womb.
Little Samuel’s mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of Dr. Bruner’s remarkable surgical procedure. Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs these special operations while the baby is still in the womb. In the procedure, a C-section removes the uterus and the doctor makes a small incision to operate on the baby.
During the surgery on little Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed, hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon’s finger. The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity.
The editors titled the picture, “Hand of Hope.”
The text explaining the picture begins, “The tiny hand of 21-week-old foetus Samuel Alexander Armas emerges from the mother’s uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life.”
That picture should be shown on every television newscast and run in every newspaper in America. It is a graphic reminder that growing in the womb of his or her mother is a baby. It is not a “glob of tissue,” or “product of conception.” That pre-born baby is a human being with all the emotions, will and personality of any human being. That picture says it in a way that a thousand words cannot.
Little Samuel’s mother said they “wept for days” when they saw the picture. She said, “The photo reminds us my pregnancy isn’t about disability or illness, it’s about a little person.” That’s what it’s always been about. That’s what the liberal elite have tried to get us to forget. May this image jog our memories so that we will never forget.

  Subject: Mother sentenced to death by stoning
  No, this is not a horror story from the Dark Ages — this is happening now. Please use the few moments it takes to read  this and perhaps sign and send the letter cited below.
  Certain acts are unconscionable. This is one of them. How could it possibly be just by any law of God or Man to stone a  woman to death for having a baby out of wedlock?
  YOU can make a difference. WE can make a difference. Please help. Thank you. Cora  ———-  On Oct. 4, 2002, the “Oprah” show devoted its entire hour to the story of Amina Lawal, a Nigerian woman who has been  sentenced to death by stoning because she had a baby out of wedlock. She has tried to appeal the decision but has been  unsuccessful, thus far. The head of Nigeria disagrees with these stonings but has so far done nothing-partly because of  the fear of not being re-elected.
  Amina Lawal’s stoning will occur as soon as she is finished nursing her child. She will be buried up to her neck in dirt  and townsmen will throw stones at her head until they kill her, which has been known to take hours.
  It should be noted that the father of the baby denied fathering the child and hence has escaped any punishment.
  I send out a plea to all women — and to all men who love and were raised by women — to help prevent this horrific and  inhumane event from occurring.
  It is this easy: Visit the Oprah website at Oprah.comhttp://www.oprah.com/   or http://www.oprah.com
  Click on the Amina Lawal pop up screen on the right side (or search using Amina’s name).
  You will see a pre-written letter addressed to the Nigerian Ambassador.
  Fill out your information at the bottom of the page and send it.
  Done. It’s that simple.
  You could go one step further and forward this e-mail to your friends so  they can be part of the mission to save Amina  Lawal.
  This is your chance to save one woman’s life. We can claim ignorance when doing nothing to stop vicious atrocities that  we know nothing about from occurring but there is no justification if we stand by and allow these events to take place  when we are fully aware of them.
  Now it is up to you. Thank you very much for reading this.

They have run out of space to park all of these brand new unsold cars and are having to buy acres and acres of land to store them.
NOTE:
The images on this webpage showing all of these unsold cars are just a very small portion of those around the world. There are literally thousands of these “car parks” rammed full of unsold cars in practically every country on the planet. Just in case you were wondering, these images have not been Photoshopped, they are the real deal!
Its hard to believe that there are so many unsold cars in the world but its true. The worse part is that the amount of unsold cars keeps on getting bigger every day.
It would be fair to say that it is becoming a mechanical epidemic of epic proportions. If anybody from outer space is reading this webpage, we here on Earth have too many cars, why not come and buy a few hundred thousand of them for your own planet! (sorry but this is all I can think of)
Below is shown just a few of the 57,000 cars (and growing) that await delivery from their home in the Port of Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.
The car industry would never sell these cars at massive reductions in their prices to get rid of them, no they still want every buck. If they were to price these cars for a couple of thousand they would sell them. However, nobody would then buy any expensive cars and then they would end up being unsold. Its quite a pickle we have gotten ourselves into.
Below is shown an image of the Nissan test track. Only it is no longer being used, reason…there are too many unsold cars parked up on it! The amount of cars keeps on piling up on it until its overflowing. Nissan then acquires more land to park up the cars, as they continue to come off the production line.
The car industry cannot stop making new cars because they would have to close their factories and lay off tens of thousands of employees. This would further add to the recession. Also the domino effect would be catastrophic as steel manufactures would not sell their steel. All the tens of thousands of places where car components are made would also be effected, indeed the world could come to a grinding halt.
Below is shown just a small area of a gigantic car park in Spain where tens of thousands of cars just sit and sunbathe all day.
Tens of thousands of cars are still being made every week but hardly any of them are being sold. Nearly every household in developed countries already has a car or even two or three cars parked up on their driveway as it is.
Below is an image of thousands upon thousands of unsold cars parked up on a runway near St Petersburg in Russia. They are all imported from Europe, they are all then parked up and they are all then left to rot. Consequently, the airport is now unusable for its original purpose.
The cycle of buying, using, buying using has been broken, it is now just a case of “using” with no buying. Below is an image of thousands of unsold cars parked up on an disused runway at Upper Heyford airbase near Bicester in Oxfordshire. They are seriously running out of space to store these cars.
It is a sorry state of affairs and there is no answer to it, solutions don’t exist. So the cars just keep on being manufactured and keep on adding to the millions of unsold cars already sitting redundant around the world.
As it is, there are more cars than there are people on the planet with an estimated 10 billion roadworthy cars in the world today. We literally cannot make enough of them. Below are seen just a few of the thousands of Citroen’s parked up at Corby in England. They are being added to daily, imported from France but with nowhere else to go once they arrive.
So there they sit, brand spanking new cars, all with a couple of miles on the clock that was consummate with them being driven to their car parks. Manufacturing more cars than can be sold is against all logic, logistics and economics but it continues day after day, week after week, month after month, year in year out.
Below, all nice and shiny but with nowhere to go. Red and white and black and silver, purple, pink and blue, all the colors of the rainbow and be they all brand new. Indeed all the colors of the rainbow are down there on those cars, making pretty mosaics, montages of color and still life. Maybe that is all they will now ever be, surreal urban art of the techno production age. Magnificent metal boxes, wasting space and saving grace, all sitting still, because its business at mill.
All around the world these cars just keep on piling up, there is no end in sight. The economy shouts out quite loud that nobody has the money anymore to spend on a new car. The reason being that they are making their “old” cars go on a lot longer. But we cannot stop making them, soon we will run out of space to park them. We are nearly running out of space to drive them that’s for sure!
Below the cars mount up in the port of Valencia in Spain. They will not be exported as there is nowhere for them to go, so they just sit and rot in their colorful droves.
Gone are the days when the family would have a new car every year, they are now keeping what they have got. It may be fair to say that some families still get a new car every year but its the majority that now do not. The results are in these images, hundreds of thousands if not millions of cars around the world are driven from their factories, parked up and left.
Could we say that these cars have been left to rot! Maybe, as these cars will certainly rot if they are not bought, driven and cared for. It does not look like they will be sold any day soon, many of them have been standing for over 12 months or even longer and this is detrimental to the car.
Below, as far as the eye can see, right into the background, cars, cars and more cars. But what’s beyond the horizon? Have a guess…Yes that’s right…even more cars! All brand new but with no homes to go to. Do you think they will ever start giving them away, that may be the only radical solution. Who knows, you could soon be getting a free car with every packet of cornflakes.
When a car is left standing idle, all the oil sinks to the bottom of the sump, and then corrosion begins to set in on all the internal engine parts where the oil has drained away. Cold corrosion is when condensation builds up in the cylinders and rust forms in the bores. The engines would then start to seize and would need to be professionally freed before they could be started. Also the tires start to lose air and the batteries start to go flat, indeed the detrimental list goes on and on.
So the longer they sit there the worse it slowly becomes for them. What is the answer to this? Well they need to be sold and that just isn’t happening.
The epidemic is not imporving, it is getting worse. Car manufactureres are constantly coming out with new models with the latest technology in them. Hence prospective buyers of, for example, a new Citroen Xsara Picasso want the latest model, not last years model. Hence all the unsold Citroen Xsara Picasso cars from the previous year will now have even lesser chance of being sold.
The problems then just keep on mounting up. In the end, the unsold cars that are say 2 years old will have no alternative but to be either crushed up, dismantled and/or their parts recycled.
Some car manufacturers moved their production over to China, General Motors and Cadillac are examples of this. They are then shipped over in containers and unloaded at ports. However they are now being told to put a big halt in their import into the U.S.A. as they just can’t sell them in the quantities they would desire. Consequently Chinese car parks are now filling up with brand new American cars. Well nobody in China can afford them on their meagre pittance wages, so there they will stay until our economy improves…which it might do in a few generations.

Military hiring Muslim Brotherhood chaplains – AGAIN
Written by Allen West
Here’s yet another example of “are we just that stupid?” When the truth lies right before you and you refuse to accept it, whose fault is that?
Case in point comes from this report by Ryan Mauro of The Clarion Project who asks, “How can the government use chaplains from a group that they know is extremist and involved in terror funding? U.S. Military Hiring Muslim Brotherhood Chaplains – Again?”
Yes ladies and gents, our US military is recruiting Muslim chaplains from an organization with known ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. And if you’re somehow unfamiliar with the Muslim Brotherhood, please read the 1991 Explanatory Memorandum of the General Strategic Goal of the Ilkwan (Brotherhood) written by Mohammad Akram. The document, uncovered in an FBI raid, details the Brotherhoods planned infiltration of the US – and doggone if they’re not achieving their objectives. You can get your copy here.
According to Mauro’s report The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), a U.S. Muslim Brotherhood entity, is proudly announcing that the U.S. military is again using their chaplains for active-duty service after a 15-year lull. ISNA has a well-documented extremist history. In 1991, the Muslim Brotherhood listed ISNA as one of its main fronts. Declassified FBI memos said ISNA is a component of the Muslim Brotherhood, who sees its “work in America as a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within.” In 2007, the U.S. government labeled ISNA a U.S. Muslim Brotherhood entity and an unindicted co-conspirator in a terrorism-financing trial involving the Holy Land Foundation funneling money to Hamas. The label was upheld in 2009 because of “ample” evidence linking ISNA to Hamas. Last year, ISNA’s Canadian affiliate lost its status as a charity because of its accounting discrepancies and links to Pakistani terrorists.
You may call this “Islamophobic” but I’m certainly not stupid enough to allow my enemy into my country — definitely not my military.
The two chaplains endorsed by ISNA are Sgt. Mustapha Rahouchen, who will be used by the U.S. Army, and Captain Rafael Lantiqua, who was chosen by the U.S. Air Force.
The Muslim chaplaincy services for the military and prisons were started by Abdurrahman Alamoudi, who was convicted in 2003 on terrorism-related charges. He later admitted he was a secret member of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood.
Former Army officer Nidal Hasan was knowingly proselytizing against our US military combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His actions were dismissed over the concerns of political correctness and multiculturalism. Hasan was transferred from Walter Reed Hospital to Ft. Hood Texas where he shouted “Allahu Akhbar” while gunning down American Soldiers in 2009 — an incident the Obama administration still refers to as “workplace violence.” Before that, in 2003 another Hasan Akbar of the 101st Airborne Division threw hand grenades into his commanding officer’s sleeping area, killing two and wounding 14 others.
Don’t forget that Anwar al-Awlaki, Nidal Hasan’s mentor, was solicited to lead prayers in our nation’s capital after 9-11. Are we just this stupid? Yes, and it appears we are in fact “stuck on stupid” to the detriment of our national security and our men and women in uniform. I think we should be calling the secretary of defense, as well as the other service secretaries and chiefs and ask simply, Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot?

NDU SECURITY AWARENESS – TRAVELLERS NOTICE
Below forwarded for your information and awareness when travelling abroad.
Check out this video clip.
The video clip confirms this is a real threat. The point about overseas  law enforcement officials’ sensitivity to cell phones should be a warning  to  you and make the point that such officials, especially customs officials  don’t play jokes. So obey their instructions courteously and promptly
Here is something you should be aware of in your travels.  These new covert guns were first discovered in October when Dutch police  stumbled on a cache during a drug raid in Amsterdam. In another recent  incident, a Croatian gun dealer was caught attempting to smuggle a  shipment  through Slovenia into Western Europe. Police say both shipments are  believed  to have originated in Yugoslavia. Interpol sent out a warning to law  enforcement agencies around the world. European border police and customs  officers are at a heightened state of alert at all ports, airports and  border crossings.
“Beneath the digital face lies a .22-caliber pistol a phone gun capable of  firing four rounds in quick succession with a touch of the otherwise  standard keypad. European law enforcement officials stunned by the  discovery of these deadly decoys say phone guns are changing the rules of  engagement in Europe. It means police will have to draw their weapons  whenever a person being checked reaches for their mobile phone. Although  cell phone guns have not hit America yet, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms, and the U.S. Customs Service say they’ve been  briefed  on the new weapons.  Realistic Appearance. “If you didn’t know they were guns, you wouldn’t  suspect anything,” said Ari Zandbergen, spokesman for the Amsterdam  police.  “Only when you have one in your hand do you realize that they are  heavier,”  says Birgit Heib of the German Federal Criminal Investigation Agency.  “The  guns are loaded by twisting the phone in half. The .22-caliber rounds fit  into the top of the phone under the screen. The lower half, under the  keyboard, holds the firing pins. The bullets fire through the antenna by  pressing numbers on the keypad. Amsterdam police says they are very  sophisticated machines constructed inside gutted cell phones which do not  light up or operate as real phones. These are very difficult to make. We  believe experts are involved. ”  The video clip shows the cell phone actually firing. Again, these phones  have not hit the US, but they are in use in overseas. Keep that in mind  if  you are going through customs and are asked to turn over your cell phone  to  be checked. Never joke with Customs Officials.

WANTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER (The actual AP headline)
Linda Burnett, 23, was visiting her in-laws, and while there went to a nearby supermarket to pick up some groceries. Several people noticed her sitting in her car with the windows rolled up and with her eyes closed, with both hands behind the back of her head.
One customer who had been at the store for a while became concerned and walked over to the car. He noticed that Linda’s eyes were now open, and she looked very strange. He asked her if she was okay, and Linda replied that she’d been shot in the back of the head, and had been holding her brains in for over an hour.
The man called the paramedics, who broke into the car because the doors were locked and Linda refused to remove her hands from her head. When they finally got in, they found that Linda had a wad of bread dough on the back of her head.
A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded from the heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad of dough hit her in the back of her head. When she reached back to find out what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She initially passed out, but quickly recovered and tried to hold her brains in for over an hour. And, yes, Linda is a blonde.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/berman/	The Saga of the Hotel Soap	Fiction!				2015/03/17	"The Saga of Hotel Soap
The following letters were taken from an actual incident between a London hotel and one of it’s guests. The Hotel submitted the letters to the London Sunday Times for their humor column.
Dear Maid,
Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial. Please remove the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another three in the shower soap dish. They are in my way.
Thank you,
S. Berman
Dear Room 635,
I am not your regular maid. She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from her day off. I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you requested. The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind. This leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions from the management is to leave 3 soaps daily. I hope this is satisfactory.
Kathy, Relief Maid
Dear Maid – I hope you are my regular maid.
Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the little bars of soap. When I got back to my room this evening I found you had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet. I am going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my own bath-size Dial so I won’t need those 6 little Camays which are on the shelf. They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc. Please remove them.
S. Berman
Dear Mr. Berman,
My day off was last Wed. so the relief maid left 3 hotel soaps which we are instructed by the management. I took the 6 soaps which were in your way on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your Dial was. I put the Dial in the medicine cabinet for your convenience. I didn’t remove the 3 complimentary soaps which are always placed inside the medicine cabinet for all new check-ins and which you did not object to when you checked in last Monday. Please let me know if I can of further assistance.
Your regular maid,
Dotty
Dear Mr. Berman,
The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this morning that you called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid service. I have assigned a new girl to your room. I hope you will accept my apologies for any past inconvenience. If you have any future complaints please contact me so I can give it my personal attention. Call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.Thank you.
Elaine Carmen
Housekeeper
Dear Miss Carmen,
It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for business at 7:45 AM and don’t get back before 5:30 or 6PM. That’s the reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night. You were already off duty. I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little bars of soap. The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a new check-in today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the bath-room shelf. In just 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little bars of soap. Why are you doing this to me?
S. Berman
Dear Mr. Berman,
Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your room and remove the extra soaps. If I can be of further assistance, please call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.Thank you,
Elaine Carmen,
Housekeeper
Dear Mr. Kensedder,
My bath-size Dial is missing. Every bar of soap was taken from my room including my own bath-size Dial. I came in late last night and had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.
S. Berman
Dear Mr. Berman,
I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem. I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a room. The situation will be rectified immediately. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.
Martin L. Kensedder
Assistant Manager
Dear Mrs. Carmen,
Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room? I came in last night and found 54 little bars of soap. I don’t want 54 little bars of Camay. I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial. Do you realize I have 54 bars of soap in here. All I want is my bath size Dial. Please give me back my bath-size Dial.
S. Berman
Dear Mr. Berman,
You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed. Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing so I personally returned them. The 24 Camays which had been taken and the 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily. I don’t know anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets. Obviously your maid, Kathy, did not know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24 Camays plus the 3 daily Camays. I don’t know where you got the idea this hotel issues bath-size Dial. I was able to locate some bath-size Ivory which I left in your room.
Elaine Carmen
Housekeeper
Dear Mrs. Carmen,
Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory. As of today I possess:
– On the shelf under medicine cabinet – 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.
– On the Kleenex dispenser – 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 3.
– On the bedroom dresser – 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet,
– 1 stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.
– Inside the medicine cabinet – 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.
– In the shower soap dish – 6 Camay, very moist.
– On the northeast corner of tub – 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.
– On the northwest corner of tub – 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.
Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are neatly piled and dusted. Also, please advise her that stacks of more than 4 have a tendency to tip. May I suggest that my bedroom window sill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries. One more item, I have purchased another bar of bath-sized Dial which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings.

Please pass this on to everyone on your email list:
According to an article by Dr. Beverly Clark, in the Journal of the United  Medical Association (JUMA), the mystery behind a recent spate of deaths  has been solved. If you haven’t already heard about it in the news, here is  what happened.
3 women in Chicago, turned up at hospitals over a 5 day  period, all with the same symptoms. Fever, chills, and vomiting, followed  by muscular collapse, paralysis, and finally, death.  There were no outward signs of trauma.  Autopsy results showed toxicity in the blood. These women did not know  each  other, and seemed to have nothing in common.
It was discovered, however,  that they had all visited the same restaurant (Big Chappies, at Blare  Airport), within days of their deaths. The health department descended on  the restaurant, shutting it down. The food, water, and air conditioning  were all inspected and tested, to no avail.  The big break came when a waitress at the restaurant was rushed to the  hospital with similar symptoms. She told doctors that she had been on  vacation, and had only went to the restaurant to pick up her check. She  did not eat or drink while she was there, but had used the restroom. That is  when one toxicologist, remembering an article he had read, drove out to  the restaurant, went into the restroom, and lifted the toilet seat.  Under the seat, out of normal view, was small spider. The spider was  captured and brought back to the lab, where it was determined to be the  South American Blush Spider (arachnius gluteus), so named because of its  reddened flesh color. This spider’s venom is extremely toxic, but can take  several days to take effect. They live in cold, dark, damp, climates, and  toilet rims provide just the right atmosphere. Several days later a lawyer  from Los Angeles showed up at a hospital emergency room. Before his death,  he told the doctor, that he had been away on business, had taken a flight  from New York, changing planes in Chicago, before returning home. He did  not visit Big Chappies while there. He did, as did all of the other victims,  have what was determined to be a puncture wound, on his right buttock.  Investigators discovered that the flight he was on had originated in South  America. The Civilian Aeronautics Board (CAB) ordered an immediate  inspection of the toilets of all flights from South America, and  discovered the Blush spider’s nests on 4 different planes!  It is now believed that these spiders can be anywhere in the country. So  please, before you use a public toilet, lift the seat to check for  spiders.  It can save your life! And please pass this on to everyone you care about.

This picture of the statue below was made by an Iraqi artist named Kalat, who for years was forced by Saddam Hussein to make the many hundreds of bronze busts of Saddam that dotted Baghdad.  This artist was so grateful that the Americans liberated his country, he melted 3 of the fallen Saddam heads and made a memorial statue dedicated to the American soldiers and their fallen comrades.  Kalat worked on this night and day for several months.
To the left of the kneeling soldier is a small Iraqi girl giving the soldier comfort as he mourns the loss of his comrade in arms.  It is currently on display outside the palace that is now home to the 4th Infantry division.  It will eventually be shipped and shown at the memorial museum in Fort Hood, Texas.

Here is a reenlistment ceremony from Baghdad on the 4th of July.  It seems to say that all of the young men and women in these photos think that what they are doing is important and they want to continue to be part of it. Somehow this did not make it onto network news broadcasts.
Attached are pictures of what is reputedly the ‘largest re-enlistment ceremony ever held in military history’.  The ceremony was held July 4, 2008 at Al Faw Palace, Baghdad, Iraq. General Petraeus officiated.  A pizzeria in Chicago donated 2000 pizzas that were made last weekend, shipped on Sunday, arrived in Baghdad Wednesday and were fed to the enlistees on the 4th.

“I called the cemetery caretaker and explained my feelings. I spoke with the authorities and got special permission to take my wife home with me. They thought it strange, but I was allowed to take her with me. I rather have her at home than seven feet under ground. Lucy had a great sense of humor and I’m sure she would appreciate being my coffee table.”
Jeff ordered a special glass casing that eliminates the decomposition of a dead body. “It cost me about $6,000.00, but it was worth it.” Some of his friends and relatives, filled with fear, stopped visiting Jeff.

First of all, has anybody noticed that just recently, the company has changed their name? Kentucky Fried Chicken has become KFC. Does anybody know why? We thought the real reason was because of the “FRIED” food issue. It’s not. The reason why they call it KFC is because they can not use the word chicken anymore. Why? KFC does not use real chickens. They actually use genetically manipulated organisms. These so called “chickens” are kept alive by tubes inserted into their bodies to pump blood and nutrients throughout their structure. They have no beaks, no feathers, and no feet. Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them.
This is great for KFC because they do not have to pay so much for their production costs. There is no more plucking of the feathers or the removal of the beaks and feet. The government has told them to change all of their menus so they do not say chicken anywhere. If you look closely you will notice this. Listen to their commercials, I guarantee you will not see or hear the word chicken. I find this matter to be very disturbing. I hope people will start to realize this and let other people know. Please forward this message to as many people as you can. Together we make KFC start using real chicken again.

This one was really close. Big post flight hose-down.
Check out the speed brakes fully deployed on the F-16 on the left!
These guys are better than this, but close calls do happen. Obviously  the timing was off in this maneuver. In a crossover, both planes try to
cross each other at the same altitude going different directions. The  lead plane flies a constant airspeed, and the second plane adjusts his
airspeed (relative motion) to stay as close possible without having a  mid-air.
In the photo, the second plane was going too fast and pulled his speed  brakes (panels sticking out on tail) and idled his engine (decreased
contrail).
He also was changing his altitude, based on the aeronautical law that  states that two planes cannot occupy the same airspace at the same time.  The altitude change was what saved his butt. I still can’t believe they  didn’t swap paint.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/soundbarrier/	A U.S. Navy Sailor Snapped a Picture of a Jet Fighter Breaking the Sound Barrier	Disputed!				2015/03/25	"Awesome – Wanna see a sonic boom?
Through the viewfinder of his camera, Ensign John Gay could see the fighter plane drop from the skyheading toward the port side of the aircraft carrier Constellation.
At 1,000 feet, the pilot drops the F/A-18C Hornet to increase his speed to 750 mph, vapor flickering off the curved surfaces of the plane. In the precise moment a cloud in the shape of a farm-fresh egg forms around the Hornet 200 yards from the carrier, its engines rippling the Pacific Ocean just 75 feet below, Gay hears an explosion and snaps his camera shutter once.
“I clicked the same time I heard the boom, and I knew I had it”, Gay said. What he had was a technically meticulous depiction of the sound barrier being broken July 7, 1999, somewhere on the Pacific between Hawaii and Japan.
Sports Illustrated, Brills Content and Life ran the photo. The photo recently took first prize in the science and technology division in the World Press Photo 2000 contest, which drew more than 42,000 entries worldwide.
“All of a sudden, in the last few days, I’ve been getting calls from everywhere about it again. It’s kind of neat,” he said, in a telephone interview from his station in Virginia Beach, Va.  A naval veteran of 12 years, Gay, 38, manages a crew of eight assigned to take intelligence photographs from the high-tech belly of an F-14 Tomcat, the fastest fighter in the U.S. Navy. In July, Gay had been part of a Joint Task Force Exercise as the Constellation made its way to Japan. Gay selected his Nikon 90 S, one of the five 35 mm cameras he owns. He set his 80-300 mm zoom lens on 300 mm, set his shutter speed at 1/1000 of a second with an aperture setting of F5.6. “I put it on full manual, focus and exposure,” Gay said. “I tell young photographers who are into automatic everything, you aren’t going to get that shot on auto. The plane is too fast. The camera can’t keep up.” At sea level a plane must exceed 741mph to break the sound barrier, or the speed at which sound travels. The change in pressure as the plane outruns all of the pressure and sound waves in front of it is heard on the ground as an explosion or sonic boom. The pressure change condenses the water in the air as the jet passes these waves. Altitude, wind speed, humidity, the shape and trajectory of the plane – all of these affect the breaking of this barrier. The slightest drag or atmospheric pull on the plane shatters the vapor oval like fireworks as the plane passes through, he said everything on July 7 was perfect. “You see this vapor flicker around the plane that gets bigger and bigger. You get this loud boom, and it’s instantaneous. The vapor cloud is there, and then it’s not there. It’s the coolest thing you have ever seen.”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/chocolate-train-05012013/	Train in Brussels is World’s Longest Chocolate Structure	Truth!				2015/03/25	"The Chocolate Train
A train made entirely of chocolate has set a new Guinness World Record as the longest chocolate structure in the world.
The sculpture, on display at the busy Brussels South station, is 112-feet (34.05 meters) long and weighs over 2,755 pounds (1250 kilos).
Maltese chocolate artist Andrew Farrugia spent over 700 hours constructing the masterpiece.
He said he came up with the idea of the train last year after visiting the Belgian Chocolate Festival in Bruge: “I had this idea for a while, and I said what do you think if we do this realization of a long chocolate train, you know, because a train you can make it as long as you like.
“Actually it was going to be much smaller than it was, but I kept on adding another wagon, and another wagon, and it’s the size it is today.”
Farrugia had previously built a smaller train of 12 feet for an event in Malta, which he said gave him insight about how to build this much larger version.
There are two parts to the train. The first seven wagons are modeled after the new Belgian trains, and the rest of the train is modeled after the old train wagons, including a wagon with a bar and restaurant on board.
Three days before the event, Farrugia transported the chocolate train by truck in 25 wooden boxes from Malta to Belgium .
Farrugia said the train incurred considerable damage during the drive and several of the train’s walls had completely collapsed. Luckily, with hard work and little sleep, the chocolate artist was able to fix all the damages before presenting the train to the public on Monday.
After measuring the length of the train and confirming no material other than chocolate was used, officials from the Guinness Book of World Records added a new category to the collection of world records and declared the train to be the longest chocolate structure in the world.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ussnewyork/	A New Navy Ship, the USS New York, is Partly Built With Steel From the Ruins of the World Trade Center	Truth!				2015/03/24	"With a year to go before it even touches the water,  the Navy’s amphibious assault ship USS New York has already made history. It was built with 24 tons of scrap steel from the World Trade Center.   USS New York is about 45 percent complete and should be ready for launch in mid-2007. Katrina disrupted construction when it pounded the Gulf Coast last summer, but the 684-foot vessel escaped serious damage, and workers were back at the yard near New Orleans two weeks after the storm.   It is the fifth in a new class of warship – designed for missions that include special operations against terrorists. It will carry a crew of 360 sailors and 700 combat-ready Marines to be delivered ashore by helicopters and assault craft.   “It would be fitting if the first mission this ship would go on is to make sure that bin Laden is taken out, his terrorist organization is taken out,” said Glenn Clement, a paint foreman. “He came in through the back door and knocked our towers down and (the New York) is coming right through the front door, and we want them to know that.”   Steel from the World Trade Center was melted down in a foundry in Amite, La., to cast the ship’s bow section. When it was poured into the molds on Sept. 9, 2003, “those big rough steelworkers treated it with total reverence,” recalled Navy Capt. Kevin Wensing, who was there. “It was a spiritual moment for everybody there.”   Junior Chavers, foundry operations manager, said that when the trade center steel first arrived, he touched it with his hand and the “hair on my neck stood up.” “It had a big meaning to it for all of us,” he said.   “They knocked us down. They can’t keep us down.  We’re going to be back.”   The ship’s motto? – ‘Never Forget’

https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-corps-hitler-youth/	FEMA Corps Team Members Are the Modern Day Hitler Youth	Fiction!				2015/03/23	"Scary! FEMA Corps graduates first class. Might you wonder why?

Is this the Civilian Defence Force that Obama promised when he was elected ?
As large as our military ?
Full time and paid ?
Whiteout Press
Homeland Security graduates first Corps of Homeland Youth
October 7, 2012. Vicksburg. The federal government calls them FEMA Corps. But they conjure up memories of the Hitler Youth of 1930’s Germany. Regardless of their name, the Dept of Homeland Security has just graduated its first class of 231 Homeland Youth. Kids, aged 18-24 and recruited from the President’s AmeriCorp volunteers, they represent the first wave of DHS’s youth corps, designed specifically to create a full time, paid, standing army of FEMA Youth across the country.
On September 13, 2012, the Dept of Homeland Security graduated its first class of FEMA Corps youth, aka the Homeland Youth. Image courtesy of DHS.gov.
On September 13, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security graduated its first class of FEMA Corps first-responders. While the idea of having a volunteer force of tens of thousands of volunteers scattered across the country to aid in times of natural disasters sounds great, the details and timing of this new government army is somewhat curious, if not disturbing.

DHS raising an armed army
The first problem one finds with this ‘new army’ is the fact that they are mere children. Yes, 18 is generally the legal age a person can sign a contract, join the military or be tried as an adult. But ask any parent – an 18, 20 or even a 24 year-old is still a naïve, readily-influenced kid.
The second problem with this announcement and program is its timing. Over the past two years, President Obama has signed a number of Executive Orders suspending all civil and Constitutional rights and turning over management of an America under Martial Law to FEMA. Also in that time, domestic federal agencies under DHS, including FEMA, have ordered billions of rounds of ammunition as well as the corresponding firearms. Admittedly, these new weapons and ammunition aren’t to be used in some far-off war or to fight forest fires in California, but right here on the streets of America.
Strange Armoured Fighting Vehicles
Individuals around the US have begun reporting the site of strange, new, heavily-armed FEMA fighting vehicles. What would a disaster relief agency like FEMA need with 2,500 brand new GLS armoured fighting vehicles? According to the agency’s own mandate, as well as President Obama’s recent Executive Order, the answer is ‘population control’ during a time of Martial Law.
One set of images made available by Rense.com shows trailer after trailer carrying these new DHS and FEMA armoured fighting vehicles, complete with machine gun slots. They’re labelled with the usual backward American flag and the title, ‘Homeland Security’. Below that and the DHS logo, it also reads, ‘Immigration & Customs Enforcement’. Joining those markings, the black vehicles with white lettering also display ‘POLICE/RESCUE’ on one side and ‘Special Response Team’ on the other.
DHS & FEMA armed fighting vehicles. Images courtesy of Rense.com.
FEMA Corps
FEMA Deputy Administrator Rich Serino gave the keynote address at the ‘Induction Ceremony’ for the inaugural class of FEMA Corps members. According to the DHS website, ‘Corps members assist with disaster preparedness, response, and recovery activities, providing support in areas ranging from working directly with disaster survivors to supporting disaster recovering centres to sharing valuable disaster preparedness and mitigation information with the public.’
Serino describes what the first FEMA Corps class has accomplished so far, as well as where they’ll be going next:
‘Yesterday, we welcomed 231 energetic members into the first ever FEMA Corps class. The members just finished off their first month of training with our partners at the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and are one step closer to working in the field on disaster response and recovery. They will now head to FEMA’s Centre for Domestic Preparedness to spend the next two weeks training in their FEMA position-specific roles. Once they complete both the CNCS and FEMA training, these 231 dedicated FEMA Corps members will be qualified to work in one of a variety of disaster related roles, ranging from Community Relations to Disaster Recovery Centre support.’

Unlike most local disaster response teams who are volunteers, training periodically and only showing up when there’s a disaster, the FEMA Corps will be a paid, full time, standing army of government youth. FEMA Deputy Administrator Sarino goes on to explain, ‘The new members, who range in age from 18-24 years old, will contribute to a dedicated, trained, and reliable disaster workforce by working full-time for ten months on federal disaster response and recovery efforts.’
In closing his announcement of the first graduating class of FEMA Corps Youth, Sarino describes his and the agency’s vision of the future, one where ‘FEMA Corps sets the foundation for a new generation of emergency managers’.
As we detailed in the August 28 Whiteout Press article ‘History of DHS Ammunition Purchases’, federal emergency management agencies are looking more and more like a military army every day.
The federal government’s procurement website actually lists DHS’ requests for bids to supply it with ammunition and military weaponry. All of the orders listed in the above article, including the orders for hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition, are publicly available at http://www.fbo.gov/.
One look at a chart of DHS ammunition purchases over the past decade reveals a drastic spike in orders of bullets recently, totalling in the billions of rounds. Other charts available online show a similar drastic spike in the purchases of accompanying weaponry by the Department of Homeland Security.
What is the US federal government preparing for? And why does it feel it needs an army of brainwashed youth, millions of guns, thousands of armoured fighting vehicles and literally billions of rounds of ammunition, just to provide relief to the American people during a natural disaster? Any historian will tell you it sounds more like the arming of the Hitler Youth than an army of first responders fighting forest fires and hurricanes.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/ligers/	Ligers, a Cross Between a Lion and a Tiger	Truth!				2015/03/21	"AMAZING ANIMAL….!! The 10ft Liger who’s still growing…
He looks like something from a prehistoric age or a fantastic creation from Hollywood. But Hercules is very much living flesh and blood – as he proves every time he opens his gigantic mouth to roar. Part lion, part tiger, he is not just a big cat but a huge one,standing 10ft tall on his back legs. Called a liger, in reference to his crossbreed parentage, he is the largest of all the cat species.
On a typical day he will devour 20lb of meat, usually beef or chicken, and is capable of eating 100lb at a single setting. At just three years old, Hercules already weighs half a ton.

He is the accidental result of two enormous big cats living close together at the Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species, in Miami, Florida, and already dwarfs both his parents.
“Ligers are not something we planned on having,” said institute owner Dr Bhagavan Antle. “We have lions and tigers living together in large enclosures and at first we had no idea how well one of the lion boys was getting along with a tiger girl, then lo and behold we had a liger.”

50mph runner… Not only that, but he likes to swim, a feat unheard of among water-fearing lions. In the wild it is virtually impossible for lions and tigers to mate. Not only are they enemies likely to kill one another, but most lions are in Africa and most tigers in Asia. But incredible though he is, Hercules is not unique. Ligers have been bred in captivity, deliberately and accidentally, since shortly before World War II.

Today there are believed to be a handful of ligers around the world and a similar number of tigons, the product of a tiger father and lion mother. Tigons are smaller than ligers and take on more physical characteristics of the tiger.
Famous cross-breeds

https://www.truthorfiction.com/mcdonalds-worm-burgers/	McDonald’s Uses Worm Meat Fillers	Fiction!				2015/03/29	" McDonald’s Uses Worm Meat Fillers But Can Legally Call It 100% Beef
 
   
McDonald’s Uses Worm Meat Fillers But Can Legally Call It 100% Beef. Large companies have been the subject of rumors that they substitute unusual or unethical substances in their products, usually to decrease costs. McDonald’s is not immune to such claims. McDonald’s has been accused of using everything from worms to cow eyeballs in its burgers. Dating far back to at least 1978, there have been rumors that McDonald’s restaurants use earthworms in their hamburgers.
The fact that McDonald’s uses cow eyeballs and worm fillers does not stop them from legally using the claim that they served 100% beef. McDonald’s has assured its consumers that its product contains 100% beef. They are allowed to do this because McDonald’s buys their “beef” from a company called “100% Beef Company”, making it possible for McDonald’s to call beef byproducts and soy products “100% beef”.
McDonald’s then ships the beef to their grinding facility in Oak Brook, Illinois where they then take the ground worm filler and add it to their “100% beef patties”. McDonald’s serves billions of people around the world every year. This allows them to produce a higher profit margin by increasing the amount of patties that can be made, by increasing their product load with the worm filler. The worm filler is ground and packaged in a facility next to McDonald’s corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois. The employees must sign a confidentiality waiver to never discuss the ingredients of the McDonald’s food products or face termination and legal repercussions. However many employees have stepped up over the years with the truth and have created a huge controversy over the quality of food that the company produces..
McDonald’s has also been accused of using mutant laboratory meat, and pig fat their milkshakes and ice cream. Considering that one quarter of Americans eat McDonald’s every single day, although nutritionists recommend you do so only once a month, they are doing so unaware of the products they are putting into their body. If everybody truly knew what they were consuming, they definitely would not be eating this.

December 5, 2013 · by Diversity Chronicle · in Christians, Homophobia, Immigration, Intolerance, Islamophobia, The War On Women
Francis
For the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.
The Third Vatican Council concluded today with Pope Francis announcing that Catholicism is now a “modern and reasonable religion, which has undergone evolutionary changes. The time has come to abandon all intolerance. We must recognize that religious truth evolves and changes. Truth is not absolute or set in stone. Even atheists acknowledge the divine. Through acts of love and charity the atheist acknowledges God as well, and redeems his own soul, becoming an active participant in the redemption of humanity.”
“Through humility, soul searching, and prayerful contemplation we have gained a new understanding of certain dogmas. The church no longer believes in a literal hell where people suffer. This doctrine is incompatible with the infinite love of God. God is not a judge but a friend and a lover of humanity. God seeks not to condemn but only to embrace. Like the fable of Adam and Eve, we see hell as a literary device. Hell is merely a metaphor for the isolated soul, which like all souls ultimately will be united in love with God” Pope Francis declared.
In a speech that shocked many, the Pope claimed “All religions are true, because they are true in the hearts of all those who believe in them. What other kind of truth is there? In the past, the church has been harsh on those it deemed morally wrong or sinful. Today, we no longer judge. Like a loving father, we never condemn our children. Our church is big enough for heterosexuals and homosexuals, for the pro-life and the pro-choice! For conservatives and liberals, even communists are welcome and have joined us. We all love and worship the same God.”
One statement in the Pope’s speech has sent traditionalists into a fit of confusion and hysteria. “God is changing and evolving as we are, For God lives in us and in our hearts. When we spread love and kindness in the world, we touch our own divinity and recognize it. The Bible is a beautiful holy book, but like all great and ancient works, some passages are outdated. Some even call for intolerance or judgement. The time has come to see these verses as later interpolations, contrary to the message of love and truth, which otherwise radiates through scripture. In accordance with our new understanding, we will begin to ordain women as cardinals, bishops and priests. In the future, it is my hope that we will have a woman pope one day. Let no door be closed to women that is open to men!”
In addition to the Pope’s sweeping calls for tolerance and a new progressive understanding of Catholicism, he condemned racism, raising his voice and pounding the podium in front of him. Pope Francis spent over an hour castigating anti-immigrant politicians, parties and individuals. Wagging his finger sternly with righteous indignation, the Pope shouted “Racism today is the ultimate evil in the world. When Italians, Spanish or French turn back the boats of African migrants seeking a better life, are they not like the inn keeper who told Mary and Joseph that there was no room for them and the infant Christ? These migrants are children of God and we are commanded to love them!”
His voice loudly echoing through St. Peter’s basilica, the Pope stated “those who would dare to turn immigrants away, be they legal or undocumented, turn their backs on Christ himself! A racist is not a true Christian. A racist casts aside his humanity to become a beast, a demon! He is the embodiment and personification of evil, a Satan!”
To a chorus of thunderous applause, Pope Francis stated “because Muslims, Hindus and African Animists are also made in the very likeness and image of God, to hate them is to hate God! To reject them to is to reject God and the Gospel of Christ. Whether we worship at a church, a synagogue, a mosque or a mandir, it does not matter. Whether we call God, Jesus, Adonai, Allah or Krishna, we all worship the same God of love. This truth is self-evident to all who have love and humility in their hearts!”
In a announcement that shocked many people, Pope Francis warned that “those who seek to deny a home to the migrant, to the African and the Muslim, risk their membership in the church. We will consider excommunication for those whose souls willingly dwell in the darkness and evil of intolerance and racism. Satan himself is a metaphor or a personification, for the collective evils of mankind. Today, these evils manifest foremost as racism, intolerance, religious persecution and bigotries of all kinds.”
A couple of prominent Catholic cardinals have responded to Pope Francis’ declarations by leaving the church. Cardinal Arinze of Nigeria asked, “what do we stand for if we declare that truth is relative? On the contrary, truth exists independently of our personal feelings. All of this talk of love and tolerance is hollow if we have no identity of our own, if we stand for nothing. I charge that Francis has become a heretic, and that he is not a valid Pope. Indeed, Francis is no longer even a Catholic. The seat of Saint Peter is vacant. I am now a Sedevacantist. I should have become one long ago. The Vatican has embraced ecumenism in the past, but worse than that, it has now embraced moral relativism on abortion and homosexuality. At the same time it is embracing moral absolutism in favour of illegal immigration and cultural genocide against Europe.”
In his most controversial statement, Cardinal Arinze said “Islam has overrun my own country, and now it threatens to overrun Europe. Some parts of Nigeria now live under Islamic Sharia law. Catholics there are no longer free to practice their faith publicly. Francis is a fool if he thinks that his liberal immigration policy will end well. He has betrayed western civilization. Vatican City will one day become a giant mosque if things continue in Europe along their present course. Those in the West who ignore this truth, do so at their own peril.”
In an angry and vitriolic rant revealing deep self-hating tendencies, the African Cardinal Arinze stated “There is nothing wrong with Europeans who want to protect their borders. The problem is that there is not enough border control and the immigration policies are far too lenient in Europe. Is it racist to desire to preserve one’s own home? Why is it racist to want to preserve your own culture and a future for your people and your children? Have white people gone stupid today?”
This much is clear, the Catholic Church has made a decision to rejoin humanity and to reject intolerance and extremism. The church has lost a few narrow-minded bigots, with reports of some small parishes and a few cardinals and bishops defecting, but Pope Francis has gained the friendship of the world. Pope Francis deserves praise for taking a humane stand in defence of human rights and against bigotry.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/kittenger-free-fall/	Man Jumped From an Altitude of 102,800 Feet Back to Earth	Truth!				2015/03/28	" 
Jump from 20 miles up

Joe Kittinger is not a household aviation name like Neil Armstrong or Chuck Yeager. But what he did for the U. S. space program is comparable. On Aug. 16, 1960, as research for the then-fledgling U. S. space program, Air Force Captain Joseph Kittinger rode a helium balloon to the edge of space, 102,800 feet above the earth, a feat in itself.
Then, wearing just a thin pressure suit and breathing supplemental oxygen, he leaned over the cramped confines of his gondola and jumped–into the 110-degree-below-zero, near-vacuum of space. Within seconds his body accelerated to 714mph in the thin air, breaking the sound barrier.

After free-falling for more than four and a half minutes, slowed finally by friction from the heavier air below, he felt his parachute open at 14,000 feet, and he coasted gently down to the New Mexico desert floor. Kittinger’s feat showed scientists that astronauts could survive the harshness of space with just a pressure suit and that man could eject from aircraft at extreme altitudes and survive.
Upon Kittinger’s return to base, a congratulatory telegram was waiting from the Mercury seven astronauts–including Alan Shepard and John Glenn. More than four decades later Kittinger’s two world records–the highest parachute jump, and the only man to break the sound barrier without an aircraft and live–still stand. We decided to visit the retired colonel and Aviation Hall of Famer, now 75, at his home in Altamonte Springs, Florida, to recall his historic jump.
FORBES GLOBAL: Take us back to New Mexico and Aug. 16, 1960.
Joe Kittinger: We got up at 2 a. m. to start filling the helium balloon. At sea level, it was 35 to 40 feet wide and 200 feet high; at altitude, due to the low air pressure, it expanded to 25 stories in width, and still was 20 stories high!
At 4 a. m. I began breathing pure oxygen for two hours. That’s how long it takes to remove all the nitrogen from your blood so you don’t get the bends going so high so fast. Then it was a lengthy dress procedure layering warm clothing under my pressure suit. They kept me in air-conditioning until it was time to launch because we were in the desert and I wasn’t supposed to sweat. If I did, my clothes would freeze on the way up.
How was your ascent?
It took an hour and a half to get to altitude. It was cold. At 40,000 feet, the glove on my right hand hadn’t inflated. I knew that if I radioed my doctor, he would abort the flight. If that happened, I knew I might never get another chance because there were lots of people who didn’t want this test to happen.
I took a calculated risk, that I might lose use of my right hand. It quickly swelled up, and I did lose use for the duration of the flight. But the rest of the pressure suit worked. When I reached 102,800 feet, maximum altitude, I wasn’t quite over the target.
So I drifted for 11 minutes. The winds were out of the east. What’s it look like from so high up? You can see about 400 miles in every direction. The formula is 1.25 x the sq. root of the altitude in thousands of feet. (The square root of 102,000 ft is 319 X 1.25 = 399 miles)     The most fascinating thing is that it’s just black overhead–the transition from normal blue to black is very stark. You can’t see stars because there’s a lot of glare from the sun, so your pupils are too small. I was struck with the beauty of it. But I was also struck by how hostile it is: more than 100 degrees below zero, no air. If my protection suit failed, I would be dead in a few seconds. Blood actually boils above 62, 000 feet.

I went through my 46-step checklist, disconnected from the balloonšs power supply and lost all communication with the ground. I was totally under power from the kit on my back. When everything was done, I stood up, turned around to the door, took one final look out and said a silent prayer: “Lord, take care of me now.” Then I just jumped over the side.
What were you thinking as you took that step?
It’s the beginning of a test. I had gone through simulations many times–more than 100. I rolled over and looked up, and there was the balloon just roaring into space. I realized that the balloon wasn’t roaring into space; I was going down at a fantastic rate! At about 90,000 feet, I reached 714mph.
The altimeter on my wrist was unwinding very rapidly. But there was no sense of speed. Where you determine speed is visual–if you see something go flashing by. But nothing flashes by 20 miles up–there are no signposts there, and you are way above any clouds. When the chute opened, the rest of the jump was anticlimactic because everything had worked perfectly. I landed 12 or 13 minutes later, and there was my crew waiting. We were elated.
How about your right hand?
It hurt–there was quite a bit of swelling and the blood pressure in my arm was high. But that went away in a few days, and I regained full use of my hand. What about attempts to break your record? We did it for air crews and astronauts–for the learning, not to set a record.
They will be going up as skydivers. Somebody will beat it someday. Records are made to be broken. And I’ll be elated. But I’ll also be concerned that they’re properly trained. If they’re not, they’re taking a heck of a risk.

On September 11, this week, a grocery called FRY’s had this big flag up in their parking lot in honor of the fireman and others here and as the sun was going down, look at what appeared in the shadow of the stars…. it seems, dear friends, that we are truly, “one nation under God,” whether they want to believe it or not!”

https://www.truthorfiction.com/dollarbill/	The Meanings of the Symbols On the One Dollar Bill	Truth!				2015/03/28	"Take out a dollar bill and look at it.
The one dollar bill you’re looking at first came off the presses in 1957 in its present design.
This so-called paper money is in fact a cotton and linen blend, with red and blue minute silk fibers running through it. It is actually material. We’ve all washed it without it falling apart. A special blend of ink is used, the contents we will never know. It is overprinted with symbols and then it is starched to make it water resistant and pressed to give it that nice crisp look.
If you look on the front of the bill, you will see the United States Treasury Seal. On the top you will see the scales for the balance-a balanced budget. In the center you have a carpenter’s T-square, a tool used for an even cut. Underneath is the Key to the United States Treasury. That’s all pretty easy to figure out, but what is on the back of that dollar bill is something we should all know.
If you turn the bill over, you will see two circles. Both circles, together, comprise the Great Seal of the United States. The First Continental Congress requested that Benjamin Franklin and a group of men come up with a Seal. It took them four years to accomplish this task and another two years to get it approved. If you look at the left hand circle, you will see a Pyramid. Notice the face is lighted and the western side is dark. This country was just beginning. We had not begun to explore the West or decided what we could do for Western Civilization.
The Pyramid is UN-capped, again signifying that we were not even close to being finished. Inside the capstone you have the all-seeing eye, and ancient symbol for divinity. It was Franklin’s belief that one man couldn’t do it alone, but a group of men, with the help of God, could do anything.
“IN GOD WE TRUST” is on this currency. The Latin above the pyramid, ANNUIT COEPTIS, means “God has favored our undertaking.” The Latin below the pyramid, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, means “a new order has begun.” At the base of the pyramid is the Roman Numeral for 1776. If you look at the right-hand circle, and check it carefully, you will learn that it is on every National Cemetery in the United States. It is also on the Parade of Flags Walkway at the Bushnell, Florida National Cemetery and is the centerpiece of most hero’s monuments. Slightly modified, it is the seal of the President of the United States and it is always visible whenever he speaks, yet no one knows what the symbols mean. The Bald Eagle was selected as a symbol for victory for two reasons: first, he is not afraid of a storm; he is strong and he is smart enough to soar above it. Secondly, he wears no material crown. We had just broken from the King of England. Also, notice the shield is unsupported. This country can now stand on its own. At the top of that shield you have a white bar signifying congress, a unifying factor. We were coming together as one nation. In the Eagle’s beak you will read, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, meaning “one nation from many people.”
Above the Eagle you have thirteen stars representing the thirteen original colonies, and any clouds of misunderstanding rolling away. Again, we were coming together as one. Notice what the Eagle holds in his talons. He holds an olive branch and arrows. This country wants peace, but we will never be afraid to fight to preserve peace. The Eagle always wants to face the olive branch, but in time of war, his gaze turns toward the arrows.
They say that the number 13 is an unlucky number. This is almost a worldwide belief. You will usually never see a room numbered 13, or any hotels or motels with a 13th floor But, think about this: 13 original colonies, 13 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 13 stripes on our flag, 13 steps on the Pyramid, 13 letters in the Latin above, 13 letters in “E Pluribus Unum”, 13 stars above the Eagle, 13 plumes of feathers on each span of the Eagle’s wing, 13 bars on that shield, 13 leaves on the olive branch, 13 fruits, and if you look closely, 13 arrows. And for minorities: the 13th Amendment. I always ask people, “Why don’t you know this?” Your children don’t know this and their history teachers don’t know this. Too may veterans have given up too much to ever let the meaning fade. Many veterans remember coming home to an America that didn’t care. Too many veterans never came home at all. Tell everyone what is on the back of the one dollar bill and what it stands for, because nobody else will.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/willie-myrick/	Boy Sang Gospel Song Until Kidnapper Released Him	Truth!				2015/03/31	" Boy Sings Gospel Song Until Kidnapper Releases Him



A young boy may have saved his own life by singing gospel music until his kidnapper let him go.
Earlier this month, then nine-year-old Willie Myrick was kidnapped from his southwest Atlanta driveway by an unknown man. Police say the kidnapper allegedly drove the boy around for hours before dropping him off unharmed in East Point.
During the frightening three hours, Willie says he continued to sing the gospel song “Every Praise” by Hezekiah Walker until the kidnapper grew tired of cursing and telling him to shut up. Eventually the man kicked him out.
“He opened the door and threw me out. He told me not to tell anyone,” Willie recounted in front of a crowded sanctuary at Mt. Carmel Baptist Church.
News of the gospel singing boy quickly spread making its way to the ears of Hezekiah Walker. Inspired by the amazing story, the Grammy-Award winning gospel singer decided to fly from New York to Atlanta to meet Willie.
“It’s just emotional to me because you never know who you’re going to touch,” Walker told 11 Alive’s Blayne Alexander.”I just wanted to hug him and tell him I love him.”
Walker arrived at Mt. Carmel Baptist Church on Thursday evening and did just that. He grabbed Willie and gave him a gripping hug as tears ran down the boy’s face. After the emotional moment, Walker led Willie and the rest of the church in singing the song that led to the inspirational story, “Every Praise.”
Currently, Willie’s adbuctor is still at large. Police have release a sketch and are requesting that anyone who knows the man or has any information call CrimeStoppers at 404-577-TIPS.

I went to the VA Hospital in Iron Mountain today on business. While there I stopped at the Chapel and found pinky-purple curtains with mesh at the top, covering the altar. (You know the type. They use them between sick patients in the hospital). I stopped in my tracks, shocked at what I saw. I peeked behind the curtain, and found what used to be the welcoming part of the chapel, the Cross, a picture of Jesus, and other Christian icons familiar to the majority of Americans. I found Chaplain Bob Mueller, to ask what the meaning was of this change. This is what he told me. “A couple of months ago, an order came down from Washington DC to cover all things associated with Christianity in the VA. Their solution is to cover everything in all the VA Chapels across the country.” Chaplain Bob went on to say, “A few weeks ago an official from the Madison VA came down here to tell me to ‘stop talking about Jesus, and to stop reading Scripture out loud.’” Chaplain Bob also said that the rest of the Obama plan is to send more curtains to cover the rest of the stained glass windows, because there are Christian symbols on the stained glass. These photos reveal future plans by the White House. To use the same phrase President Obama so ‘eloquently’ used concerning other matters at the VA, ‘I’m mad as hell…” As Americans, we need to stand together to stop this insanity.

https://www.truthorfiction.com/costco-halal-meat/	Halal Meat at Costco	Unproven!				2015/03/30	"
Costco Now Has This Halal marked meats…
THIS IS COMING AND LOOK OUT FOR THIS INTRUSION IN U.S. and CANADIAN MARKETS… Halalmeat… are you aware of this? Take a look and forward to your friends and family. Do Not buy this meat!
“Costco stocking their meat counters with “Halal” meat.”
I shopped for groceries at my local Wal-Mart. As usual, I bought a bag of frozen chicken breasts, but this time I checked to make sure the meat was not labeled “Halal.” Here’s why:
Halal is the Islamic term that basically means the meat is lawful to eat for a devout Muslim. What makes it lawful or acceptable is that the meat has been processed in a very specific way. Unlike kosher food, where the physical processing of the meat is the focus, for Islam it is the spiritual component that makes the meat lawful.
For lawful (halal) meat in Islam, the animal must be killed while the butcher faces Mecca , and either the butcher cries “Allah Akbar” or a tape plays the words over a loud speaker.
Ann Barnhardt is a cattle commodities broker, has more about “Halal.”
NEVER buy meat that is marked as “Halal.”
I am in the cattle business, and believe me when I tell you that Halal kill plants are CONSTANTLY being cited and shut down by the USDA for horrific infractions. Most of these plants are in Michigan and upstate New York ..
One of the things that halal kill plants are notorious for is putting already-dead animals in the human consumption line. They will go pick up a dead cow off of a farm or ranch and instead of putting it in their rendering tank where the resulting “tankage” is worth pennies on the dollar as pet food or industrial products, they will shackle the dead animal on the normal kill line and process it as human food which is the highest-dollar product.
Since Islam teaches dishonesty (taqiyyah) and no regard for one’s neighbor, this kind of sickening behavior is standard.
Halal plants are also notorious for general citations for filth and uncleanliness. I have toured normal cattle slaughter plants, and guys, you could eat off of the floor. Everything is white and men walk around with water hoses and steam guns constantly keeping everything in a state of spotlessness.
Halal plants are filthy. A lot of Halal meat is also labeled as “organic.”
Again, don’t be fooled into thinking that “halal” means “better.” It isn’t. I would never, ever knowingly eat halal meat purely from a food safety perspective.

His father abandoned the family when the child was an infant, His mother became a prostitute and the boy and his sister had to live with their grandmother. Early in life he proved to be gifted for music and with three other kids he sang in the streets of New Orleans. His first gains were the coins that were thrown to them.
A Jewish family, Karnofsky, who had immigrated from Lithuania to the USA had pity for the 7-year-old boy and brought him into their home. Initially given ‘work’ in the house, to feed this hungry child. There he remained and slept in this Jewish families home where, for the first time in his life he was treated with kindness and tenderness.
When he went to bed, Mrs. Karnovsky sang him a Russian Lullaby that he would sing with her.
Later, he learned to sing and play several Russian and Jewish songs. Over time, this boy became the adopted son of this family. The Karnofskys gave him money to buy his first musical instrument; as was the custom in the Jewish families. They sincerely admired his musical talent. Later, when he became a professional musician and composer, he used these Jewish melodies in compositions, such as St. James Infirmary and Go Down Moses.
The little black boy grew up and wrote a book about this Jewish family who had adopted him in 1907. In memory of this family and until the end of his life, he wore a star of David and said that in this family he had learned “how to live real life and determination.”
You might recognize his name.
This little boy was called Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong.
Louis Armstrong proudly spoke fluent Yiddish.
