EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Chuck, for that warm introduction, and for your outstanding leadership as National President of the Fraternal Order of Police. I also want to commend the entire Fraternal Order of Police and all its leaders, including Jim Pasco, for the work you do on behalf of America’s peace officers. Let me also recognize FOP Auxiliary President Beverly Crump, members of the FOP Auxiliary, and members of Congress and my administration, including Attorney General Eric Holder, and distinguished guests who are here today.To the survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, our hearts go out to you for your loss. The husbands and wives, mothers and fathers you loved, they protected us all. And all Americans are grateful for the lives that they gave in the line of duty.To the active duty law enforcement officers who traveled from all over the country to be here, let me simply say, thank you. Thank you for the service you are rendering to our nation. And thank you for the sacrifices you are making on behalf of our people.Every day in America, families go about their lives. They wake up, sit down for breakfast, send their kids off to school. Then they head into the office, or onto the factory floor. And after putting in a honest day’s work, they return home, ready to do it all over again in the morning.We often take it for granted, this cycle of life. We know, of course, that chance can change everything overnight. But we also rely on a certain order in our lives, a certain sense of security that lets us sleep safely in our beds and walk around our neighborhoods free from fear, and go about our daily lives without being the victims of crime.That sense of security doesn’t come on its own. What makes it possible -- what makes freedom possible -- are the law enforcement officers that we honor today. It’s men and women like so many of you. It’s anyone who’s ever put on a uniform or worn a badge in the name of law, in the name of order, in the name of protecting and defending the United States of America.What led you to live such a life? What leads a person to put on that uniform; to wear that badge; to enter the law enforcement profession? Part of it, of course, is what leads any of us to pursue a profession -- a responsibility to provide for our wives and our husbands; to give our children and grandchildren a better life. For some, there’s also a family legacy to honor, a proud inheritance an officer may aspire to uphold.But there’s also another reason -- a higher calling -- that led the men and women we honor today, like so many of you, to become peace officers; a calling to serve our neighbors, a calling to serve our neighborhoods, a calling to live a life in service of others.It’s a calling that carries immense risk. You don’t know what dangers you’ll confront each time you put on that uniform or step outside in plain clothes. Whether you’re a beat patrolman or a road deputy, you don’t know what the next dispatch will bring. All you know is your duty -- to keep us safe, to keep our communities safe, to keep America safe. It is a duty you fulfill every single day.Today, we honor Americans who lost their lives in pursuit of that duty; in pursuit of that calling. We honor Traffic Sergeant Mark Dunakin, a 17-year veteran of Oakland’s Police Department. “A big Teddy bear,” his friends called him, who loved his Buckeyes and Steelers -- the kind of guy you could always count on to get you to do the right thing. Mark was killed on March 21, 2009, during a traffic stop at 74th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard. And he leaves behind his wife, Angela, and three children.We honor Deputy Burt Lopez, a 6-year veteran of Okaloosa County Sheriff Office in Florida. Big-hearted, Burt once delayed serving a minor warrant until a Sunday so that the defendant, a father of six, could earn one more day’s pay for his family. On April 25, 2009, Burt and Deputy Skip York were killed attempting to arrest a domestic assault suspect they had tracked down at a gun club in Crestville [sic]. Burt is survived by his wife, Michelle, and five children.We honor Trooper Joshua Miller, a veteran of both the Pennsylvania State Police and the United States Marine Corps. Josh, it’s been said, was a trooper’s trooper. The only thing he loved more than stopping drunk drivers and hunting was spending time with his wife, Angela, and their three daughters. His face lit up when you mentioned them. Josh was killed on June 7, 2009, during an operation that ultimately rescued a 9-year-old boy who’d been kidnapped by his father.We honor these Americans, and each of the law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty last year. Each loved. Each is missed. Each is among America’s finest. These men and women join nearly 19,000 Americans who’ve made such a sacrifice since Deputy Isaac Smith was shot investigating a disturbance at a New York tavern in 1792. Such a sacrifice -- such an honor roll –– is what makes it possible for us to go on about our lives; to pursue our dreams; to enjoy America’s freedoms.It is an honor roll engraved in stone not far from here, at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Guarding over the park -- and the memories of Americans memorialized there -- are four bronze lions. Beneath one is a verse from the Book of Proverbs I impart to you as a prayer: “The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.” May God’s face shine upon the lions that we have lost. May He watch over the ones that guard us still. And may He bless, now and forever, the United States of America. (Applause.)END	2010/05/15

Pretty much anything is fair game, so long as you remain in bed, earning a cool $1,200 per week...So what are the exact purposes of these studies?The experiments are designed to find ways of preserving astronauts health and safety during periods of extended space travel. Head down bed rest is a good way of simulating travel through zero gravity space. Think about it, zero gravity means zero weight or strain on your muscles. They also want to understand how marijuana will influence on the body.Its a more accessible way of analyzing the bodily changes that occur during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Understanding how ones changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.Understanding the impact of ones physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.Within the experiment there are two study groups: exercising and non-exercising.While the exercising group will be subject to exercise training (on special equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), the non-exercising group will remain completely at ease.The entire duration of the study actually lasts between 97 and 105 days, depending on whether youre a non-exercising or an exercising subject, respectively.For the first 13 days for non-exercising subjects and 21 days for exercising subjects, youre able to move freely (in and out of bed) within the bed rest facility.However, after this period you will be prohibited from leaving the bed for the next 70 days, aside from a few specified tests, where you must lay with your head back and feet up.Throughout the entire duration of the study, you will be subject to bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your bodys capacity to fight off infections.So is it worth it?Although spending two months in bed would realistically be excruciating, at least you can rest easily knowing youre making the sacrifice of grueling laziness for the purpose of furthering human space exploration.This is the only time you could claim to have helped send the first astronauts to Mars by doing absolutely nothing but sitting on your ass.Via: the Usual RoutineRelated PostsNASA Will Pay You $50,000/month to Stay in BedA UFO Is Closing in on Earth and NASA Is Covering It Up, According to YouTubersKatherine Johnson, the NASA Mathematician Who Advanced Human Rights with a Slide Rule and PencilIf NASA Found Alien Life, Would They Tell Us?

No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger, the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands.</span>Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign, however, are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops, a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around.Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip, the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right? Well, thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject, between you and me nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move.Besides, its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day, right? So, hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the Gods honest truth is without Hollywood, there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront it just becomes pointless, the spokesperson concluded.Facebook Twitter Google+LinkedIn	2018/07/17

This law, originally passed in 1940, provides for the protection of the bald eagle and the golden eagle (as amended in 1962) by prohibiting the take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald or golden eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest, or egg, unless allowed by permit(16 U.S.C. 668(a); 50 CFR 22). ""Take"" includes pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb (16 U.S.C. 668c; 50 CFR 22.3). The 1972 amendments increased civil penalties for violating provisions of the Act to a maximum fine of $5,000 or one year imprisonment with $10,000 or not more than two years in prison for a second conviction. Felony convictions carry a maximum fine of $250,000 or two years of imprisonment. The fine doubles for an organization. Rewards are provided for information leading to arrest and conviction for violation of the Act. Migratory Bird Treaty ActThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act is a Federal law that carries out the United States commitment to four international conventions with Canada, Japan, Mexico and Russia. Those conventions protect birds that migrate across international borders. The take of all migratory birds, including bald eagles, is governed by the Migratory Birds Treaty Acts regulations. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit (50 CFR 21.11). Additionally, the MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the take of migratory birds should be allowed and to adopt suitable regulations permitting and governing take (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemenor conviction. Fines double if the violator is an organization rather than an individual. The MBTA and its implementing regulations provide authority for the conservation of bald eagles and protect against take if the Endangered Species Act protections are removed. Lacey ActThe Lacy Act was passed in 1900, and protects bald eagles by making it a Federal offense to take, possess, transport, sell, import, or export their nests, eggs and parts that are taken in violation of any state, tribal or U.S. law. It also prohibits false records, labels, or identification of wildlife shipped, prohibits importation of injurious species and prohibits shipment of fish or wildlife in an inhumane manner. Penalties include a maximum of five years and $250,000 fine for felony convictions and a maximum $10,000 fine for civil violations and $250 for marking violations. Fines double for organizations.

She was the first live-in grandmother at the White House since Elivera M. Doud, the mother of Mamie Eisenhower, during the Eisenhower Administration.Critics say Mrs. Robinson should not profit from something as simple as taking care of family. Sally Kellner, volunteer/activist for the National Taxpayers Union , says this is a prime example of needless spending. “I think it’s ridiculous that taxpayers must pay this woman a lifetime salary for something everyday Americans do for free. We take care of our families because we love them, not for profit.”When asked if Mrs. Robinson’s lifetime pension was justified, Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, declined to comment but said a special oversight committee would review all post-Obama Administration budgetary obligations.Before her son-in-law became President of the United States, Mrs. Robinson had never been abroad. Now, after almost eight years of being the nation’s Grandmother-In-Chief, she’s a seasoned world traveler who has, accompanied by her granddaughters, been to Senegal, Tanzania, China and Italy, where she even met the Pope.“She’s been the rock of the family,” says Obama family friend and biographer Peter Slevin. “It’s been a real blessing for the girls (Malia & Sasha) to have their grandma with them during these formative years,” he said.Shortly after the 2008 presidential election, President Obama called Robinson “One of the unsung heroes” of his campaign, and said, “We couldn’t have done it without her.” First Lady Michelle Obama has said that if Robinson had not been available to step in and watch over the girls, Obama might never have launched his campaign.While holding no official job title, Mrs. Robinson likely qualified for her lifetime pension under the “optional” eligibility requirement for the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRS).	2016/10/17

He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded./politicops	2017/03/17

Looking at the size of the sock, every one assumed Melania must have left it as a happy birthday gift.Shes had trouble finding her husbands office, the aide clarified.It wasnt long before the signal became clear; Sessions efforts, declared Trump, were no longer required.Thats how Trump does it, said one long-time assistance. He fires people the way his father fired the maid. Hands them an article of clothing and expects them to find the door.Confusion filled the office when an extra-large pair of Fruit of the Loom briefs were found slung over Special Counsel Robert Muellers office chair. Upon inspection, it was determined that the size did not accord with Trumps own undergarments. Mueller has since been allowed to keep his job until adequate support for his brass balls can be found.Advertisements ShareTweetEmailMorePocketTelegramLike this:Like Loading...Related	2017/06/15

She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!"	2017/06/07

It’s great to have you, Dave. How are you doing?CALLER: Hey, Rush, thanks for taking my call. Back during the campaign, I remember the Clintons released their tax records, and it showed they’d given this huge amount to charity. Of course, over 90% of that “charity” was the Clinton Foundation. It got me thinking: What’s become of the Clinton Foundation since the election?RUSH: It is disbanded. The Clinton Foundation is gone. There are two things. We still don’t know if there is an FBI investigation of Clinton Foundation. We believe that there was — and for quite a while — an investigation of the Clinton Foundation by the FBI. But we don’t know for sure. So it’s not known whether that investigation continued or not. The Clinton Foundation did not disburse 90% of their assets to charity, unless you are more informed than I. Are you telling me that in the last two weeks they did that, that you saw that?CALLER: No, no. I thought I recalled that during the campaign, when Hillary released their tax returns.RUSH: Oh, no, they’re lying about it! It’s just the exact opposite. They gave away the minimum amount. The Clinton Foundation was nothing more than a… (sigh) She was accepting donations from people to whom she was expected to grant favors. They were donating to her campaign. They were from all over the world — foreign governments, foreign individuals, foreign entities — and the idea was that she would repay with consideration when she was president. The Clinton Foundation had many parts.It was the Clinton Foundation and Global Initiative. That has disbanded as well. The fact that they’re gone or being wound down is prima facie evidence that they existed only to further political ambitions, that the idea that they’re there to help with disaster relief or people in need?

Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jon Tester (D-MT), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Jerry Moran (R-KS) and 27 other senators also cosponsored the bill. The legislation now moves to the U.S. House of Representatives.Specifically, this legislation would provide the VA Secretary the authority to discipline employees at all levels, and hold them accountable for their wrongdoing. It would also protect whistleblowers from retaliation and reprisal, require training of all VA employees about whistleblower protections, streamline the authority for the VA Secretary to rescind bonuses and relocation expense reimbursement when necessary, and allow reductions to certain retirement pensions upon conviction for misconduct.“This legislation is an important step forward in correcting the archaic and broken civil service system that has prevented the VA Secretary from removing bad actors, including those responsible for the scandal in care in Phoenix and around the country,” said Senator McCain. “This legislation provides the VA Secretary the authority needed to hold employees accountable for their wrongdoing, and strengthens protections for whistleblowers who are committed to the health and wellbeing of veterans. Our veterans deserve a VA they can have trust in, and these commonsense reforms are key to restoring that confidence. I urge the House of Representatives to quickly take-up and pass this much-needed measure for our veterans.”A one-page summary of the legislation can be found here .The legislation is here .	2017/06/10

Wearing jeans, a t-shirt and black biker jacket, Michaella was escorted by a female police. Both Michaella and Melissa were in handcuffs as they were placed into a waiting car and taken away. The young Irishwoman has spent the past 15 days in an anti-drugs unit in Lima. Her lawyer Peter Madden had earlier said that Michaella and co-accused Melissa Reid, both 20, will today be moved out of police custody in judicial custody. ""The girls will be moved, probably to Callao where the court is and will probably be held there for a day or two,"" he said. Mr Madden who will attend the hearing along with the two women's Peruvian lawyer said that they will both be tried together. ""It is a very short procedure, it will last maybe less than one hour, it will all be conducted privately, it will not be an open court, it will be more like an administrative process."" The women who were carrying over 11kg of cocaine in their luggage when arrested are likely to be tried together, meaning they will not face longer sentencing of 15 to 25 years. ""I think the consensus of opinion is that they will each be charged with just over 5kg; that is what we are hoping,"" Mr Madden said.He has also refuted allegations in the press over the weekend that Michaella owed €4,000 to drug dealers""That is not true, she was not involved in the drugs trade at all.""It is important to refute some of the things in the press that are not true, it is not helpful when false stories are put around, it doesn't help their case at all,"" he added.""She went to Ibiza at the end of June, where she had a number of jobs including waitressing, and promotional work. She was working hard when she was over there.""He also commented on the photographs which allegedly showing both women in Peru.""Although the photographs show them smiling and having a good time, that was all posed.""Remember, they were told that no harm would come to them if they followed instructions, and they were told to take photographs taken as tourists.""There was a [CCTV] video shown of Michaella walking near her hotel here in Lima, she was not carrying drugs as speculated, she was carrying her handbag.""Once the initial stages of the case are over, Mr Madden intends to prepare Michaella's defense case in coordination with her lawyer in Lima.""It will be complicated enough because there are a number of people in Ibiza that will have to be interviewed and I will have to check out a number of things. I will start as soon as I get back. ""It will be very expensive for her family members fly over here on a regular basis.

Insurance companies would be allowed to reduce coverage and to force patients to pay more out of pocket, meaning plans would provide less value to the consumer.Watch the video below from Fox News.Don't let Silicon Valley control what you see.

B. Lindsley, via Library of CongressBy Jackie CalmesApril 20, 2016WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Wednesday announced the most sweeping and historically symbolic makeover of American currency in a century, proposing to replace the slaveholding Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman , the former slave and abolitionist, and to add women and civil rights leaders to the $5 and $10 notes.Mr. Lew may have reneged on a commitment he made last year to make a woman the face of the $10 bill, opting instead to keep Alexander Hamilton, to the delight of a fan base swollen with enthusiasm over a Broadway rap musical based on the life of the first Treasury secretary.But the broader remaking of the nation’s paper currency , which President Obama welcomed on Wednesday, may well have captured a historical moment for a multicultural, multiethnic and multiracial nation moving contentiously through the early years of a new century.ImageFrom left, Sojourner Truth, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul and Elizabeth Cady Stanton will be featured on the back of the new $10 bill.CreditFrom left: Hulton Archive, via Getty Images; via Library of Congress: via Library of Congress; Hulton Archive, via Getty Images; Associated PressTubman, an African-American and a Union spy during the Civil War, would bump Jackson — a white man known as much for his persecution of Native Americans as for his war heroics and advocacy for the common man — to the back of the $20, in some reduced image along with the White House. Tubman would be the first woman so honored on paper currency since Martha Washington’s portrait briefly graced the $1 silver certificate in the late 19th century.While Hamilton would remain on the $10, and Abraham Lincoln on the $5, images of women would be added to the back of both — in keeping with Mr. Lew’s intent “to bring to life” the national monuments depicted there.The picture of the Treasury building on the back of the $10 bill would be replaced with a depiction of a 1913 march in support of women’s right to vote that ended at the building, along with portraits of five suffrage leaders: Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul and Susan B. Anthony, who in more recent years was on an unpopular $1 coin until minting ceased.On the flip side of the $5 bill, the Lincoln Memorial would remain, but as the backdrop for the 1939 performance there of Marian Anderson, the African-American classical singer, after she was barred from singing at the segregated Constitution Hall nearby. Sharing space on the rear would be images of Eleanor Roosevelt, who arranged Anderson’s Lincoln Memorial performance, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who in 1963 delivered his “I have a dream” speech from its steps.The final redesigns will be unveiled in 2020, the centennial of the 19th Amendment establishing women’s suffrage, and will not go into wide circulation until later in the decade, starting with the new $10 note. The unexpectedly ambitious proposals reflect Mr. Lew’s tortuous attempt to expedite the process and win over critics who have lodged conflicting demands, pitting mainly women’s advocates against Hamiltonians newly empowered by the unlikely success of their hero’s story on Broadway.Mr. Lew’s design proposals are the culmination of 10 months of often-heated public commentary that began almost immediately after he invited Americans last June to help him decide which woman from history to honor on the $10 bill. That feel-good initiative proved to be hardly as simple as he first imagined.ImageEleanor Roosevelt, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Marian Anderson will be depicted on the back of the new $5 bill.CreditFrom left: Keystone, via Getty Images; Allyn Baum/The New York Times; London Express, via Getty ImagesImmediately an online group called Women on 20s insisted that the woman to be honored — Tubman was its choice — had to go on the more common $20 note, displacing not the popular Hamilton but Jackson, whose place in history has suffered lately with attention to his record of forcibly relocating Native Americans, supporting slavery and — despite his prominence on currency — opposing a national banking system and paper money. But the $10 was next in line for redesign, based on federal officials’ assessment of counterfeiting threats.Yet other women mobilized by the Girls’ Lounge , a networking organization for female corporate leaders, demanded that a woman go on the $10 note, as Mr. Lew first proposed, because they did not want to wait years for a new $20 bill. Within the administration, Rosie Rios, who as treasurer of the United States oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, was also pushing for a woman on the $10 bill.But nothing so roiled the debate as the phenomenon of the musical “Hamilton.”Weighing in for his place on the $10 bill were well-to-do theater patrons and teenagers rapping to the soundtrack, as well as the show’s creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda. When Mr. Lew and his wife caught a performance last August, the Treasury secretary hinted to Mr. Miranda that Hamilton would stay. Just this week, the show won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.VideoThe Treasury announced that instead of a woman replacing Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill, Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the much more widely circulated $20 bill.Published OnApril 20, 2016By July, in fact, Mr. Lew already had decided to keep his long-ago predecessor on the $10 note, and put a vignette of suffragists on the back, with Tubman scheduled for the $20 bill and changes to the $5 note as well.“I had a kind of ‘aha’ moment where I said we’re thinking too small,” Mr. Lew said on Wednesday.He decided to redesign all three notes to accommodate the various views, and sooner. As for the choice of Tubman, he said that in the public comments he reviewed each night, “the pattern became clear that Harriet Tubman struck a chord with people in all parts of the country, of all ages.”“This is a good solution,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who wrote to the secretary “strongly suggesting he not remove Hamilton” from the bill.ImageHarriet Tubman’s death announcement in the The New York Times in 1913.Mr. Lew directed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to hasten the redesign of the $20 and $5 notes at the same time. Subsequent production of the $10 bill would take precedence, though Mr. Lew said all three notes could be in wallets before 2030. The final decision on release is up to the Fed.One wild card is that Mr. Lew and President Obama have just months left in office. But Mr. Lew expressed confidence that his successors would not veto the currency makeovers.“I don’t think somebody’s going to probably want to do that — to take the image of Harriet Tubman off of our money? To take the image of the suffragists off?” he said.Not since 1929 has American currency undergone such a far-reaching change. That year all paper money changed, with more standard designs and smaller size to save costs.In advance of Mr. Lew’s decision, the emotion that the Treasury initiative had prompted was reflected in a letter to the Treasury secretary on Tuesday evening. More than three dozen women including actors, feminists, corporate executives and journalists objected to preliminary news reports that he was planning to renege on putting a woman on the $10 face, calling it, if true, “a major blow to the advancement of women.”They admonished the Treasury secretary, saying: “ Could there be a better metaphor for second-class status that continues to limit our girls?”The signers included the actresses Ellen DeGeneres, Geena Davis and Jane Lynch; the former soccer star Abby Wambach; former Representative Gabrielle Giffords; the news media figures Katie Couric and Arianna Huffington; the feminist leader Gloria Steinem; and the photographer Annie Leibovitz.Mr. Lew’s compromise did not satisfy the letter writers since the new note, the $10 bill, will picture women on the back. But Women on 20s released a statement “celebrating” the decision, despite Mr. Lew’s inability to say how quickly the government can accelerate a new $20 note given technological and production complexities.Yet, as Mr. Lew said Wednesday: “I said we were going to listen. We really did listen.”Correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of slaves escorted to freedom by Harriet Tubman. It was hundreds, not thousands.

""There was nowhere near close enough to go forward in my opinion.""Doucette also pointed out Bellmay's alleged misconduct happened prior to being on City Council and there was no evidence the vice mayor misused the office.""I'm glad that the courts decided to judge the way in which they did, and now I'm really looking forward to us continuing the work here in the city of Charlottesville,"" said Bellamy.""I disagree with Mike Doucette's assessment, but there we are. We'll look to see if there are ways we can appeal it,"" Kessler said.When asked if he would seek out the required 1,580 signatures to file a new removal petition, Kessler said he was ready to move on.Bellamy says he has no ill will toward Kessler and that the blogger did what was within his rights.""People don't always have to like you.

A conjunction is a celestial event in which two planets or a planet and the moon or a planet and a star appear close together in the night sky. Conjunctions have no real astronomical value, but they are nice to view. While conjunctions aren’t as rare as one might think, this conjunction of Jupiter and Venus will be more impressive than most.The casual backyard observer may have noticed that these two planets have been moving closer together for the past few weeks. On June 30, they will be so close that one will be able to hold a finger up and cover both Jupiter and Venus at the same time. In reality, the planets are hundreds of millions of miles apart. On June 30, Venus is about 46 million miles from Earth, and Jupiter is 560 million miles from Earth. Looking up at the sky, Venus appears to be much brighter than Jupiter. That is only because Venus is so much closer to Earth. Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is actually over 11 times bigger than Venus, but it is dimmer when looking at the sky because of its great distance from our planet.Typically the best conditions for stargazing involve a dark sky, so getting away from urban areas will make stars and faint objects like nebulae and galaxies more visible. The Jupiter and Venus conjunction will be easily bright enough to see from any location, even large cities. The best hours for viewing will be during evening twilight and up until 10:30 PM local time, when the planets will set behind the western horizon.	2015/06/30

Accompanied by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, President Trump and the First Lady walked alongside one another, placing a white flower and small stone on each of the 11 stars erected in a makeshift memorial outside the synagogue. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner followed a few steps behind, pausing at each star. Inside the synagogue, the President and First Lady lit candles for each of the 11 victims. Before leaving Pittsburgh, President Trump visited with wounded law enforcement officers and injured victims at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s Presbyterian Hospital. “These were very brave officers.

This investment has received criticism as the United States makes an effort to slash nearly $4 trillion in government spending.Plenty of outrage following the announcement made Thursday afternoon by a government commission that suggested huge cuts to the budget, including eliminating the interest education for home mortgage. This juxtaposed with United States investing millions to refurbish mosques as a good-will effort in Muslim countries has upset many taxpayer groups.The Channel 2 Action News investigation found a 1,300-year-old Egyptian mosque that was almost flooded by contaminated sewer water that is one of many ancient Cairo mosques and churches that were saved from destruction by the U.S. taxpayers.This is part of a $770 million program to rebuild Cairo's sewer system, paid for by the U.S. State Department's USAID program.""We are spending money we don't have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,"" said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate.Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.""I think it is very hard to explain to the American taxpayer right now whose having an extraordinary time paying bills and making ends meet that this is why we took this out of your paycheck, so we can fund this,"" said Thomas.The State Department declined a Channel 2 Action News request for an interview. We wanted to ask why are we using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas. The State Department did send Channel Two Action News an e-mail saying that they are fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.Egyptian-American human rights activist Nonie Darwish told Channel 2 Action News anchor Justin Farmer that trying to buy respect in the Middle East only shows our weakness.""This part of the world has a lot of respect for power and America is not showing its power, it's showing its appeasement. They are laughing all the way to the bank,"" said Darwish.Darwish was born in Egypt and is now a former Muslim. Darwish told Farmer that she moved to America and has written several books critical of radical Islam.

Rowling Apologizes for Anti-Trump Tweets (but Not to Trump)ImagePresident Trump crouching to greet Montgomery Weer during an event at the White House last month.CreditCreditTom Brenner/The New York TimesBy Dan BilefskyAug. 1, 2017LONDON — Parsing what is real and what is not isn’t always easy in the age of social media and fake news, as J. K. Rowling, arguably the world’s most popular and beloved fantasy writer, has discovered.Ms. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, provoked a barrage of criticism on social media and beyond after accusing President Trump of willfully ignoring Montgomery Weer, a 3-year-old boy with spina bifida who uses a wheelchair, during an event late last month at the White House.“How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President,” wrote the author, a canny Twitter user who has adeptly fended off critics with the aplomb of a Hogwarts magic spell.“My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it,” she wrote on Twitter in comments that have since been deleted. “So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child’s head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw.”Problem is, it appears Ms. Rowling did not check her facts. She made a false assumption based on widely circulated, but incomplete, video footage.ImageJ.K. RowlingCreditLefteris Pitarakis/Associated PressThe boy’s mother, Marjorie Kelly Weer, wrote in a post on Facebook over the weekend that Ms. Rowling had misinterpreted the situation. “If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didn’t snub my son & Monty wasn’t even trying to shake his hand,” she wrote, adding that Monty didn’t much like shaking hands.The raw video footage showed that Mr. Trump had crouched down to shake the boy’s hand. He appeared to have gently touched the child’s left elbow, as the boy lifted his clenched left hand.Ms. Rowling apologized to the boy and his family, but not to Mr. Trump.“Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction,” Ms. Rowling wrote on Twitter on Monday. “I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly.”Ms. Rowling added that she had subsequently deleted the original tweets, though screenshots of them survive online. A spokeswoman for Ms. Rowling said the author would not comment further.Ms. Rowling, who may be the world’s most powerful author, has made clear that she is no fan of Mr. Trump, the world’s most powerful politician.That was clear even before he became president. Two years ago, Ms. Rowling wrote that Mr. Trump was worse than Lord Voldemort, the cruel and malevolent wizard of the “Harry Potter” books and films.Ms. Rowling appears unlikely to refrain from posting future criticisms. “That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect,” she wrote on Twitter.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Rowling’s Mea Culpa on Trump.

Mike Pence of Indiana bans abortions motivated solely by objections to the fetus’s race, gender or disability.CreditCreditChad Ryan/The Journal-Gazette, via Associated PressBy Mitch SmithMarch 24, 2016CHICAGO — Indiana’s governor signed a bill on Thursday that adds broad limits to women’s access to abortions, banning those motivated solely by the mother’s objection to the fetus’s race, gender or disability, and placing new restrictions on doctors.The law , which passed both chambers of the Republican-controlled General Assembly with large majorities, builds on Indiana’s already restrictive abortion rules, and was cheered by anti-abortion groups that had encouraged Gov. Mike Pence to sign it.“We are pleased that our state values life no matter an individual’s potential disability, gender or race,” Mike Fichter, president and chief executive of Indiana Right to Life , said in a statement. “We also believe that the other measures in the bill are positive steps forward for providing dignity and compassion.”The bill is among several limiting abortion that have passed conservative legislatures in recent years, but the sheer number of restrictions in Indiana’s legislation made it distinct.In addition to holding doctors liable if a woman has an abortion solely because of objections to the fetus’s race, sex or a disability, like Down syndrome, the law restricts fetal tissue donation and requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital or to have an agreement with a doctor who does.“Seeing them all in one place, that is very striking,” said Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has been an abortion rights advocate. “It’s like the kitchen sink: Everything that isn’t already in the law. And the law is already really restrictive.”Mr. Pence, a Republican, said he signed the bill because he thinks “that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable — the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn.”The bill, he said in his signing statement, “will ensure the dignified final treatment of the unborn and prohibits abortions that are based only on the unborn child’s sex, race, color, national origin, ancestry or disability, including Down syndrome.”He added, “Some of my most precious moments as governor have been with families of children with disabilities, especially those raising children with Down syndrome.”The measure drew a sharp rebuke from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and other abortion rights groups, and the law returned Indiana to the center of a national debate about social issues.Last year, Mr. Pence signed a religious objections bill perceived by many as antigay, prompting some corporations to threaten to stop doing business in Indiana unless the law was changed. Within days, Mr. Pence signed a so-called fix to that law saying that it did not allow discrimination.Mr. Pence, who had been seen before the religious objections episode as a possible presidential contender, was widely criticized for his handling of the matter. In its aftermath, his political stock plummeted, and he is currently engaged in a re-election race that many expect to be close.Thursday was Mr. Pence’s deadline to act on the abortion bill, and he waited until late in the day to announce his decision.Some abortion rights advocates said that portions of the law could be challenged in court. State Representative Linda Lawson, a Democrat who opposed the measure, said the new law came close to an effective ban on abortions in the state.“They’ve been on a mission, the Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly, to make sure that affordable health care and abortion is no longer available for women in the state of Indiana,” said Ms. Lawson, who suggested that the law was most likely to affect poor women who might not be able to travel to other states to seek abortions.The law could also put some doctors who perform abortions in jeopardy if it is learned that a woman told them that she chose to end her pregnancy because of gender, disabilities or other reasons limited by the law.Many of the provisions in the Indiana law have been enacted previously in at least one other state. Arizona also bans abortion on the basis of race, and North Dakota has outlawed abortions performed because the fetus has a disability.Professor Johnsen said the Indiana legislation was “a clear attempt to interfere and harm and chill doctors’ willingness to perform abortions.”But Dr. Christina Francis, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Fort Wayne, Ind., who works with anti-abortion groups, said that it stopped far short of a ban, and that “a woman can still procure an abortion just because she wants to.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Indiana Governor Signs Abortion Bill With Added Restrictions.

John McCain in criticizing the decision.""The speaker does not agree with this decision,” said Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan. “Law enforcement officials have a special responsibility to respect the rights of everyone in the United States. We should not allow anyone to believe that responsibility is diminished by this pardon.""Trump on Friday spared Arpaio, from the Phoenix area, the prospect of serving jail time in granting the first presidential pardon of his turbulent tenure, wiping away the lawman's recent federal conviction stemming from his immigration patrols that focused on Latinos.“The president has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions,” McCain said after the Friday pardon announcement.The pardon has received support from other Arizona Republicans, including Rep. Trent Franks, who said the ex-lawman is a “patriot.”“In his last days, (President) Obama commuted the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning -- a treasonous intelligence analyst who shared a trove of intelligence with the infamous Wikileaks,” Franks, R-Ariz., said Saturday in a statement to Fox News.“While no one can dispute Manning acted to undermine our country's national security, Joe Arpaio has spent a lifetime trying to maintain it. … It is easy to discern that Arpaio is a patriot, while Manning is a traitor.”Beyond McCain and Ryan, top congressional Republicans -- including frequent Trump target Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky -- have yet to issue public statements on the pardoning.However, top congressional Democrats seized on the pardoning in their continuing efforts to throttle Trump’s presidency and lay ground work for the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 White House contest.""We’re sick to our stomach. Donald Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a fundraising letter Saturday.Anne Kirkpatrick, a former prosecutor trying to unseat Arizona GOP Rep. Martha McSally, late Friday night said Arpaio instituted “racist” police policies and attacked Republicans for not opposing the pardon.“Those who remain silent are complicit,” the Arizona Democrat said in a fundraising letter.The White House said Friday that the 85-year-old Arpaio was a ""worthy candidate"" for the pardon, citing his ""life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.""Trump granted the pardon less than a month after a judge found Arpaio -- the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County until losing re-election last year -- guilty of a misdemeanor contempt-of-court charge in a trial that was prosecuted by the president's own Justice Department.""Pardoning Joe Arpaio is a slap in the face to the people of Maricopa County, especially the Latino community and those he victimized as he systematically and illegally violated their civil rights,"" said Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat.Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said Arpaio should be given credit for his crime-fighting efforts and allowed to ""move on"" and enjoy his retirement.Arpaio earned a national reputation by taking aggressive action to arrest immigrants in the country illegally. But years of legal issues and related costs took a toll on his political power at home, and he was handily defeated by a Democrat in the 2016 election.Arpaio defied court orders that he stop the patrols.Trump issued the pardon seven months after taking office, though it is not unprecedented for a president to issue a pardon in their first year in office.George H. W. Bush granted clemency after seven months in office, said Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of politics at American University who wrote a book on presidential pardons.President Bill Clinton ignited a major controversy on his final day in office with a last-minute pardon for fugitive financier Marc Rich, the ex-husband of a major Democratic fundraiser.Fox News’ Mike Emanuel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Trending in Politics"	2017/08/26

Marchers brought traffic to a standstill downtown after gathering at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights near Centennial Olympic Park. Drivers in cars honked their horns as protesters holding signs and chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" streamed beside them. Francys Johnson, the state president of the NAACP, led the rally, which was organized by his organization and Black Lives Matter. He stood on the front line, arms locked with other protesters including radio personality Frank Ski. ""We're in critical times of our country,"" Johnson said. ""We are in a defining moment. We have experienced bloody conflict the past couple days. This march is to eradicate racism."" Before the march, Ski urged young people in attendance to learn their history and vote in elections.

""It's still a struggle,"" said Kram, who's lived in Atlanta for 16 years. ""I have a fear for myself. I want to one day have children in America, but I have fear of bringing them into a world filled with so many injustices to black people. I'm scared. I hope marches like this are a starting point to make a change."" Atlanta police Chief George Turner and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said earlier in the day that people have the right to protest this weekend but urged them to cooperate with law enforcement. Images from local news helicopters showed a peaceful march. The police chief said his officers are being told to stay ""vigilant and professional"" after the Dallas shooting that killed five officers and wounded seven others. A gunman shot the Dallas officers and two civilians during a peaceful protest Thursday night, authorities said. The protests erupted over the recent shootings of black men by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and suburban St. Paul, Minnesota. The Atlanta march started at the park, moved down the city's popular Peachtree Street and to CNN Center. A number of NAACP members gave directions. Numerous state trooper patrol cars and Atlanta Police Department officers blocked an entrance ramp to Interstate 75/85 where a portion of the protesters tried to enter the highway. At one point, protesters jumped onto a semitrailer that had driven into the area. Reed joined the crowd there later and, invoking the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., told protesters he respected their First Amendment rights to protest but wanted to keep them safe, so he would not let them move onto the freeway.

Qureshi becomes first American Muslim federal judicial nomineeSept. 6, 2016—Today President Obama nominated Abid R. Qureshi to serve as a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A litigation partner at Latham & Watkins LLP in Washington, DC, Mr. Qureshi is the first American Muslim to be nominated to serve on the federal judiciary.“I commend President Obama for taking this important step in continuing to pick the best and brightest from every community to serve as part of our nation’s judiciary,” said Farhana Khera, former counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and executive director of Muslim Advocates, a national legal advocacy organization. “A judiciary that reflects the rich diversity of our nation helps ensure the fair and just administration of the law, and it is vital for American Muslims to be included. Mr. Qureshi’s profound commitment to the rule of law and justice for people of all backgrounds makes him an exceptional nominee.”Mr. Qureshi has a long and distinguished legal career. He has served as lead counsel in numerous trials before state and federal courts across the country and has represented clients at the trial and appellate levels and before state and federal regulators and national and international arbitral tribunals. Mr. Qureshi has also served as Chair of Latham’s Global Pro Bono Committee since 2012, overseeing one of the world’s largest pro bono programs. His pro bono work has included working with Muslim Advocates on two cutting edge civil rights cases.Mr. Qureshi is the recipient of the “Champions of Justice” Award in 2012 by the National Law Journal’s Legal Times for upholding the profession’s core values through public service, pro bono work, and advocacy for civil liberties. In 2014, he was included in the Washington, DC Super Lawyers list, which recognizes individuals who have distinguished themselves in their legal practice. Mr. Qureshi sits on the DC Bar Legal Ethics Committee. He is a graduate of Cornell University and Harvard Law School.While a number of American Muslims have served with distinction as judges at the state level, there has never been a Muslim judge at the federal trial or appellate levels. Muslim Advocates calls for a prompt hearing and full and fair consideration of this sterling nominee by the U.S. Senate.	2016/09/06

Their right-wing nationalist slogan, “Blood and Soil,” romanticizes the notion that people with “white blood” have a special bond with “American soil.” This philosophy originated in Germany (as Blut und Boden) and was popularized by Hitler’s regime. VA uses “For Race and Nation” as an alternative slogan. Along those lines, the VA manifesto (as of April 2018) maintains that “The racial stock of this nation was created for white Christian Anglo/Europeans by white Christian Anglo/Europeans. All other ethnicities, races, religions and demographics are absolutely not compatible with this nation’s original culture. With such being stated, a mass exodus, isolation, apartheid, segregation and/or separation must be implemented to retain the good order and longevity of the country.”Originally, VA (then called American Vanguard), was firmly in the alt-right hemisphere, and focused on white identity. Over time, however, VA has increasingly embraced a neo-Nazi ideology. In one iteration of their manifesto, posted in February 2017, the VA explained that America was built on the foundation of White European culture and that the “glory of the Aryan nation must be recaptured.” VA has also warned against the influence of “the international Jew,” tweeting in July 2017, “Those behind the subversive elements eroding our culture often have something in common. Jewish influence is prevalent, invasive, dangerous.” This theme is echoed in their 2018 manifesto, which states that “Islam, Judaism and all other non-European or foreign religions” should not have the freedom to practice in the United States.Beware the International Jew (Vanguard America website)In 2017, VA broadened their ties to the neo-Nazi movement when they participated in white supremacist rallies in Pikeville, Kentucky (April), and Shelbyville, Tennessee (October). These events were organized by the Nationalist Front (NF), an umbrella organization of neo-Nazis, traditional white supremacists and racist skinheads. VA became a member of the NF following the April rally.Organizational structureDillon Ulysses Hopper (previously known as Dillon Irizarry), a Marine Corps veteran from New Mexico, has been leading the group since early 2016. During an April 2017 speech at a private NF gathering in Kentucky, Irizarry said that VA started in California in 2015. Irizarry also said that the “future is about the youth” and (for that reason) his group base is 18 to 24 years old. At the time, he also claimed approximately 200 members in 20 states.Dillon Hopper speaks during ""White Lives Matter"" rally in Shelbyville, TN.VA has some paramilitary characteristics. In states with open carry laws, members, including Hopper, who uses the title “Commander,” have openly carried firearms during rallies and protests. The standard uniform for members consists of khaki pants and a white polo shirt. At several venues, members have stood and marched in military-style formations, and utilized military facing movements and rest positions.Membership is typically male. However, VA does have a women’s division. In June 2017, VA tweeted, “The woman has her own battlefield. With every child that she brings into the world, she fights her battle for the nation. Strong nations grow from strong families. Vanguard America Women’s Division.”From November 2016 to April 2017, Vanguard America increased its ranks, and counted active members in Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas and Washington.Diminishing ReturnsThe group’s high point was June 17, 2017, when several dozen VA members participated in a “Texas is Ours” rally at the state capital in Austin. Hopper spoke at the event, and was joined by Thomas Rousseau, the leader of VA’s Texas chapter. After the event Hopper complained that Rousseau led event organizers to believe that Rousseau, not Hopper, was VA’s leader, and that Rousseau’s lengthy speech at the rally further confused people about the group’s leadership.VA members stand in formation during the “Texas is Ours” rally.A few days after the Austin rally, Rousseau began his takeover of the VA’s servers and its website. In an exchange that was posted on Twitter, Hopper detailed Rousseau’s apparent betrayal, writing, “On June 20, Thomas underhandedly and deceitfully exiled me from all Vanguard discord servers that HE controlled due to ‘security reasons.’ I logged off…and when I got back an hour later I was banned from every single server, including the women’s server. It was literally a coup with the guise that I left to handle family matters.”Just a few weeks later, with Hopper conspicuously absent, Rousseau led several dozen Vanguard America Texas members and associates at the August 12th “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Though Rousseau led the Unite the Right contingent, it was Hopper who faced derision in the rally’s aftermath when event images showed James Alex Fields Jr., who is accused of plowing his car into a group of counter-protesters and killing Heather Heyer, at the event standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Vanguard America members, and carrying a shield bearing the group’s fascist symbol. VA has denied that Fields was ever a member of their group.In late August 2017, as Hopper isolated himself from the fallout from Unite the Right, Rousseau seized the moment. Rather than take over the troubled Vanguard America name, he opted to rebrand VA’s “bloodandsoil.org” as the Patriot Front website. The move allowed Rousseau’s followers to distance themselves from both Vanguard America and any association with James Fields. Ironically, many of those who defected to Rousseau’s Patriot Front also attended “Unite the Right” under the Vanguard America umbrella.Following the August split, Patriot Front slowly siphoned away VA members from other parts of the country, and VA membership and activity dropped off dramatically. When Hopper spoke at the October 2017 “White Lives Rally” in Shelbyville he was supported by a crew of just seven VA members.VA members pose with Hopper (center) during the Shelbyville rally.VA was further diminished in January 2018, when more infighting and accusations of ineffective leadership led to the formation of a second splinter group, National Socialist Legion (NSL). NSL is a neo-Nazi group whose strategy (according to a March 2018 4chan post) is to set up homesteading cells around the country “for future white migration and eventual white revolt and secession.”VA members from Texas and Tennessee played a role in NSL’s creation. As of April 2018, the ADL has documented NSL activity (mostly in the form of flier distributions) and identified members in California, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Colorado.NSL’s symbol and one of the group’s fliers (found in Colorado)ActivityVanguard America is best known for posting white supremacist flyers at universities across the country throughout the 2016-2017 school year; ADL counted thirty-two incidents during that time in Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Washington. The group’s campus fliering continued during the 2017-2018 school year, but to a lesser extent and with a smaller geographical reach: just fourteen incidents in Arizona, Tennessee, Texas, and Massachusetts.In addition to distributing racist and anti-Semitic fliers on campus, Vanguard America has directly targeted Jewish and Hispanic institutions with hateful propaganda. Incidents include:Dallas, Texas, March 3, 2018: Racist, anti-immigration VA fliers were found at the Casa Guanajuato Community Center.Rome, Georgia, October 13, 2017: An anti-Semitic VA flier was posted at a synagogue: “America will bathe in the light of the black sun! The tide of Jewish Globalism wanes.”Houston, Texas, July 16, 2017: Two synagogues reported anti-Semitic VA flyers taped to signs, doors and gates on their property.Lakewood, New Jersey, July 2, 2017: An anti-Semitic VA banner was hung at the Holocaust memorial.Shreveport, Louisiana, March 11, 2017: VA stickers were reported at two synagogues.Vanguard America has also organized small public events and participated in events organized by other white supremacist groups. These events have included events focused on the preservation of Confederate monuments, anti-Muslim protests and events billed as “free speech rallies.” Recent public activity includes:Providence, Rhode Island, January 20, 2018: A VA banner bearing the words, “feminists deserve the rope” was hung over a nearby overpass during the Women’s March.Toledo, Ohio, December 4, 2017: VA posters were placed over a Black Lives Matter banner at Toledo University and on the door of the Lucas County Democratic Party officeShelbyville, Tennessee, October 28, 2017: Approximately seven VA members, led by Hopper, attended a Nationalist Front-organized “White Lives Matter” rally.Charlottesville, Virginia, August 12, 2017: Several dozen VA members, along with other groups associated with the Nationalist Front, participated in the Unite the Right rally.Austin, Texas, July 16, 2017: VA members waved a “For Race and Nation” banner from a highway overpass.Washington D.C., June 25, 2017: VA members participated in a free speech rally with Richard Spencer and Identity Evropa.

The bill, SB 239, will reduce the penalties for knowingly exposing someone to HIV without telling them, allowing HIV positive people to donate their blood to others. Lawmakers claim the current felony charge for the crime is discriminatory.Foxnews.com reports: State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who introduced the bill, said the current law discriminates against people with HIV because people who expose others with different viruses get only a misdemeanor rather than a felony.Right now HIV is singled out for uniquely harsh treatment as a felony, Wiener said during the floor debate, according to the L.A. Times. He added that modern drugs allow someone with HIV to be noninfectious to others, while the felony charge may discourage some from getting tested.These laws do not prevent HIV infections. All they do is stigmatize people living with HIV and reduce access to testing and care.These laws do not prevent HIV infections. All they do is stigmatize people living with HIV and reduce access to testing and care. State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco DemocratThe bill if passed would also apply to people who donated semen or blood without disclosing they have HIV or AIDS.All Republicans came out against the bill, claiming a reduction in penalties for exposing someone to HIV puts the public at risk.Im of the mind that if you purposefully inflict another with a disease that alters their lifestyle the rest of their life, puts them on a regiment of medications to maintain any kind of normalcy, it should be a felony, state Sen. Joel Anderson, of San Diego, said, the L.A. Times reported.Its absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this, he added, suggesting tougher penalties should be applicable to those with other diseases.Its absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this. State Sen. Joel Anderson, San DiegoJeff Stone, a Republican senator and former pharmacist from Murrieta, said the law should remain unchanged as someone exposing their partner to HIV would condemn one to probably $1 million in drug therapy for the rest of their lives.

They acknowledged the move was largely symbolic. “This is something that I think is more importantly about sending a clear message than it is about actually trying to strive for the institution to actually give out free tuition to everybody,” Anderson told the student newspaper. No tricks, all treats! Save 70% on digital access! Senators Brian Anderson and Andrea Ambam speak on Resolution 6-17-S. The resolution also called for WKU to create a special task forceto research test-optional and geographically-weighted admissions. Some senators disagreed with the resolution, saying that other students would eventually have to foot the bill for offering free tuition. The measure passed 19-10. In a statement, WKU President Gary Ransdell said Thursday that he appreciated the student government’s interest in the issue, but rejected the idea. “I have read the SGA resolution, and I understand that their intent was to spark a conversation, but the university will not adopt any such policy,” Ransdell said.	2017/04/20

Allard. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch decided to do something the Supreme Court has never done before: issued a warrant for someone’s arrest to appear before the bench.Allard has already been found in contempt of court for failing to answer subpoenas to the 26th District Court in DC and the 17th District Court of Appeals after that. Now he has the entirety of US law enforcement looking to place him front-and-center before the most powerful panel in the world.Allard’s attorney continues to claim that his client is “unavailable” and has himself been charged with obstructing a federal investigation for not revealing Allard’s location. Allard, a close friend and college activist friend of Barack Obama, is needed to answer one simple question: Was he ordered by the chief executive to transfer funds from the trust fund to the general fund without the approval of Congress.Allard isn’t expected to appear.

Citizens in Montana were shocked to get a perfect example of why there aren’t that many Muslim judges and why there were none until very recently.The “Honorable” Rahid Musad, a judge in the 19th Circuit Court, heard a horrifying case on Monday. A Muslim man who came to the United States from Iran wanted to get married and felt he was oppressed because he wasn’t allowed.Why wasn’t he allowed? Well, for starters his “fiancee” is nine years old.Malik Malam entered the United States in 2005 on a work visa and was granted citizenship in 2012. Then he fell in “love” with the daughter of his neighbor, Sherry Smithers.As Smithers and Malam became friends, he spent a lot of time converting her to Islam, which teaches that marrying (and everything associated with marriage) was not only acceptable, but was the will of Allah. Ultimately, Smithers agreed to marry her daughter off to this slimeball. But when they filled out the paperwork for the “wedding,” they were told that this was not allowed in the United States.Undeterred, Smithers and Malam filed a lawsuit demanding that the “marriage” be allowed as a protected action under the First Amendment freedom of religion. They lost, but appealed and found themselves standing before Judge Musad, who agreed with these sick people that child marriage is a protected religious activity under Islam.Thanks to their fellow Muslim, the “wedding” is scheduled for December.When Donald Trump proposed the travel ban, it wasn’t because he is a bigot like liberals claim. It was because Muslims and Americans have completely different moral codes. It was to protect the children.Related	2017/10/25

On Thursday the House passed a bill that will make microchipping Americans legal.The bill is known as Kevin and Avonte’s Law, and the idea behind it is that mentally disabled people who are microchipped will be easy to locate if they get lost. This is a giant step toward universal microchipping of everyone. Unfortunately, most Americans did not even realize that this bill was being discussed.H.R. 4919, which passed 346 to 66 in the lower chamber, mandates the U.S. attorney general award grants to law enforcement officials so that those agencies can create, establish and operate “locative tracking technology programs.” The bill was approved by a margin of almost 300 votes which means that it had support from representatives in both parties. Now we wait and see what the Senate will do, and then it will be up to our President to either veto it or not.Giving police the authority to decide who is micro-chipped and who is not based on their mental soundness is a recipe for disaster. Though the bill specifically mentions those with Alzheimer and autism, how long before these tracking programs are extended to those with ADHD and Bipolar disorder among other officially recognized disorders? Even the dislike of authority is considered a mental disorder known as “Oppositional Defiant Disorder.”In reality the bill opens the door to give police the ability to microchip dissenters, and force cooperation on the part of the general population. In effect anyone who doesn’t go along with the mass conditioning will be labeled ""mentally ill"" and branded with a track-and-control chip. At the first sign of suspicious behavior, a troubling social media profile, or a misunderstanding during an encounter, police and medical personnel will have the authority to declare someone ‘mentally disabled’ (or incapacitated, or temporarily insane, or unsound of mind, or whatever label is handy) just because they express discontent, anger or outage at the state of the world and political affairs. “Fake news” journalists can be shut down, and “conspiracy minded” individuals controlled… and of course, it will be abused which will lead to a very nasty police state.A few members of Congress that understood the dangers of this bill…“While this initiative may have noble intentions, ‘small and temporary’ programs in the name of safety and security often evolve into permanent and enlarged bureaucracies that infringe on the American people’s freedoms. That is exactly what we have here. A safety problem exists for people with Alzheimer’s, autism and other mental health issues, so the fix, we are told, is to have the Department of Justice start a tracking program so we can use some device or method to track these individuals 24/7,” Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said in a floor speech opposing the bill.We can’t let this happen.

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “ unreasonable searches and seizures ” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment .The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents , Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.	2017/10/17

Nancy Pelosi, D-California, emerges from a meeting of House Democrats Thursday, after her election as minority leader. Story ToolsBorn: March 26, 1940, age 62Family: Married Paul Pelosi; five grown children; five grandchildrenPolitical Career: Elected House minority leader; first woman to lead either party in Congress.Represents 8th District, California (San Francisco)First elected in 1987; never lost an election House minority whip in 107th CongressRanking Democratic member of the House Intelligence CommitteeEducation: Trinity College, Washington, undergraduate degree in political science, 1962Quote: ""What the Democrats will do, working together, is to build consensus around an economic growth message. And that will be right down the center, so its not about contrast right to left. It's about a message for economic growth.""WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a history-making move, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, was elected House minority leader by Democrats Thursday, becoming the first woman to lead either party in Congress.""I didn't run as a woman,"" said Pelosi, a liberal who represents San Francisco. ""I ran again as a seasoned politician and experienced legislator. It just so happens that I am a woman, and we have been waiting a long time for this moment.""Emerging from the caucus room to applause, Pelosi promised to invigorate Democratic voters and to seek ""common ground"" with Republicans in the fight against terrorism, the economy and other issues. But, she added, where there are differences with the GOP, ""We will put up the fight.""Pelosi, 62, launched her campaign for the minority leader's post last week after Richard Gephardt, D-Missouri, announced that he would step aside, following Democratic losses in the midterm elections.Pelosi, re-elected easily last week to her ninth term in the House, faced a challenge for the leadership post from Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio dropped out of the race Thursday morning, and Pelosi -- minority whip in the 107th Congress -- defeated Ford by a 177-29 vote, taken behind closed doors.Elegant and poised, Pelosi has won friends in the House both for her personable manner and her fund-raising skills, where she has raised money for other Democrats in the House. She is a reliable liberal vote in the House. She voted recently against the congressional resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq and has consistently supported gay rights and opposed efforts to criminalize abortion.Pelosi is the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and she also serves on the House Appropriations Committee, two influential panels. She now faces the challenge of organizing a party shaken by the elections and facing a popular Republican president in the White House. She called her selection by her colleagues ""a staggering honor.""Married and the mother of five grown children, Pelosi is a Baltimore native and the daughter of a one-time mayor there.Some Republicans have expressed glee at the prospect of a Democrat from what is arguably the country's most liberal city leading the party, believing Pelosi is out of touch with most Americans.Pelosi dismissed the criticism.""It's kind of an old thing,"" she said. ""In California, we think in entrepreneurial and fresh ways about every issue, and if it comes down one side to the right or left of center, so be it.""House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, struck a diplomatic note Wednesday, saying he looked forward to working with Pelosi. But he also hinted that Republicans won't be shy about highlighting Pelosi's ideology.""I think Nancy will call herself a San Francisco liberal,"" Hastert said. ""So I don't think that's a problem.""In other Democratic leadership races, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland was elected to replace Pelosi as whip and Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey narrowly won the post of chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. He defeated Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut by a vote of 104-103. Menendez becomes the highest-ranking Hispanic in congressional history. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina was elected vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.House Republicans chose their leadership Wednesday, re-electing Hastert as speaker and elevating Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, from whip to majority leader. Missouri Rep. Roy Blunt took DeLay's spot as House majority whip.""We're worthy opponents,"" DeLay said of the respective leadership teams.The 108th Congress convenes in January.--CNN Capitol Hill Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this report.Story Tools"	2002/11/14

Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story:“My client’s main concern is that because of the yearbook thing, nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. She’s a victim and now she’ll be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate.Nothing about this is right. Nothing.”Nothing about this is wrong, jerk. Justice Moore is a fine, upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says he’s also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.Moore’s attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for women’s rights.About Flagg Eagleton 6 ArticlesFlagg Eagleton is the son of an American potato farmer and a patriot.

Bush, is that hes drunk the inside-the-beltway political Kookaid for so long that he actually believes his own spin. Poor guy went down for the third time in the denial goo long ago.Donald Trumps biggest critics all believe that the engine of all things good and serious emanates from the professional Fedzillacrats who apparently enjoy wallowing in the said goo of Washington, D.C. In a recent Politico article, Fleischer is quoted as saying, in part, that Donald Trump is like watching a roadside accident. Everybody pulls over to see the mess.Donald Trump is a mess? Maybe Mr. Fleischer should open up the political garbage can he and the majority of Fedzillacrats live in and take a look at the real, certifiable, rotting, stinking mess that has been caused by the professional scammers of both political stripes for the past 50 years.What do YOU think? Love him or hate him, whats your take on Donald Trump? Sound off in the WND PollMr. Fleischer and other critics of Mr. Trump arent listening to the blaring trumpets of dissatisfaction that are blown by millions of Americans who realize that its the professional political punks in D.C. who have engineered the economic train wreck that is strangling the economy, shrinking the middle class and creating even further embarrassing, America-destroying dependence on Fedzilla by tens and tens of millions of Americans.Mr. Trump didnt create this economic swan dive to the street. Our politicians did, the very guys Mr. Fleischer apparently believes are the solution to the problem. If he actually believes this jabberwocky, Fleischer should seek political mental health disability.Donald Trump is running strong in the early polls because Americans are fed up with the political status quo, especially from left-leaning GOP Fedzillacrats who want to feed us cow dung while telling us its a cheeseburger.Our forefathers wouldnt recognize the political labyrinth our professional politicians have created. The very things our forefathers warned us not to do as it pertains to embracing a centralized, powerful federal government is the very cliff our professional politicians have steered the Goodship America straight off of. And Donald Trump is a mess?American doesnt need any more professional political punks in D.C., unless you believe sticking a red hot crowbar in your eye is an excellent treatment for cataracts.Its professional political punks who have created the puss-filled infected wound of fundamental transformation, not Donald Trump.They are the ones calling for a bigger bureaucratic shovel for the hole they have already dug, not Donald Trump.They are the ones who have lied to Americans or intentionally hidden the truth from us, not Donald Trump.Its professional politicians who are the enemy of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, not Donald Trump.Experience more of Ted Nugents no-holds-barred passion and patriotism in his books and WNDs Ted Nugent for President! bumper stickerDonald Trumps message sings to Americans because he doesnt play politically correct brain-dead games. He calls them like he sees them. Thats refreshing to millions of Americans who believe political correctness is a public cancer that has eroded free speech and everything else good about America.Those who condemn Donald Trump for refusing to use cowardly, politically correct words would be wise to remember the words of Harry Truman who said, Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear. Instead of being condemned and lampooned by the likes of Ari Fleischer and his ilk, Donald Trump should be given the Medal of Freedom for speaking his mind in such a bold, honest and straight-forward manner.If you want to watch a real political train wreck, witness a real mess in progress, you need look no further than the professional politicians who have borrowed and spent this country into oblivion. Trump that if you dare.Carry on, Mr. Trump. Unless you are taking flak, youre not over the target.And for the record, I dare anybody to show me one word from Trump that isnt accurate. What sort of denial gagged liar denies that our country is being invaded by drugrunners, murderers and rapists?

For more information, visit canada.ca/healthArchivedThis page has been archived on the Web.On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in Carter v. Canada . It ruled that section 14 and paragraph 241(b) of the Criminal Code are unconstitutional because they prohibit physicians from assisting in the consensual death of another person.Section 14 states that no person is entitled to give their consent to die, and that the criminal liability for causing the death of a person is not affected by that person giving their consent to die. Section 14 operates to prevent a person – charged with murder from claiming as a defence the fact that the other person consented to die. Murder is punishable by life in prison, with no parole eligibility for at least 10 years.Paragraph 241(b) states that anyone who aids someone to die by suicide, whether suicide is attempted or not, is guilty of a criminal offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years. Assistance can include providing someone the means of ending their life, such as a tool or a deadly drug, or information about other means of ending their life.The Supreme Court found that these criminal provisions had the effect of forcing some individuals to take their own lives prematurely, for fear that they would be incapable of doing so when they reached the point where suffering would be intolerable. These provisions were also found to be an infringement of the rights of competent adults who seek to make personal decisions about their health care as a result of a grievous and irremediable medical condition that causes them enduring and intolerable suffering. These terms were not defined in the Court’s decision.The Court found that the prohibition on assisted suicide is intended to protect vulnerable persons from being induced to die by suicide at a time of weakness. As a result, the Court found that the total ban on assisted dying was overbroad because it also applied to non-vulnerable people and prevented them from receiving the assistance of a willing physician.While the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that criminal law must permit some form of physician-assisted dying, it held that the task of crafting an appropriate response was one for Parliament. For instance, the Court stated that there was a need for a “carefully designed system imposing stringent limits”; to protect vulnerable individuals, and that such complex regulatory regimes are better created by Parliament than by the Courts, and it recognized Parliament’s ""difficult task"" of balancing the competing interests of those who would seek access to physician-assisted dying and of those who may be put at risk by its legalization.The Court suspended its declaration of invalidity for one year (to Feb 6, 2016) to give time for governments to respond. On January 15, 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada granted the Government of Canada an additional 4 months, or until June 6, 2016, to respond to the Supreme Court of Canada’s ruling in Carter v. Canada. At the same time, the Court also granted an exemption to those who wish to exercise their rights by allowing them to apply to the superior court of their jurisdiction for relief in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 127 of the Court’s reasons in Carter.Date modified:"	2016/08/02

However, evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism frequency does not support such an association.”2006September 26. In a statement prepared for the Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs, the FDA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the IOM in 2004 does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.

An April 3rd letter from a military contract officer laid out several complaints about the performance of Warrior Canine Connection, the group that trains veterans to train service dogs for their fellow disabled vets. WASHINGTON — An April 3rd letter from a military contract officer laid out several complaints about the performance of Warrior Canine Connection, the group that trains veterans to train service dogs for their fellow disabled vets. A letter sent to the firm managing the contract for Warrior Canine Connection complained about the “health and well-being of animals, specifically as it pertains to standard precautions in a health care setting”. According to the letter, there had been several instances when dogs who appeared to be sick, described as unable to control their bowels, were brought to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence. The contract states that animals with any sign of illness — from runny noses to diarrhea — could not be brought to the facility. The complaints also included concerns that the dogs suffering those signs of illness went untreated and that one dog had issues that “were allowed to persist for months.” Rick Yount, Executive Director of Warrior Canine Connection told WTOP Wednesday that there had been some concern about health issues among some dogs, but that a veterinarian was brought in and those issues were resolved. Related Stories Program that pairs service dogs with veterans booted from Fort Belvoir and Walter Reed Local News Other complaints in the letter related to the qualifications of trainers. According to the letter signed by Contracting Officer Martin Rios, “Several complaints showed that WCC was not and continues to not provide the required ‘trained professionals’” called for in the contract. According to the letter, “These complaints also show that individuals hired for certain positions on this contract, do not meet the qualifications written in the contract, and these qualifications were never pursued in order to obtain contract compliance.”Marvin Davis, of MD Consulting in Waldorf, Maryland, was the prime contractor for Warrior Canine Connection. He told WTOP that the issues in the April 3 letter “had been resolved” and that they were not the cause of the stop-work order that Warrior Canine Connection got on Oct. 27. Instead, Davis said, “Based on my communications with the government, the letter of concern was not the basis of the stop-work order.”Davis said he was told “The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center medical director wanted to go in a different direction as it related to the canine program at Walter Reed.”In an email statement on Thursday, Communications Director for Walter Reed Sandy Dean wrote to WTOP to say that the stop-work order was issued “so that we could restructure the contract to enhance oversight of patient care.” She added that canine-assisted therapy programming would continue at Walter Reed, but didn’t say whether that would include dogs from Warrior Canine Connection. Asked about the likelihood that Warrior Canine Connection would eventually return to work at Walter Reed and Fort Belvoir, Davis, the prime contractor for Warrior Canine Connection said, “I could not answer that question. I just don’t know.”Yount, the Executive Director at Warrior Canine Connection, told WTOP on Wednesday that no matter what happens with the contract, “We’re going to continue serving veterans with the dogs in this program. We can’t stop. We know it’s invaluable.”Matt Moores, a retired Marine who was both treated at Walter Reed and eventually went to work for Warrior Canine Connection before stepping down in August, shared the same concerns about trainers’ qualifications that were outlined in the April 3 letter. While critical of the management at the nonprofit, Moores also said he supports the mission of the organization. Moores said Warrior Canine Connection needs to be back at Fort Belvoir and Walter Reed. “But it needs to be done correctly. It needs to be led effectively. Not just for the patients, but for the staff who work so hard.”He added, “Our wounded soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors — they deserve to have these dogs.” Like WTOP on Facebook and follow @WTOP on Twitter to engage in conversation about this article and others. © 2017 WTOP.

Yount, the Executive Director at Warrior Canine Connection, told WTOP on Wednesday that no matter what happens with the contract, “We’re going to continue serving veterans with the dogs in this program. We can’t stop. Matt Moores, a retired Marine who was both treated at Walter Reed and eventually went to work for Warrior Canine Connection before stepping down in August, shared the same concerns about trainers’ qualifications that were outlined in the April 3 letter. While critical of the management at the nonprofit, Moores also said he supports the mission of the organization. Moores said Warrior Canine Connection needs to be back at Fort Belvoir and Walter Reed. “But it needs to be done correctly. It needs to be led effectively.

NBC even tweeted and deleted a tweet declaring her their Favorite president in 2020. I guess I get it now. Remember this 2014 interview where Oprah Winfrey said white people have to die? Oprah Winfrey is basically a carbon copy of Michael, err Michelle Obama. For awhile, Democrats were praying that Michelle Obama would run for POTUS. She has no desire to ever do that. She hated living in the White House for the eight years she already did. Why would she actually work to try and get back in there? Oprah Winfrey is already loved by the media just like the Obama family. The Golden Globes award should be renamed the Golden Coral award after all the slobbering of racist pig Oprah Winfrey. If this is the best that the Democrats can come up with for 2020, Trump will likely win 35 states.	2018/01/09

According to preliminary reports from the scene, which is closed off for more than a mile, 11 “very dangerous men” who aren’t supposed to be in America at all have been apprehended plotting what would have been our next 9-11.Agent Nesmith Variacles of the FBI explains:“We found more than 40 suicide vests that would have killed anyone in a 300 foot radius. That’s basically a football field. These bombs were high-tech, plastic and non-detectable. They could have blown up 40 malls, sports venues, buildings…whatever they wanted. The good news is, they were a week out and we caught them.”The mosque was actively recruiting American teenage Muslims to help carry out its plan to murder “as many as 100K infidels.” That number means either a mass attack spread across the country or a major sports venue going down with all 40 vests going off in tandem. The Department of Refugee Affairs seems to think it would have been the latter:“We believe they would have hit a football game next weekend, probably the Patriots in Foxboro. A liberal state is more likely to overlook a bunch of brown-skinned guys in overstuffed coats on a frigid Massachusetts night than they are to gove them a hard time.

According to reports, the bodies had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads of the corpses.The Chicago coroners office made a gruesome discovery today after several 911 calls were placed by neighbors regarding their concern of suspicious activity at the residence of Thompson. At approximately 8 p.m., police were dispatched to South Pulaski Road and West Lexington Street. Upon their arrival, their arrival, authorities were met by a group of residents at the corner where they assisted police in locating the home in question. Police proceeded to the 3000 Block of West Lexington Street where they located the home. Authorities knocked on the door of the residence and was met by an African-American male, who appeared to be in his late 30’s and seemed to be “under the influence of drugs”.Upon entering the home, authorities indicated that the home “smelled of death”. The power was off in the house however authorities found a gasoline powered generated running in the kitchen.“A Black male, approximately in his 30’s, opened the door with the smell of alcohol and marijuana on his body. He appeared to be somewhat disoriented and his speech was slurred. We asked him for permission to enter the premises, however he seems reluctant to allow us to enter,” said Lt. Kyle Jennings. “After a few seconds, he mumbled “yes” to us. Once we entered the home, we were met with a very foul odor as if something was dead in the home. The power was off so we used our flash lights to look around. As we approached the rear of the home, a light was on in the kitchen. We asked the occupant for his name. He identified himself and told us he lived with his grandmother. In the kitchen, we found several handsaws covered in blood. Mr. Thompson pushed one of the officers and ran downstairs through a half-opened door in the kitchen.”MUST READ: 7 Eleven Cashier Stabbed To Death Over Arizona Iced Tea Price IncreaseOne of the freezers found by police containing bodiesLt.

With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20’s. The heads that were found all had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive.

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/train-crash-claims-off-rails/	Train Crash Claims Are Off The Rails	false	[]	http://www.sltrib.com/	http://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2017/12/18/amtrak-train-derails-south-of-seattle/	2017/12/21	· Published: December 18, 2017Updated: December 19, 2017DuPont, Wash. • An Amtrak train making its inaugural trip on a new service from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, derailed near here early Monday while crossing an overpass, toppling cars onto one of the busiest highways on the West Coast, killing at least three people and injuring about 100.The wreck left 65-ton passenger rail cars scattered — several of them on the highway below, one tucked under the bridge it was to cross, others beside the railroad embankment and one dangling from the bridge with an end resting on the rail car that had been in front of it. In all, 13 of the train’s cars jumped the tracks, officials said.At least five vehicles passing below on Interstate 5 — including two tractor-trailers — were heavily damaged as the rail cars from Amtrak Cascades train 501 fell from above.Seconds later a member of the train crew radioed a dispatcher: “Amtrak 501, emergency, emergency, emergency. We’re on the ground. ... We were coming around the corner to take the bridge over I-5 there, right north in Nisqually, and we went on the ground.”The dispatcher asked, “Is everybody OK?”The crew member replied: “I’m still figuring that out. We got cars everywhere and down onto the highway.”He was one of five crew members aboard the train, along with 80 passengers, Amtrak said.A Washington State Police spokeswoman said three people had been confirmed dead and about 100 people were transported to hospitals, many of whom remain in critical condition. It was unclear whether everyone had been accounted for.“There are a lot of critical injuries,” spokeswoman Brooke Bova said. “This is a very complex scene.”Authorities said they do not know what caused the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending 20 of its investigators to the scene. They were expected to arrive late Monday.At a news conference at NTSB headquarters in Washington, D.C., board member Bella Dinh-Zarr had few details about the crash or potential causes but said agency officials would know more once their team arrived.Those investigators will include at least a dozen specialists in train operations, mechanics, tracks, signal systems, human performance and survival factors. The lead investigator is Ted Turpin, who also worked on the 2015 Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia and was the lead investigator for the Long Island Rail Road train crash at New York’s Atlantic Terminal early this year.A website that collects train location and speed information from Amtrak’s live map said the train was traveling at 81 mph as it neared the curve. Trains are supposed to reduce their speed to 30 mph to negotiate the curve, according to Rachelle Cunningham, a spokeswoman at Sound Transit, which owns the tracks.Dinh-Zarr said that speed is one of the first factors that NTSB investigators will be looking at. They will also be assessing what crash-avoidance technology existed on the tracks or on the train and whether that technology functioned properly.Though Amtrak trains are equipped with it, the railroad said the train was not using positive train control, a system that would have slowed it as it entered the curve. The system requires that sensors also be placed along the rail bed, and those were not scheduled to be in place until sometime next year, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation.The Amtrak Cascades train has daily service between Seattle and Portland, with the first run departing Seattle at 6 a.m. DuPont is about 50 miles south of Seattle; the crash happened between the Tacoma and Olympia rail stops, shortly after 7:30 a.m.Chris Karnes, a passenger, said the train was approaching a curve at a high speed before it came off the tracks.“It seemed like we were reaching sort of a bend in the tracks and all of a sudden we were slammed into the seats in front of us,” Karnes told CBS News. “And then the car careened down an embankment and came to a stop. After that happened we could hear and feel the cars crumpling and breaking apart.”Karnes, who was in a car toward the front of the train, said he and other passengers had to kick out a window to escape. Passengers had visible injuries — “cuts, people bleeding,” he said. “I did see one person who was laying on the ground and not moving.”Daniel Konzelman was driving on I-5 when he and a friend saw the jumble of derailed cars. The emergency response training he acquired during his Eagle Scout days kicked in, and Konzelman, 24, immediately pulled over, according to the Associated Press.He and his friend climbed into train cars to look for victims. Some were pinned under the train; others appeared to be dead. Konzelman helped the passengers who looked as if they could move out of the train and tried to comfort those who appeared to be seriously injured. He and his friend stayed for almost two hours.“I wasn’t scared. I knew what to expect,” Konzelman said, adding: “I prepared for the worst and hoped for the best. I saw a little bit of both.”Danae Orlob, 27, of Olympia was in the back seat of a car that passed under the bridge moments after the derailment and before authorities arrived.“What I originally thought was a semi was actually a train car just flattened on the ground,” said Orlob, who was on her way to work in Bellevue, east of Seattle. “The train cars were on both sides of the bridge, which I can’t even imagine how that would have happened.”She said there was a stillness in the moments after the crash, as if everyone was stunned.“It was quiet. It was weird and made me think the accident had been there much longer than it had,” she said. “It was definitely surreal.”She looked back and saw a single rail car dangling over the highway from the bridge.“It looked mostly intact, so the best thing I could hope was, I hoped everybody could have gotten out of there okay,” she said.Within a minute, she said, a police car arrived. Then a wave of first responders, ambulances, firetrucks and other emergency vehicles poured onto the highway.The Amtrak train was on its first run on tracks that had been rebuilt at a cost of $181 million, using a 14.5-mile bypass owned by the regional transit authority and avoiding a more scenic but slower passage along the coastline. Officials celebrated the opening of the Tacoma station along the rebuilt route with a ribbon cutting Friday.The new Amtrak Cascades service is part of an expansion of Amtrak intercity passenger rail service that includes station upgrades and expansions and the addition of new locomotives.Though the train had been tested on the track, Monday’s run was the first time it made the trip with a load of about 80 passengers and their baggage.Washington and Oregon jointly operate the Amtrak Cascades intercity passenger service. The trains share the tracks with freight trains and are authorized to travel at top speeds of 79 mph, according to information from the Washington State Department of Transportation.The new service is said to save 10 minutes in travel time between Seattle to Portland.“On behalf of everyone at Amtrak, we are deeply saddened by all that has happened today,” Amtrak president and co-chief executive Richard Anderson said in a statement Monday. “We will do everything in our power to support our passengers and crew and their families.”At an afternoon news conference, Gay Banks Olson, assistant superintendent at Amtrak, said the railroad’s first priority is to take care of passengers, employees and relatives affected.“It is horrible that this happened to these passengers, but we are very grateful that there weren’t more people involved,” Banks Olson said. “We are going to do everything we can in the next few days and weeks to support these passengers and their families.”State police are providing resources and getting supplies to the scene, the spokeswoman said.Gov. Jay Inslee, D, said on Twitter: “Today’s tragic incident in Pierce County is a serious and ongoing emergency. Trudi and I are holding in our hearts everyone on board, and are praying for the many injured.”Rescue crews had to use chain saws, hydraulic equipment, air chisels and various other tools to extricate victims.Jay Sumerland, battalion chief with West Pierce Fire and Rescue, described the scene as surreal.“When there are cars dangling over the freeway, it’s very precarious and dangerous to the fire service crews,” he said. “Firefighters put themselves in a very dangerous place and did a great job searching all over those cars.”The power car behind the locomotive carried 350 gallons of fuel. The Washington State Department of Ecology and Amtrak were working on mitigation.Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste said his agency performed an initial investigation in anticipation of NTSB’s arrival.Cranes also were being brought in to stabilize the cars before state transportation officials could inspect the bridge.Officials said the recovery and investigation may stretch into morning commute hours and advised commuters to make alternative plans or telecommute.---Tollefson contributed to this report from DuPont, Washington.

It means that more than 4 million votes cast for Democrats in traditionally red counties will go in the trash bin, turning the tide of victory back to the true conservatives who backed Donald Trump.In the end, 17 elections involving ballot referendums for free entitlements for immigrants, legalized marijuana and decriminalizing heroin overdoses should be overturned. The last one, in particular, is important to the free-loading left, because they believe they should just be able to get high and lose control without any repercussions when they wake up after costing the taxpayer a ride to the hospital and a shot of Narcan.Court cases have now been filed to de-certify those elections and either switch the results or call for a new, fair election. The company that makes the machines, Novus Ordo Seclorum, INC, says the issue was an “unforeseen software glitch” and that the original votes can still be recovered.Sorry, globalists.

But Marquesha Johnson isn’t the woman the mainstream media said, and those donations only helped raise one black up: herself.According to a class action lawsuit filed Wednesday, Johnson “solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself.”The documents filed Tuesday claim that Johnson bought herself a $1.2 million home as well as a Range rover and “other exorbitancies” rather than use her ill-gotten gains to help people.Unfortunately, it’s likely that what she did was perfectly legal because she solicited the funds through a GoFundMe campaign and the company is notoriously bad at working with police to crack down on scammers.Johnson was questioned by police, but denies misusing funds. She refuses to hand over records.As Johnson enjoys her money, blacks across America continue to suffer poverty, gang culture, and more.I hope she’s pleased with herself.About William ""Truthteller"" Farrow 86 ArticlesWilliam Farrow is a conservative Christian who serves God as the leader of a flock in Arkansas.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/pluto-not-reclassified-planet/	Pluto Not Reclassified as a Planet	false	['pluto', 'space']	http://web.archive.org/	http://web.archive.org/web/20180202232909/http://www.untold-universe.org/2017/09/pluto-has-been-officially-reclassified.html	2018/02/07	Pluto Has Been Officially Reclassified As A Planet!08:21TwitterToday is a historic day—one that will bring joy to the hundreds of millions of Pluto lovers around the globe. The International Astronomical Union (IAU), the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos, has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet. That’s right, the little dwarf will be rejoining the ranks of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Planet-X (the planet that will surely spell doom for all humanity).As many of you know, in 2006, the IAU made their infamousvote, deciding to demote everyone’s favorite planet to a “dwarf planet.” Their reasoning was that too many people would confuse Pluto (the doggy of Disney fame) with Pluto (the planet, of space and stuff). Immediately after this 2006 announcement, the public exploded with outrage. There were a number of campaigns launched that were aimed at ensuring that Pluto was reinstated as a planet. These met with no success. Pluto was officially classified as a dwarf planet.But all of that just changed, After years of deliberation, the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy world—they upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. “We simply underestimated the public’s attachment to Pluto.We realized our error shortly after the decision came down to demote it,” said Dr. Amy Joggy, professor at the Institute of Planetary Studies and head of the IAU’s Planetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force. “We didn’t think anyone would really care if a little clump of ice and rock on the outskirts of the solar system was reclassified. Clearly, we dun messed up, and that makes me super sad face.Today, we take steps to correct this most grievous of errors.In addition to Pluto’s reclassification, Dr. Joggy has also proposed that the IAU create a new category of planet called a “hyper-planet.” These hyper-planets, according to Dr. Joggy, are like regular planets but at least two times as awesome (thanks to the fancy, fancy name).It has also been proposed that Pluto be made an honorary member of this new planetary class. “In all honesty, we feel bad for the way we treated Pluto and, more importantly, all those that cared about it so greatly- the public showed us our error. Hopefully, the new class of planet will be created without a hitch, and Pluto will be added as the first member. It’s only fair.”Say it with me now, “Yay!”

And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,"" Tomlin and Fonda declared to the audience, a clear jab at the president. Parton, who did not join in the Trump-bashing, said on ""Fox & Friends"" today that she views herself as an entertainer and doesn't like to mix in her political opinions. She pointed out that many of her fans actually criticized her for not speaking up in defense of Trump at that moment. ""I didn't know what to say. I'll always just go to a boob joke if all else fails,"" she joked.Parton said she was ""nervous"" beforehand knowing Fonda and Tomlin planned to address Trump, but decided it was best to stay out of it.

Just Islam.This petition demands that the U.S. Department of Education dump its ""Access Islam"" program and acknowledge that it is a violation of the U.S. Constitution.The program, written for Grades 5 - 12, has students learning verses from the Quran and Hadith.

Instead, motorists are driving on President Barack Obama Highway. Riviera Beach officials renamed the portion of the highway in their city limits, and the new sign carrying the name of the nation’s first black president went up Thursday. Old Dixie, officials said, paid homage to an era that glorified slavery. The name was “symbolic of racism, symbolic of the Klan, symbolic of cross burnings, and today we are stepping up to a new day, a new era,” Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters told WPTV on Thursday. The street itself carried a painful history for some. Dora Johnson, 77, told the television station that she once witnessed a cross-burning on Old Dixie Highway. Johnson will be given the old sign that has been removed, Masters told the Palm Beach Post. The city council’s August vote to rename Old Dixie came at a time when many communities in the South were reconsidering Confederate flags and monuments. A national debate over such symbols began anew following the June shooting of nine parishioners by a white gunman inside a historic black church in South Carolina. “Dixie” has become synonymous with the antebellum south, slavery and the states that seceded from the Union. The song “Dixie,” dubbed the anthem of the Confederacy, became popularized through minstrel shows with actors in blackface. The Dixie Highway system was born in the early 1900s out of a desire to connect people further north to Florida, and the road snaked from the Midwest to the South. Residents in Riviera Beach, which is nearly 70 percent black, spoke out in August in favor of the change, and cheered as the sign came down Thursday, the Sun Sentinel reported. “I love where I’m from,” resident Kendra Williams said during the August debate over the name change. “I love the South. But I do not love Dixie. President Barack Obama Highway now intersects with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.	2015/12/19

The alleged victims of the Sandy Hook shooting are alive and well. The entire event was a hoax. It was designed to go after people's emotional vulnerability. It happened right before Christmas and it involved young children. The New World Order wants to disarm the American people. That's why they created all of these hoax shootings. Every disarmament by the government is followed by a genocide of the citizens. This happened with the Bolsheviks in Russia. This also happened in China, Vietnam, and Nazi Germany. Once the citizens are disarmed they are helpless sheep. Europe has already been disarmed now their coming for Americans guns. Don't give up your guns. After each one of these fake shootings go buy another gun. Obama was the best gun salesman in history. These fake shootings go back to Columbine High School, Sandy Hook, and Aurora movie theater shooting. The Dylann Roof church shooting was fake. The Pulse Nightclub was fake. The Texas church shooting was fake. The Las Vegas shooting was fake. The most recent school shooting in Florida was fake. I may have forgot some of them. But you get the point these were all done by our own government with the intention of taking away our 2nd Amendment rights. This information needs to be revealed to all of the American people. A lot of us already know but it hasn't reached critical mass yet.This is the crisis actor David wheeler. He played two roles in this hoax. Here he is as the grieving father of Ben Wheeler.Here he is with his sniper rifle and his AR-15 playing an FBI agent.This is him carrying his AR-15 pointed backwards while holding it from the magazine! This is a dangerous and stupid way to carry a rifle. Any firearms owner with a brain would never do this! A trained FBI agent would be fired for handling a weapon this carelessly.You still don't believe me. Here's a picture of Adam Lanza. He played another crisis actor role as the brother of Christina Grimmie the winner of The Voice. Her name is also a mockery of Jesus Christ. Christina is the female version for Christ. And her last name grimy meaning filthy! I find this the most offencive slap in the face to Christians.Look closely at both of their hands. They are doing a Freemason hand sign. The two middle fingers together and the other fingers spread apart making an ( M ) with their fingers. They do this in their hoax is to mock us.A lot of people don't know Hitler was a Freemason.Here's a picture of the Pope doing a Freemason hand sign, and the one eye symbol of Lucifer.Mark 4:22 There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light.Romans 3:4 Let God be true and every man a liar! God bless	2018/02/17

Thanks to an error in the paperwork, Obama was able to walk free.But the story doesn’t end there.At around 7 p.m., local news stations began reporting on the death of a man named Patrick Farley. Patrick Farley is the name of the arresting officer who handled Malia Obama, and according to his wife on Facebook these two Patrick Farleys are one and the same.Farley, a man who reputedly has almost perfect health, reportedly died in his bed of a “heart attack.”Not a single news report to date has mentioned that he was a police officer or that he was the one who cuffed Malia Obama after she and her hate group attacked a defenseless old lady.Let’s get this straight: Malia Obama was arrested committing a violent hate crime. An error in the paperwork allowed her to walk free. Now the arresting officer is dead under pretty suspicious circumstances?

Once the grace period ends, adults who smoke in a vehicle where a child is will be fined $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second and $150 for a third offense.Polimeni reiterated that the point of the law is to try to change behavior, not to collect on fines.------SCHENECTADY -- Lighting up in your car could soon be against the law, if you’re driving with a child.Councilman John Polimeni wants to fine anyone who's caught smoking in cars with kids.""I saw a car with little kids in the back, and in fact, one was a baby. And i said this can't possibly be good for their respiratory function,” Polimeni exclaimed.Here's how the local law would work: smoking would be illegal anytime there's a kid under 16 years old in the car.That goes for cigarettes, e-cigs, cigars, or any type of smoking for that matter—not just tobacco.If you're seen with any of those in your mouth, police will presume you're breaking the law and slap you with a $50 fine, unless you can prove otherwise.""We're not looking for fine money. We're not looking for that at all.

Rockland County also has a similar ban on the books.The City Council plans to vote on the issue Monday night at 7:00PM.Information from New York Department of Health:New York is a leader in tobacco control policy development and implementation, with many strong and effective tobacco control policies in place at the state and local levels.

That order, from Judge Sanford Batt of the West Texas Federal Probate Court, states that Obama and his family will forfeit their assets and future earnings as well as gifts and presidential pensions until the $400 million he handed to Iranian hardliners is paid back:“That money was given to terrorists without the taxpayers’ approval and without Congressional approval. The court hereby declares it a personal debt and orders the defendant and/or his family and estate to pay the debt owed to America.”What that means is that Obama will give up $160 million he and his wife scammed in book deals as well as the $104 million they’ve made speaking to refugee camps overseas. The rest of the debt will come from their pension unless someone like George Soros steps in and pays his debt for him.Obama and his lawyers argued that a decision made in the interests of national security can’t be directed at the man but rather the office:“This is f*cking ridiculous.”That was really all he needed to say.

These lines werent from the film he was working on as Jack Traven, the SWAT officer who takes control of a bomb-laden bus, Reeves didnt have a great deal to say but from William Shakespeares Hamlet, a well-thumbed copy of which he would carry around on set.His day job was zooming through Los Angeles with a flustered Sandra Bullock and a coachload of screaming extras. Monologuing as the tragic Prince of Denmark, on the other hand, was me-time.I finished playing Jack, went into the trailer, and, you know How all occasions do inform against me,/ And spur my dull revenge, he says, reeling off the opening few lines of Hamlets last soliloquy. Did it help him cope with what was, at that point, his most commercially prominent role to date? Hum. He pauses. I dont know. There was definitely a yin and yang thing going on.As he continues, what soon becomes clear is that those snatched moments of Shakespeare helped Reeves make sense not so much of Traven or Hamlet, but of himself. He was 29 years old at the time, with a career that was skyrocketing. But Reeves didnt see himself as an action hero or not just an action hero, at least.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...Related1.4kSHARESShareTweet	2018/03/06

It starred the then-closeted tennis great Billie Jean King in a match with Bobby Riggs, a retired player some 26 years her senior who was adamant he could beat any woman who stepped onto the court. “Women belong in the bedroom and kitchen, in that order,” he once claimed, encapsulating the rampant misogyny of the era. (He was also a showman, and today King talks of him fondly as one of her heroes.) \Related | Gallery: Battle of the Sexes Stars Emma Stone & Andrea RiseboroughWhether Riggs was playing it for laughs or not, the stakes were very real in 1973—the year the Supreme Court affirmed the right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. King herself feared that using a tennis match to champion the cause of equality would turn into a circus, and only agreed to play Riggs after he trounced Margaret Court, then the women’s number 1 player, 6-2, 6-1, in what was nicknamed the Mother’s Day Massacre. King, who scored a major coup that year by threatening to boycott the U.S. Open over pay disparity (resulting in the tournament becoming the first to award equal prize money to men and women), felt compelled to make up for Court’s dismal showing. On the day, Riggs arrived in the arena on a rickshaw pulled by five scantily clad women as an 80-piece band played “Jesus Christ Superstar.” King entered, Cleopatra-style, on a gold throne borne aloft by four bare-chested men. Riseborough: Dress by Bonnie Young, Stone: Top & pants by Tom Ford, Earrings by Jennifer Fisher With 90 million people watching worldwide, King prevailed in three sets (6-4, 6-3, 6-3), and the match became a cornerstone of second-wave feminism, putting sports at the heart of a national conversation around gender equality. But off-court King was waging another battle, trying to balance her public persona as a happily married woman with her attraction to women. In their new movie, Battle of the Sexes (opening September 22), filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, best known for Little Miss Sunshine, use the match as a backdrop to explore King’s internal conflict, portraying her relationship with her hairdresser Marilyn Barnett—later responsible for outing King in 1981—in a series of generous and tender scenes. Here, Billie Jean King talks with Emma Stone, who plays her in the film, and Andrea Riseborough, who stars as Marilyn, about turning life into art, teaching girls to be ambitious, and why the issues of 1973 are just as vital and resonant today. Billie Jean King: I thought it was very wise to choose Val and Jonathan to direct Battle of the Sexes, because this movie is for everyone. It isn’t just for women, and it isn’t just for men. It shows how vulnerable people are, and how life is messy and yet joyful. Simon [Beaufoy, the writer] is the one I spent the most time with, and then Emma and I met in January last year. We went out on the court a couple of days to play. Didn’t you say you gained 15 pounds and were working out like a fiend? Emma Stone: Yeah, it was like six days a week. I was really going for it. You know, I see old pictures of you, and you’re so muscular and sinewy, and I’m like, ugh. Your body was so iconic, and all I wanted was to just match that exactly. You know, my tennis double was such an imperative part of the movie—me being a novice, and Billie Jean being number 1 in the world [laughs]—so thankfully our bodies matched enough that I was like, OK, we’ve got a happy medium here—it’s about the essence of Billie Jean and her heart and her spirit.But god, what I wouldn’t give to have those same muscles. You have no idea. BJK: Really? I’m always trying to lose weight. Top & Pants: Tom FordAndrea Riseborough: Emma, we hadn’t seen each other for six months or longer, and when I came to the set, I was like, Emma has eaten another person. You were ripped. ES: Thanks, buddy. When I first met Billie Jean, the great thing was that she’s such a coach and she knows sports psychology, and she instantly reduced it to playing catch. So I got to feel like a golden retriever running after a ball, and just making sure the ball was in front of my face. What was incredible, and I guess it’s in every great coach or athlete, is that she found my strengths and she played to those. She found out instantly that I like to dance and I could move my feet, and that was our jumping-off point. AR: Watching all of the women we had playing tennis in the movie was so inspiring. I think it’s the only dynamic in which I would be comfortable playing a cheerleader, and Marilyn [Billie Jean King’s girlfriend at the time] was in that situation. She was so invested in Billie Jean emotionally and so supportive. I have no interest in playing a heterosexual cheerleader to a wonderful football player in a movie—that’s the last thing I want to do with my life—but there was a real sense of pride when we were shooting that final match. It was euphoric watching it. You got a taste of what Marilyn must have felt. It’s like watching stallions moving around—so captivating. ES: The responsibility I felt to Billie Jean is immense. She relieved me when she came to the set and said, “You’re never going to disappoint me. You’re never going to let me down,” She could tell that I cared so much. But I also had to keep some semblance of distance, because I was watching so many tapes of her at 29 and 30 and 32, and she’s so fully formed now and has the benefit of all this hindsight. She sent me some beautiful text messages about the pain she was in, or that it was messy, and I knew that was the place that I had to find for her in that period—her strength of spirit is unlike that of anyone I’ve ever met, but there was also this confusion and this pain and things I could really relate to. I’m lucky enough to be at that age right now, and I know all of those stirrings and those feelings in me. I can’t understand being the number 1 tennis player in the world. I don’t know what it’s like to be a hero to millions in that way. But I do know what it’s like to struggle and to be afraid and to be a public person, and to feel like you can’t share all of yourself, and to be afraid of saying the wrong thing, or not furthering goodness in the world. And somehow fucking it up. AR: It’s easy to describe it as just resilience, but actually it’s so much more than that. For me, the easiest part of the story was the love story because there was such ease. It was full of hope and joy. I felt like the embodiment of joy in the piece, the freedom and liberation, and that is very different for me, in my own life, to play. It felt fantastic and sensational to play someone who had such a free and captivating spirit as Marilyn. I’ve never cut hair, I’m not a hairdresser, I did not train six days a week to cut hair—but the part of the story of them falling in love was very pure and easy. ES: Easy for you! BJK: It wasn’t easy for me, so Emma, that’s perfect. I had a hard time watching the film, to be honest—it reconnected me to those times. Ilana [Kloss, King’s partner] has watched it six times, and every time she watches it she says it’s better than the last time. I think the film helped me stop for a few moments—because I’m always going through life pretty fast— and to really appreciate what we did back then. I was listening to an interview with Roger Federer, and he said how much he loves having his balanced life, people to take care of him, his schedule. He kept talking about the ATP [Association of Tennis Professionals] tour and the majors, and I thought, That’s great, Roger, but we didn’t have that opportunity. We were up day and night, trying to promote, trying to organize, trying to create an infrastructure so we could have a tour. I wanted the men and women to be together [in the same association], and they didn’t want us to be together. I thought that was a huge mistake, and I still think it’s a huge mistake. So we had to do it ourselves, and in some ways that allowed us to have more confidence, to understand how to market ourselves better, to go out and help create an infrastructure.Jacket & Skirt: Jean Paul Gaultier, Shoes: Stella LunaES: It’s always going to be difficult to watch myself as you—I have a hundred ideas of things that I should have done differently—but I was so happy with the way it came together. There’s such a great message about not having to do everything right. You don’t have to know who you are completely in order to still effectively help change the world. I’ve always felt that if I get to a certain point I’m going to know all these things about myself, and then I’ll be able to speak, or be of service in some way. You know, I’m afraid in a way that I don’t know that Billie Jean naturally is. I’m afraid of my voice sometimes.BJK: I’m afraid a lot. I’m scared, and I’ve felt lonely. When you’re a leader, it’s a very lonely place sometimes. Watching this movie was terrifying for me. This is a slice of 1973 and what was going on in my life and other people’s lives. I just really hope it touches the hearts and minds of people and gives them a glimpse of the early ’70s and the challenges, especially for the LGBTQ community. And with Margaret Court recently coming out [against lesbian players], this feels very timely. I just hope it helps somebody out there who is struggling. But most important to me, I hope this film will tell people to be their authentic selves—just find your journey, find how to get there. It took me until I was 51, and I would love to be a lot younger and to have gotten where I needed to go. ES: The parallels in this movie are pretty fascinating. We began shooting in the spring of 2016, when there was still a lot of hope in the air, and it was very interesting to see this guy—this narcissistic, self-focused, constantly-stirring-the-pot kind of guy—against this incredible, qualified woman, and at the same time be playing Billie Jean, with Steve [Carell] playing Bobby Riggs. Obviously the way this has all panned out has been fascinating and horrifying, and it still feels like we’re in a bad dream, but those parallels make sense to me—the equal-pay issue makes a lot of sense to me. At our best right right now we’re making 80 cents to the dollar.BJK: In Hollywood? ES: It’s a difficult system because it depends on the kinds of films you’re a part of, the size of your role, how much the movies make at the box office. And so much of that changes your pay throughout your career, so I go more to the blanket issue that women, in general, are making four fifths at best. BJK: White women. If you’re African American or Hispanic it goes down, and then Asian Americans make 90 cents to the dollar. Top & Pants: Tom Ford, Shoes: Pierre Hardy, Rings: David Yurman & Tiffany & Co. AR: Hollywood works on quotes, so if somebody’s going to pay a huge actor $52 million to be in a movie or a franchise, he’s going to have a higher quote than anyone else. There are maybe one or two women that have a quote that’s as high as a guy’s, because most films are about white males.ES: Very true. In my career so far, I’ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut so that I may have parity with them. And that’s something they do for me because they feel it’s what’s right and fair. That’s something that’s also not discussed, necessarily—that our getting equal pay is going to require people to selflessly say, “That’s what’s fair.” If my male co-star, who has a higher quote than me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life. And this is Billie Jean’s feminism, and I love it—she is equality, man: equality, equality, equality. BJK: And inclusion. ES: It’s not about, “Women are this and men are that.” It is, “We are all the same, we are all equal, we all deserve the same respect and the same rights.” And that’s really what I’ve been so grateful for with male co-stars—when I’ve been in a similar-size role in films, and it’s been multiple people who have been really incredible and said, “That’s what I want to do. That’s what’s fair and what’s right.”BJK: You just gave an example of why men are so vital to these changes—because they’re usually in the power position, and if they start to change the paradigms, things start to shift. And that’s why I always include men in everything that I do. I mean, I’ve been doing teen tennis for 42 years, it’s a pro league, and we have an equal number of men and women on each team. So when a child comes out to watch, he or she is going to be socialized differently. The first generation of women that might have a chance to have equality as far as equal pay for equal work is probably those young people graduating right now from college or university, especially if they’re willing to follow the money. Girls tend to do not-for-profit work. We’re used to being very supportive. That’s what we’re taught, but women have to start stepping up. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. As long as you’re a good person and you don’t hurt others, ambition is really important. AR: And being fairly compensated financially for something that you work hard at is absolutely acceptable. I don’t know how many films I’ve been in—20, 25 films, something like that. And I’ve never had the experience of a guy taking any sort of pay cut. In fact, I’ve been number 1 in films before and been paid a lot less. BJK: Let me ask the real important question: Did you ask for a raise?AR: Oh, yes, I did. But there’s this underlying feeling that you should be grateful.BJK: Oh, yeah, we’re supposed to be happy with the crumbs. I talk about that in my speeches—that women deserve the cake, the icing, and the cherry on top as well, just like the men. So let’s go for it. But you also have to ask for what you want and need even if you get turned down. You have to figure out a way to ask.AR: I did it six weeks ago, to no avail. You know, so many times, so many times. It’s difficult. BJK: Was it in England or the States? AR: It’s everywhere, but much, much worse in the States. BJK: Worse in the States?Dress: Valentino, Shoes: Sergio RossiAR: Much, much worse, yeah. I’m sure there are a lot of people who think I’m a pain in the ass most of the time, but it gets very tiring. It’s tiring to speak up, to get up every day and to have that very specific experience of being patronized in a taxi cab, you know, or whatever the fuck it is, as a woman. BJK: You’re right. I’ve always felt like I’ve been on a tightrope. My whole life. And Emma just expressed a lot of the feelings that women have dealt with forever. I never want to network by gender, but my whole life has been watching men sticking up for each other and helping each other out, and women haven’t been socialized the same way. That’s why I like women to play sports. I don’t care if they’re any good, but at least they’ve learned the culture of men and how to help navigate through those difficult situations sometimes. AR: I wish you were my sports teacher growing up, Billie Jean. Bloody hell. BJK: I was actually outed in ’81, so it was later [than the Battle of the Sexes], but it was devastating. I had to start my life over. I lost endorsements. I lost everything, basically, overnight. You can’t believe the letters I got, how horrible they were. I should’ve kept them. I just couldn’t even stand looking at them. Sports are going to be the last bastion, especially in the men’s game. It’s got to be someone of really high stature, really up there. Andy Murray is such a feminist. I just love that guy. He’s the greatest. AR: I think we have to be real about the fact that we’re in 2017 and everyone’s so excited that we put out a superhero movie starring a woman.BJK: I know, it’s like, really? AR: Sometimes I feel like we have a long way to go. Women are seriously, highly sexualized. Just look at the Baywatch posters. It’s disgusting and degrading, and it’s pulling female emancipation kicking and screaming back 500 years. It is so important to think about what happened before, and there was a lot of strength before. Cleopatra was quite a long time ago, but Hillary didn’t get in. There’s a journey here, and it’s about, as Billie says, uniting. ES: Billie was describing her generation as the transition generation and the shoulders she stood on. What a beautiful thing: to connect younger people to something their parents or grandparents watched and were inspired by. My mom watched Billie's match with Bobby and got to talk to me about it. BJK: Your mom watched it? I didn’t know that. ES: Everybody watched it, are you kidding? AR: I didn’t grow up knowing about the Battle of the Sexes, or Billie Jean King—I was born after the events—but there are so many really important moments in terms of paving the way for legislation for equal pay that are overlooked, and this is one of them.ES: That’s what Billie Jean has always fought for. She’s never wavered on it, and it’s so beautiful to tie generations together in that way through this story. It’s just a real gift to be a part of it, and I'm so grateful to put a story like that out into the world.

And that equals grounds for impeachment or not.”“But I do believe this: we have to make sure the president knows what he’s talking about. And that’s why I say an intervention. What are the facts?”Recalling the first meeting that House and Senate leaders had with Trump following the inauguration, Pelosi says she wondered what words the commander in chief might utter during the “historic” gathering.ADVERTISEMENT “What is he going to say? Will he quote the Bible? Will he quote our founders? What poetry might he talk about in order to talk about the momentous nature of the occasion? And what’d he say? ‘You know I won the popular vote.’ ” “To which I said: That’s not true,” Pelosi recounted to Handler. “I always am respectful of the office,” Pelosi added, “But if he wasn’t going to be respectful — starting off with that — he opened the door.”“He said, ‘I won the popular vote because 3-5 million people did not vote legally in the election,” Pelosi exclaimed. “And that’s when I said that’s not true. There’s no evidence, no basis in fact.” “And then he said, ‘And I’m not even counting California!’ ” Pelosi said she replied to Trump: “We’ll have our disagreements over priorities, or the course of action, or the timing, but we have to stipulate a set of facts.” Saying Trump’s election “galvanized” her, Handler announced Wednesday that she’s not returning to Netflix for another season of her talk show, instead devoting her time to political organizing and activism.	2017/10/19

Were able to put in an artistic touch and were able to build, too.Although MCM is owned by five brothers, the top rung of the company is largely female, including several female construction workers. In contrast to Floress statement about prettiness, other engineers might argue that an artistic touch is less important than, say, making sure your structure doesnt collapse and kill people. Fox News reports that both MCM and Figgs, the companies in charge of constructing the bridge, have a record of failures and fines and there is now an accusation that MCM hired incompetent, inexperienced, unskilled or careless employees.The exact cause of the bridge failure is currently under investigation. Floress building philosophy and recent findings about the companies track records may give insight into the deadly collapse. feature image via Palm Beach PostDillon Knight is a student at Central Michigan University and covers Second Amendment issues for DANGEROUS.

It seems that no matter what liberals say, he might be right.In a shocking development, FBI officials raided former President Barack Obama’s $8.9 million dollar mansion in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington D.C. early Tuesday morning.According to sources within the agency, the raid was related to “a cabal of Obama administration officials” who actively worked to use the power of the United States government to undermine Trump “during the 2016 presidential campaign and after.”Officials removed 36 desktop computers, multiple removable storage drives, 12 laptops, and “multiple pieces of recording and surveillance equipment” as well as “thousands of pounds of paper documents” from Obama’s home.The former President has not yet been arrested, but FBI spokeswoman Shelly Smithers says “arrests are possible.”Obama moved into his D.C. home at the beginning of the year, followed by his partner-in-crime Valerie Jarrett in March . At the time it was speculated that the home would be used as a base of anti-Trump operations. Now, it seems, that is confirmed.The FBI says that a statement can be expected on Friday.About William ""Truthteller"" Farrow 87 ArticlesWilliam Farrow is a conservative Christian who serves God as the leader of a flock in Arkansas.

We won, but since the system is f***ed up, we lost. I thought, ‘alright. I took in my lesson on this one.” Cyrus stated.She had this to say about Trump fans: “Be that as it may, don’t Trump supporters like the way they think? So I’ve additionally got the chance to open up to the way I approach individuals with my conclusions. That is the best way to roll out genuine improvement.”Last March, Cyrus, promised to leave the United States if Donald Trump won the election. “Truly f*** this crap I am moving if this is my leader!” Cyrus posted on Instagram. Months after the fact, she called Sanders fans who declined to vote in favor of Clinton “f***ing insane.”However then she changed her mind and stayed. In the meeting with Billboard, Cyrus reacted to critics who asked her why she didn’t fulfil her promise to move out of the country: “It’s not time for me to leave now, man. I must be here.

Miley stated that she’s battling for “equality” and “justice” not “hate” and “walls.” However she is not satisfied about her current career status and she is blaming Trump supporters for that. She is not one of the top-selling artists anymore and she is convinced that Trump fans have something to do with that.She stated: “I’m sure that they have something to do with this. The amount of hate that I receive is unbelievable. If this continues I’m gonna leave the US and go to Australia or wherever. I swear. At least while Trump is here.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/muslim-nurses-not-exempt-from-hand-washing/	Muslim Nurses Not Exempt From Hand Washing	false	['International', 'anti-Muslim', 'false stories']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180419192521/http://www.hardcoreusanews.com/2018/03/12/muslim-nurses-refuse-to-wash-hands-before-operations-the-reason-why-is-insane/	2018/04/20	admin 5 CommentsMuslim nurses in the UK have now been granted the option of participating in medical operations without washing their hands. If this gives you the willies and makes you feel a bit icky inside, it should. Washing hands is a basic tenet of good hygiene and helps prevent the spread of diseases and infections, especially to those most susceptible to them, such as individuals receiving an operation. Check out the reason given by these nurses to justify this insanity.The demand first derived from Islamic Sharia Law. Muslim nurses feared that washing their hands in the operating room, “compromises their modesty.” Of course, medical experts argued that not practicing proper sanitation before a procedure compromises the safety of patients instead.Still, Muslim nurses now have the option to wear disposable plastic over-sleeves, rather than scrubbing their hands. The Department of Health in the UK addressed concerns about the solution by stating that “the guidance is intended to balance infection control measures with cultural beliefs.” So it’s true. Sharia law is actually hazardous to your health. Wonder if it would be possible to get a Surgeon General’s warning slapped on every Koran sold in the U.S.?While UK medical officials are taking a few steps to limit the nurse’s exposure to patients, this is still gross and shouldn’t be allowed. If washing their hands in public violates their religion, they have the freedom to pursue a different career path.To allow this type of egregious neglect of basic hygiene puts people unnecessarily at risk for developing an infection. Hopefully common sense will prevail and this allowance will be overturned. One more reason to be thankful we don’t have a healthcare system like Britain’s.

Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, has pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws and has implicated Mr. Trump. Here is how their relationship has evolved.Published OnApril 11, 2018By Michael D. Shear , Matt Apuzzo and Sharon LaFraniereApril 10, 2018WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. agents who raided the office of President Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday were looking for records about payments to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr. Trump as well as information related to the role of the publisher of The National Enquirer in silencing one of the women, according to several people briefed on the investigation.The search warrant carried out by the public corruption unit of the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan sought information about Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she carried on a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006. Ms. McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc., The Enquirer’s parent company, whose chief executive is a friend of Mr. Trump’s.Agents were also searching the office and hotel room of the lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for information related to Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump while he was married. Mr. Cohen has acknowledged that he paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement to secure her silence days before the 2016 presidential election.The president, who reacted to news of the raids on Monday by lashing out at his top law enforcement officials, described the investigations in a Twitter post on Tuesday as “ A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!! ” and later declined to respond to reporters’ questions. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, refused to say that Mr. Trump retains confidence in his attorney general, deputy attorney general or F.B.I. director. She also said that Mr. Trump “believes he has the power” to fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia inquiry, a position directly contradicted by federal regulations.Stephen Ryan, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, said that it was Mr. Mueller who referred evidence to the federal authorities in New York who carried out Monday’s raids. In an email on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan repeated his assertion that the raids were “inappropriate and unnecessary.”Mr. Trump has been dogged for months by accusations that women with whom he is said to have had affairs were paid to keep quiet before the election — charges that the White House has repeatedly said he denies.Ms. McDougal has claimed that she had a 10-month consensual affair with Mr. Trump 12 years ago. American Media, which is owned by David J. Pecker, agreed to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in August 2016, but did not publish it in a practice known as catch and kill. Ms. Clifford, who told her story about an affair with Mr. Trump to CBS’s “60 Minutes” last month, is aggressively challenging the nondisclosure agreement she agreed to in October 2016, receiving $130,000 in return.ImageCritics of the president have claimed that payments to Karen McDougal, left, and Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, amount to illegal campaign contributions.CreditGetty ImagesIt is unclear exactly why the New York investigators are examining the payments. But critics of the president have claimed that they amount to illegal campaign contributions because they helped Mr. Trump win the White House by suppressing politically damaging stories.The F.B.I. also searched for records related to Mr. Cohen’s New York taxicab business, apparently a separate line of inquiry unrelated to Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen is a longtime owner of taxi medallions, at one point operating a fleet of more than 200 cabs in Manhattan.Besides enraging Mr. Trump, the early-morning searches, associates said, also led him to privately wonder whether he should fire Rod J. Rosenstein, the veteran prosecutor appointed by Mr. Trump to serve as deputy attorney general. Mr. Rosenstein personally signed off on Monday’s F.B.I. decision to raid the office of Mr. Cohen, several government officials said.Justice Department regulations require prosecutors to consult with senior officials in Washington, but not necessarily the deputy attorney general, before conducting a search of a lawyer’s files, which is among the most delicate steps federal prosecutors can take in an investigation.Mr. Trump has long been mistrustful of Mr. Rosenstein, who appointed Mr. Mueller, and now oversees his investigation. In his remarks on Monday night, the president lashed out at Mr. Rosenstein for having “signed a FISA warrant,” apparently a reference to the role Mr. Rosenstein played in authorizing the wiretap of a Trump associate in the Russia inquiry.Mr. Trump considered firing Mr. Rosenstein last summer. Instead, he ordered Mr. Mueller to be fired, then backed down after the White House counsel refused to carry out the order, The New York Times reported in January .As Mr. Trump has stewed over the developments, he has cast blame in many directions. Privately, people close to the president said, he has blamed Mr. Cohen for acknowledging the payments to Ms. Clifford.On Monday evening, Mr. Trump called the court-authorized raids an “attack on our country” — unusually harsh language that he has not used to describe Russia’s attempts to influence an American election through hacking and propaganda — and the raids are likely to complicate Mr. Trump’s negotiations with Mr. Mueller over the terms of a possible interview.Mr. Trump’s lawyers have warned that such an interview would be incredibly risky, but Mr. Trump had been confident in his ability and was eager to sit for one. People close to the president said the raids could change that thinking.The president’s reaction has deeply unsettled aides, current and former Justice Department officials and lawmakers from both parties, who believe the president may use the raids as a pretext to purge the team leading the Russia investigation.“Now is the time for officials in the executive branch and Congress who care about the rule of law to counsel against any effort to undermine the special counsel’s work,” said David Laufman, a former top Justice Department official who oversaw the Russia investigation before Mr. Mueller’s appointment.Mr. Trump’s advisers have spent the past 24 hours trying to persuade the president not to make an impulsive decision that could put him in more legal jeopardy, several people close to Mr. Trump said. In one of his Tuesday morning tweets, he vented that “ attorney-client privilege is dead! ”Adding to the concern among Mr. Trump’s aides about his mood is the release next week of a book by James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, which is expected to be sharply critical of the president.The involvement of Mr. Rosenstein and top prosecutors in New York in the raids of Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room makes it harder for Mr. Trump to argue that his legal problems are the result of a witch hunt led by Mr. Mueller. In addition to Mr. Rosenstein, all of the top law enforcement officials involved in the raids are Republicans, including Mr. Mueller and Christopher A. Wray, Mr. Trump’s choice to succeed Mr. Comey as director of the F.B.I.ImageMr. Trump has long been mistrustful of Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who appointed the special counsel and now oversees his investigation.CreditWin Mcnamee/Getty ImagesGeoffrey Berman, the interim United States attorney for Southern District of New York, which oversaw the raids, has been recused from the case, according to one person with knowledge with the matter. The precise reason was not clear, but under Justice Department guidelines, a United States attorney must report any issue that could require recusal “as a result of an actual or apparent conflict of interest.”Mr. Berman, who worked as a volunteer lawyer on Mr. Trump’s campaign, was the choice of Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, to be the United States attorney in New York, according to a person with direct knowledge of the appointment.While Mr. Trump is focused for the moment on Mr. Rosenstein, many of the president’s advisers and allies are fearful that the president also intends to fire Mr. Mueller in an attempt to end the Russia investigation. Asked by reporters on Monday night whether he intends to do so, Mr. Trump said, “We’ll see what happens.”Despite Tuesday’s assertions by Ms. Sanders, many legal experts believe the president cannot fire Mr. Mueller himself, and would have to direct Mr. Rosenstein to do so. Mr. Rosenstein has told Congress that he would dismiss Mr. Mueller only for cause, and people close to Mr. Rosenstein have indicated that he would resign if he were ordered to fire Mr. Mueller by the president.Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to protect Mr. Mueller, with senators urging Mr. Trump to let the inquiry go forward “without impediment.” Republican leadership has dismissed such legislation as unnecessary.The prospect that Mr. Trump might still find a way to fire Mr. Mueller elicited angry responses from Congressional Democrats and some Republicans, who warned that such a move would be disastrous for the White House.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that “it would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller.”On Monday, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, called Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mr. Mueller and his team a “grave reminder of his utter contempt for the rule of law.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate’s top Democrat, urged the president: “Don’t do it, do not go down this path. For the sake of our country, we plead with you.”Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the day on which Michael D. Cohen posted a message on Twitter quoting an author.

The Next BIG Payout is Estimated for July 27th, 2018.""I've collected over $4,000 and still going strong!... Income is very important to me.""– Gary D. 74-year-old retireeIt doesn't matter if you love Trump or if you hate him...One thing's for certain...The proof is in this type of check right here...I call it a ""M.A.G.A."" check.M.A.G.A. stands for Make America Great Again, which is the campaign promise Donald Trump ran on.And it looks like he's fully intending to keep that promise...Because today, any U.S. resident can collect these massive checks... regardless of age, income, or employment status.Just ask Jim G., a retired health and safety manager from Iowa State University. He's on pace to collect $5,295 in ""M.A.G.A. checks"" before the year is over.Commercial real estate developer Fredrick M. is taking advantage too. He is using this program to collect an additional $18,000 this year.And 79-year-old Neil W. is set to collect $24,000 on his first year of M.A.G.A. checks.And here's the best part...You don't have to stand in long lines at any government center... or fill out complicated forms... or even provide sensitive information to begin collecting your ""M.A.G.A. checks.""With just a few clicks of the mouse or a quick phone call, you could be sitting back, collecting your own M.A.G.A. checks, too.I'll show you exactly how in this video...Checks worth $1,200...$13,000...even $18,000 or more depending on your investment.That's why some of America's wealthiest and smartest investors are cashing in on this secret too...Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, can expect to receive a M.A.G.A.check for $313,028 this year.America's second richest hedge fund manager – billionaire Jim Simons – can expect to collect around $184,354 every month in M.A.G.A. checks.Don't worry... you don't need to be a billionaire to collect these types of checks... not even close.62-year-old retired engineer, Peter P. had this to say...[As of] March of 2017... I have made about $17,880.76-year-old lawyer, Lou H. is collecting checks worth about $4,066 this year.Alan A. is set to receive an additional $9,384.In fact, this program is so revolutionary, even the mainstream press is beginning to take notice.As Kiplinger magazine says, ""M.A.G.A checks"" can provide a steady stream of income that will last a lifetime.""Forbes called the income from ""M.A.G.A. Checks"", ""very reliable and repeatable.""Nasdaq.com claims...""M.A.G.A Checks"" will soar in 2018.And to be clear, because this is not a government program or sponsored by the government like Social Security or Medicare are, your payouts are virtually unlimited depending on your investment...In fact, in any given month you could receive multiple checks thanks to this investment opportunity.For instance, there's a $66 million M.A.G.A check payout estimated for June 8th. Around June 15th,there's another massive payout of $57 million... And around June 30th, an astonishing $400 million will be sent to thousands of Americans. In July, the payouts keep coming and they're even bigger...$25 million is estimated to be sent out around July 15th. Over $303 millionaround July 16th. $105 million in M.A.G.A checks will go out around July 27th. And around July 31st, the amount of money up for grabs will be over $325 million.Imagine what your life would be like if you could get checks deposited directly into your account, over and over again.In fact, I've already shown dozens of ordinary people across America how to begin collecting ""M.A.G.A. checks"" with amazing results...Folks like...Hank C. who told us he should receive $9,456 in 2018.Bob A. used to run a restoration company with his wife but retired two years ago.So far, they're on pace to collect around $2,400 in M.A.G.A. checks and are using the income to help grow their nest egg.Jacksonville, Florida resident John B. said he's collecting $15,129 and is very satisfied.But you'll want to set yourself up now, so you can start collecting your checks right away.Folks like Randy T. who has collected $9,306 in his first year.Reed N., also started collecting his own checks. He's already made $965 dollars and expects to earn an additional $3,782 this year...And Shawn M. – a 65-year-old retired engineer – uses his checks in his active lifestyle.In the next several weeks, you can start collecting your very own checks and put the money to use however you see fit.Maybe you'll finally take that dream vacation you've been planning for years... or even buy a vacation home...Maybe you'd like to help a family member in need or put your grandkids through college.Brian H. – a 57-year-old trial lawyer – told us he uses this income stream to fund his sons trust account.And a woman named Teresa wrote me and said she used this income stream to help make her sister $6,000 a year.Or perhaps, you'd like to simply donate it to a good cause that's near and dear to your heart.Whether you decide to spend your checks or tuck them away for a rainy day...It's your money to spend however you'd like.And as you're about to see, the next big windfall is yet to come. But time is of the essence. I strongly recommend you take a few steps BEFORE July 27th.I'll show you why in just a moment.Here's everything you need to know to get started right away.How ""M.A.G.A. checks"" put money BACK into the pockets of ordinary, hardworking folksIt's not hard to see how M.A.G.A.checks could have a profound impact on your retirement...Just listen to the story of a man named Kirk O. and you'll see exactly what I mean.Kirk is your typical hardworking American.He lives in Nevada and was a truck driver for many years.But 5 years ago – at the age of 61 – a work related accident forced him to stop working and go into early retirement.To make matters worse, not too long after, he was diagnosed with cancer.This would put most Americans in a dire financial situation.But luckily for Kirk, he discovered a unique opportunity made possible by several companies, which allowed him to start collecting safe and steady income ever since.Today, he earns over $1,200 a month in M.A.G.A. checks and his goal is to collect over $2,000 a month, very soon.All without working or leaving the house.Kirk wrote us a letter saying, ""I'm able to generate money... to live on and have enough funds to still play poker.""In a moment, I'll tell you exactly how to start collecting your own M.A.G.A. checks. It's simple to get started.You see, over the past few weeks, my inbox has been overflowing with stories of dozens of people who've discovered this situation.The best part is, ANYONE with a bit of investment capital can do it.Just look at some of the notes I've received:""I have helped my children with house down payments and have been able to purchase several new vehicles without financing.""– Jim K.""[This] provides me a comfortable living. I only use about half [of my payments] to support my lifestyle and travel. The remaining balance I invest."" – Dan D.And Otto S. – who has been a farmer for 60 years – expects to collect over $1,891 this year.Here's what he told me:""I'm 88, going on 89... income is an important issue to me – not rich, not poor... but at my age income is important.""I've created this presentation for two reasons...First, now is a great time to start collecting these checks.And second, whether you're in your 20s or well into retirement, by collecting these M.A.G.A. checks you'll be able to live life on your own terms, knowing that the checks will keep rolling in like clockwork depending on the size of your investment.But before I go any further...First, Let Me Introduce MyselfHi. My name is Dr. Steve Sjuggerud.I've had just about every job on Wall Street. I've been a stockbroker, Vice President of a global mutual fund at the age of 24, and President of a 250,000-reader program called Investment U.I've been asked to appear on numerous TV stations like Fox News and Bloomberg to help their viewers make sense of the financial world and offer new ways to grow and protect their wealth.I've helped ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and have given closed-door presentations to billionaires and some of the most famous investors on the planet.But my true passion is research... finding new and undiscovered opportunities to help ordinary Americans... Which is why about two decades ago, I left the Wall Street world behind.Don't get me wrong. I learned a lot... and I established a lot of important connections.But it didn't take long to find out my main job there wasn't to help my clients make money. It was to get as many new clients as possible and as much money as possible under management, to collect fees.That's not what I set out to do...Quitting the Wall Street side of finance was easily the best decision I've ever made.Now I get to spend my time doing what I love most... finding new and profitable investment ideas for regular folks... like the M.A.G.A. checks I've been describing in this presentation.Through my years of experience, I can tell you one thing with 100% conviction: Sufficient income is the #1 secret to a successful retirement.You must earn consistent income.In fact, this is one of the main reasons people love reading my work... because I routinely find new income opportunities you won't hear about from your broker or the mainstream press.For example...In 2009, I uncovered a series of Social Security ""loopholes"" that allowed retirees to increase the size of their monthly checks. It was a legal way to push the system in your favor and get paid an extra $1,100 or more per month, EVERY year.Some people even wrote in to share their results...""Based on Steve's research, I did a ""re-do"" on my Social Security last year... [I got] an increase of slightly more than $600 per month... It was a smart investment decision.""– Fred W.""The new monthly payment was $2,017... [which is] a GAIN of $495 per month!""– Bill B.""This has added $853 per month to our income without reducing [my wife's] Social Security benefits. Pretty neat!!""– Charles B.Not too long after the dotcom crash in 2001, I uncovered a little-known gov't-backed opportunity – something I called 'The Portfolio Repair Program' – that enabled investors to recoup some of the losses from the market crash – and even earn a steady amount of income...Not many Americans were aware this option was available to them. As far as I know, we were among the first to write about it.My passion for research has enabled me to uncover all sorts of new and exciting income opportunities you're not likely to hear about from a stockbroker or in the mainstream press.A few years ago, for example, I found a unique opportunity that allows you to collect tremendous royalties, every single month, simply by becoming a ""trademark"" owner of some of North America's most popular fast food chains.You simply become a part share holder of the trademarked name like McDonald's or Burger King. Then, every time one of these restaurants sells a burger, shake, or fries... you collect royalties.One of the opportunities I've recommended has paid consecutive monthly royalties since 2002! Total gains have been over 1,120% since inception.I've never seen this opportunity written about anywhere else!But what I'm most excited about right now is the income opportunity I began describing earlier in this presentation: the M.A.G.A. checks.So, why haven't you heard about these M.A.G.A. checks before?Where do these checks come from and how can you get started immediately?I'll show you...Trumps Promise to Put America FirstIn 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to ""Make America Great Again.""And when he officially took office on January 20, 2017, Trump got right down to business.Within his first year he helped pass a law that would immediately help thousands of Americans.His new law also helps a specific industry as much or more than any other. An industry he probably knows as well as anyone else in the country...The same industry that made him a billionaire...I'm talking, of course, about real estate.Now, it's widely known that Donald Trump's wealth comes from real estate.And for good reason...The U.S. real estate markets are among the most lucrative in the world.The total value of all the real estate in America is well over $35 Trillion.Real estate has helped create countless millionaires too. Probably more than any other industry in history.Did you know that 90% of the world's millionaires got there, in part, because of real estate!?That's a remarkable fact, isn't it?It's why some of America's richest people, like media mogul Ted Turner... Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos... and Microsoft founder Bill Gates are all huge real estate investors too.You see, real estate is vital to the success of the American economy.Yes, it provides housing for families.But most people don't realize that commercial real estate also creates jobs, spaces for retail, offices, storage, warehousing, and manufacturing.Agricultural real estate is essential for the production of crops and livestock... of our food supply... of our building supplies... and more.In short, real estate is the secret backbone of American wealth and ingenuity.The ultra-rich know this.Personally, I own stocks, gold, shares of private business, and more. But by far my largest holdings today and by far the biggest profits of my career have come from real estate.The thing is, tapping into this great source of wealth has often been time-consuming and expensive... essentially making many of the best real estate investments off limits to the little guy.Enter Trump, who's recent law helps revitalize an obscure government real estate program from the 1960sYou see back then, the government wanted to make sure certain companies would always have a built-in financial incentive to keep America's real estate markets strong.These are the companies that develop... manage... and own America's best commercial, residential, and agricultural real estate.So, congress proposed a plan that would allow these companies to get away with paying practically ZERO Federal income taxes.In exchange, the government required these businesses to turn over the bulk of their earnings to shareholders – that's regular folks like you and me – in the form of steady payments.But here's the thing. The government didn't heavily advertise this program, so many investors never knew it existed.After all, it was buried deep inside an obscure bill passed back in 1960.But Trump's new legislation brings this program back to the forefront of the American economy, in a major way – allowing everyday Americans to collect more and bigger paychecks from America's most lucrative real estate investments...For example, one company– based in Kansas City, Missouri – is paying over $26 million every single month to ordinary Americans right now.Another one based in Bethesda, Maryland, is sending out $70 Million every single month to ordinary folks...Imagine how your life would change by tapping into this income stream...And an institution in New York City is expected to send over $1.35 billion to a handful of citizens in 2018.The best part is, anyone in America can now be a part of these massive payouts.Folks like...Dana H., a 67-year-old retired manufacturing manager, who says he enjoys a $1,880 yearly payment from just one of these institutions.Retired Aerospace engineer, Kurt B., who has already collected over $11,000 in what we're calling ""M.A.G.A. checks.""And Kevin T., who is collecting M.A.G.A. checks worth around $4,200, like clockwork.Look...We've had a lot of great men as Presidents, but none of them have been as successful in business, or had such an intimate understanding of the real estate markets as Donald Trump...He's a billionaire because of it.So, it makes sense that he's the one to lead Americans to this opportunity.But the question is... Why haven't you heard about this opportunity before?Well... the main reason is probably because there just aren't a lot of companies that distribute these Trump-approved ""M.A.G.A. checks.""Only about 1 out of 26,000 companies in America are registered to participate.As I said, these companies must be able to produce lots of cash via real estate income... and pay it out to ordinary Americans like you and me. Not just any business is eligible to register in the program.So, how does it all work?How can you find one of these organizations and begin tapping in to these huge payouts year after year?Let me show you...CASE STUDY: M.A.G.A.-Approved San Diego Firm Pays Out MillionsMake no mistake, these special institutions send out billions of dollars in checks every year.One example is an institution based out of San Diego, CA.Even though you've probably never heard of it before, it owns some of the most valuable real estate in America and then leases it to the country's top commercial enterprises.I'm talking about huge corporations like Wal-Mart, FedEx, BJ's, Walgreens, and Home Depot, just to name a few.That's some pretty important real estate, wouldn't you agree?As a result, this firm rakes in billions of dollars in revenue every year.But here's the thing.Unlike most businesses today, this company doesn't pay a penny in income taxes to Uncle Sam...Thanks to this Trump-approved plan, a huge portion of this money – even larger than what they paid before – now goes directly into the pockets of ordinary citizens like you and me.The business behind this payout LOVES this arrangement. In fact, they're fanatical about paying out huge income checks to Americans, month after month... year after year.It even clearly states that paying out this income is their primary goal on page 4 of their most recent annual report...We have remained dedicated to our mission of providing... dependable monthly [incomes] that increase over time.Companies avoid annoying taxes... investors get huge monthly checks... and the U.S. economy gets a boost. Everybody wins.Just look at a few more of these M.A.G.A.-approved institutions paying out huge streams of income...Like this institution based in Glendale, California.It's the largest public storage provider in the U.S and is on pace to send over $1.6 billion in M.A.G.A. checks to Americans, in 2018.Another one headquartered in Chicago owns more than 1,200 hospitals and senior living centers.It's also on pace to deposit over $827 million into accounts this year...A growing firm in Boston owns over 70 million square feet of industrial properties and on pace to deliver more than $141 million to thousands of Americans before 2018 is over.One nationwide institution owns roughly 13 million acres of forest throughout the U.S. and they create construction materials needed to rebuild some of our country's aging infrastructure...They'll send around $235 million worth of M.A.G.A. checks every 3 months this year.Another institution based in Boston owns more than 150,000 cell towers which helps American businesses communicate and stay competitive every single day.And they've already started sending checks of the $1.1 billion set to go out this year.I've been conducting independent financial research for over 20 years and I can tell you with 100% conviction... this is one of the best income opportunities I've ever seen.And look, I'm not just saying this. I'm investing in real estate with my own money, too.I'm in the middle of setting up a private deal for my business partners and me that could deliver us $100,000 or more a year in real estate income.Another real estate deal I have in place pays me several thousand a month.Depending on your situation, you could use these income streams I've been telling you about to collect up to 24 checks or more every single year.Just so we're clear: there are always risks involved with investing, and you should never put more into this idea than you could afford to lose.That being said, I really believe in the potential for the low-risk, consistent income you can earn from this opportunity.But I'll be upfront with you, if you want to get in on the next payout...You need to position yourself NOW.That's because the next payout date is scheduled for the end of July. And if you want to be a part of this payout you simply must be in by the deadline.I want you to collect as many checks as possible, before the year's over.And set yourself up for a chance at lifelong income, if that's something you'd like.That's why I recently went through all 225 Trump-approved institutions and selected the very best ones.The best institutions with the biggest and safest paydays...Let me tell you a little more about them...How to Tap into the World's Greatest Income StreamI narrowed these institutions down based on 4 critical factors.FIRST, I want to make sure these institutions are being managed by the best and brightest in the industry... folks who know the real estate world as well as Donald Trump – like the backs of their hands.If you choose to get involved with one of these institutions, you need to know it's being managed in a way that will deliver you the biggest checks.One of the men running these firms, for example, has been in the real estate markets for over 20 years and successfully managed a real estate portfolio valued at $700 billion.Which leads me to the SECOND factor I look for.The institution must have a history of consistently paying lots of big checks to shareholders.These companies rake in LOTS of cash... and we only want the ones that have a history of doling out as much of this money as possible over the longest period of time.One of these firms for example has made these payouts EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the past 3 years, without skipping a beat.THIRD, I like to make sure the people who work closely with or operate these institutions ""put their money where their mouth is,"" so to speak. Inside ownership is one of the secrets to evaluating the true health of a business.And the FOURTH factor may be the most important.We want the BIGGEST and FATTEST checks.This part is key.Based on the research my team and I have done, the companies that pay out the biggest checks typically have one thing in common...They own one very specific kind of real estate asset...In fact, of the 225 institutions in the country, only a small handful actually own this asset.These companies pay out, on average, 3 TIMES more than the other M.A.G.A.-check companies...I won't tell you exactly what this asset is right here, but the important thing to know is... it's generally government-backed real estate assets.This not only makes these checks bigger, but SAFER, and more reliable, too.One of the things I love about this opportunity is that while stocks have become very expensive since the financial crisis of 2008, you can still get into incredible deals in real estate that produces tons of reliable income.In fact, real estate is my #1 favorite investment for the next decade. I think it's going to be much more lucrative, much safer, and much more reliable than anything else out there.How much income could you earn? That's completely up to you.One of the best parts of getting M.A.G.A. checks is that you decide how much you're paid.That's why I've put the full details of everything you need to know in my recent report called...M.A.G.A. Checks: How to Cash in on the White House's Multibillion-Dollar Program.In this special report, I'll tell you what I believe are the 4 most stable, reliable and cash-rich companies in the M.A.G.A. program today – ones that regularly dole out big cash payments to their shareholders.One of these institutions, for example, payed out a whopping $1.3 BILLION in M.A.G.A. checks to thousands of Americans last year.And has already sent out $348,000,000 million in 2018.It has government-backed real estate assets in California, Texas, and New York, just to name a few.The second institution – based in Maryland – sends out $70 million every single month.And there's no sign of these checks going away.This is a no brainer if you want monthly checks rolling in like clockwork.Which is probably why a hedge-fund manager – billionaire Jim Simons – decided to rely on this institution to bring in $184,354 every month.Depending on your situation you could soon see checks worth $1,200... $1,800... even $3,600, or more in some cases.It all depends on how much you're willing to put in.The third institution detailed in the report is a New York based firm.Because of its unique position, you can tap into the $301 million income stream the company paid last year, backed by $11 billion worth of real estate throughout the countries major markets.And they've already sent $67,077,800 out this year.And the fourth company might be the best opportunity yet...In short, this company is the best in class.Thanks to the experienced and nimble management team in place, this institution has been able to outperform its competition.Which is why it's prepared to send out an estimated $422 million this year.But you'll want to get your name on the list in advance if you'd like to get a cut of this massive payout.Remember: If you want to get started collecting these checks, you must act soon.The next scheduled payout date is around July 27th.Everything you need to know to take advantage of these amazing situations – and start collecting M.A.G.A. checks repeatedly – is detailed inside my new report called: M.A.G.A. Checks: How to Cash in on the White House's Multibillion Dollar Program.This report is yours free of charge when you consider a no-risk trial subscription to my monthly independent research advisory called True Wealth...Let me tell you a little about it so you can decide if it's right for you...A New Way to Build Wealth in AmericaWhat we've found after writing to literally hundreds of thousands of people who are looking to enhance their income is that most people simply don't realize there are safer and more profitable investments than ordinary stocks and bonds.I promise you this: True Wealth is like no other investment newsletter you have seen before.I guarantee that in True Wealth you will learn about unique opportunities you won't hear about anywhere else.Is True Wealth right for you? I can't say for sure, but I believe the research my team and I do is better than anything else out there, on or off Wall Street.Our track record backs this up...For example, I'm particularly proud of the investments we found after the dotcom bust, which could have made our subscribers, who decided to act on our recommendations, very nice gains while most investors were too scared to act...I told my readers about a unique type of currency investment outside the stock market. They had the chance to capture 273% gains.In 2005, I uncovered a new type of gold company most people had never heard about before, called a ""prospect generator."" These companies don't explore for or mine gold, but their share prices typically go up much higher and faster in gold bull markets.As a result, our readers had the chance to pocket massive 995% gains when the price of gold took off.And back in 2011, right after a new health bill was passed, I knew it'd mean a surge of new capital for one investment in particular. Our readers were among the first to know about it and had the opportunity to see gains as high as 420%.I know anyone can cherry-pick a few winners, but our overall track record is unmatched as far as I know over both the short and long term.For instance, since inception the average annualized return on all my True Wealth recommendations was more than doubled the return of the stock market. That's pretty significant, considering most mutual funds and hedge funds rarely even beat the market.As the head of our firm said, ""There isn't a better investor anywhere in the world than Steve Sjuggerud.""I'm extremely proud of the hard work we've done for our readers...Right now, for example, we have more than 20 recommendations in our model stock portfolio... and they've gone up an average of 26% since we recommended them.But, at the end of the day, nothing makes me happier than hearing how our research has impacted the lives of thousands of readers...Like James H. who said:""I've made over $2 million [in six months].""80-year-old retire, Robert B. sent me this note:""Dr. Steve Sjuggerud... has helped me enormously in the management of my wife's portfolio; it has quadrupled since I took it away from her advisor.""True Wealth reader, Michael M. said:""I'm up more than $400,000.""Clyde L. wrote in to share his success, too:""I have been following Steve's investments for several years... My investment was approximately $600,000 and now its well over $1,000,000... Other letters... don't hold a light to Steve's. He is very honest.""And my personal favorite...A handwritten note from a subscriber named Bill G.He went on to show me in detail how he'd used my research to make almost $1,000,000 over the past 4 years.Remember, these people once faced the same decision you face today.Now, I can't promise you'll make $1 million following my work... and I can't tell you if True Wealth is right for you. Past performance doesn't guarantee future success.But I've come up with a way for you to find out – totally risk free.Your M.A.G.A. Checks Are WaitingA one-year subscription to True Wealth, including everything I mentioned here, normally costs $199 per year.

While Zuckerberg has been apologizing for the sheer scope of data Cambridge got its hands on, it seems his solution is simply to give our data to different conservative political operatives, like the Koch Brothers.In response to the scandal, Zuckerberg is going to hand over regulatory power on the use of data for academic research to, and I'm not making this up, the Charles Koch Foundation. pic.twitter.com/s5GfceNEH4 Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) April 9, 2018The Charles and David Koch Foundation run by the notorious right-wing billionaire Koch Brothers is one of several groups working together to study and inform the public on Facebooks role in influencing elections. Scholars supported by the Koch Brothers and others will be given access to Facebooks proprietary data and methodology developed as a response to its issues with Cambridge Analytica.Were proud to join the Hewlett Foundation, Knight Foundation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Democracy Fund, Omidyar Network, Arnold Foundation, and Facebook in supporting independent scholarship that addresses the urgent and profound questions regarding technologys role in civic discourse, the open exchange of ideas, and other hallmarks of a liberal democracy, here and around the world, said Koch Foundation president Brian Hooks. These questions, like others addressing some of the most pressing issues of our day, will benefit from open inquiry and academic exploration.This massive research operation is not specifically named in Zuckerbergs prepared remarks to Congress in his testimony but is a part of his broader topic of how to improve Facebook security in light of Cambridge Analytica and Russia abusing the platform.Mark Zuckerberg will be answering questions before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees and on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose names and office phone numbers are linked above. The committees are likely to ask questions about the safety measures being put in place to prevent this new wave of data from finding political use.

RyanApril 9, 2018In DepthLATEST UPDATE: April 9, 2018: Statement by Stephen M. RyanToday the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients. I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.The decision by the US Attorney’s Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary. It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.UPDATE: Statement by Stephen M. Ryan on behalf of Michael D. CohenMr. Cohen has accepted the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence invitation to appear on October 25, 2017.The following is a paraphrased version of Mr. Ryan's statement, which was communicated live immediately following Mr. Cohen's appearance on September 19, 2017:Mr. Cohen appeared voluntarily for an interview with the Senate Select Intelligence Committee. Mr. Cohen looked forward to answering all their questions.Last week, the fact that Mr. Cohen was appearing for an interview was leaked to the press. We do not know who did this, and we did not. Accordingly, we provided a copy of the short opening statement Mr. Cohen intended to present today to the media. That statement was factual, accurate and respectful, and consistent with the information we had previously provided to the Committee. We stand by the statement.The Committee has chosen to postpone today’s voluntary interview and reschedule it for a later day. Mr. Cohen will continue to cooperate and will come back when the Committee is ready. Stephen Ryan of McDermott Will & Emery represents Michael Cohen, Esq. of NYC in any governmental inquiries regarding the ‘Russia investigations’. Mr. Cohen is cooperating with all governmental inquiries. Available Documents:

Photograph: Adam Gabbatt for the GuardianA motorcycle group’s plan to “raise awareness” of the threat of homegrown jihad by riding to an all-Muslim New York town backfired on Sunday, when only five motorcyclists showed up. Hundreds of people, meanwhile, flocked to the town to show their support for its residents.Islamville, South Carolina's all-Muslim town, faces Trump effect: 'We feel unsafe'Read moreAmerican Bikers United Against Jihad spent months calling for people to take part in the event, which organizers described as a “ride for national security” and promised would see “hundreds” of bikers riding past Islamberg, in upstate New York .But the five riders who showed up found themselves completely overshadowed when more than 400 people travelled to Islamberg – some driving for hours to get there – to take part in a “peace rally and community day”.As the motorcyclists rode past the town, about three hours north-west of New York City, residents and supporters stood along the street. Some waved American flags, some called out “Welcome!” Others chanted: “Freedom, justice, USA!”“I don’t know what they’re riding against,” said Islamberg mayor Rashid Clark. “My only concern is for our safety. It doesn’t provoke me.”After witnessing the ride-by, the supporters – who included people from Christian churches and other faiths – were welcomed into the town. Residents laid on food, music and speeches from community leaders.“We just decided, ‘OK, if you want to ride by we’re going to hold a peace rally,’” said Clark, 46. “And that idea came from the fact that all these community members, all these people you see here, they also found [details of the rally] online and they called us, and said they wanted to come and support. This turnout is not our doing.”The majority of Islamberg residents are African Americans. The town was established by The Muslims of America in 1984, and is home to around 25 families. The organization has established more than a dozen towns across the US, with Islamberg serving as its headquarters.A series of online conspiracy theories have given rise to the idea that Muslims of America towns are home to jihad training camps. The notion has been repeatedly debunked by law enforcement officials, but this has not deterred extremists.In April 2015, a man named Robert Doggart pleaded guilty to planning to attack Islamberg . He faces trial this summer. In November 2015, the FBI issued a warning to New York police after Jon Ritzheimer, a man later involved in the occupation of the Malheur wildlife refuge in Oregon , posted a video online saying he planned to drive to Islamberg and confront residents.American Bikers United Against Jihad planned to set off for Islamberg at noon. Ram Lubranicki, the main organiser, described the ride as an “educational” event designed to draw attention to “jihad camps” in the town.PinterestMayor Rashid Clark of Islamberg, New York. Photograph: Adam Gabbatt for the GuardianLubranicki, from New Jersey, called for bikers to congregate in a parking lot in Deposit, around seven miles from Islamberg. At 11.45am, there were three bikers present.“So far it’s a little disappointing,” Lubranicki said. “If we had great weather we could easily have a few hundred bikers here.”Lubranicki was upbeat.“There’s certainly a lot of excitement about this idea,” he said. “We’re in the process of developing a website.”Lubranicki was not riding a motorcycle. He said he was conscious he would be required to talk to the press – there were two journalists present – and there would be a lot of organizing to do.Lubranicki had travelled from New Jersey in a champagne-colored Hyundai Sonata. As he waited for bikers to arrive, he draped a banner over the rear of the car. It bore the logo of the American Bikers United Against Jihad: a skull draped in the American flag with a sword alongside.Beneath the banner there was a bottle, functioning as a collections jar. It contained $23.A fourth motorcyclist – a man named Hal, who was wearing a skull cap and a black leather vest with a large Grateful Dead patch on the back – arrived at 11.55am. Another turned up at 12.05.The riders delayed the start for an hour, in case any attendees were late arriving. None were.The group drew out of the parking lot at 1pm, the five bikers following Lubranicki’s Sonata. Three other cars were present, bringing the number of ride against jihad attendees to 12 people and one dog.State troopers were posted along the route to Islamberg, but the ride passed without event. The riders finished their tour at a parking lot beyond the town, before going their separate ways.Back at Islamberg, hundreds were enjoying food prepared by the town’s residents. A large tent had been erected: attendees chatted as they dined on chicken, pasta, potato salad and salad.Josie Hovis, 15, had heard about the peace rally through her church, Cooperstown First Presbyterian, and had travelled the two hours with her parents and brother.“You hear a lot of nasty information in the news, especially in this presidential campaign, and it makes you sad and depressed about the state of things in the world,” she said.“But most of the time people don’t really do anything about it. And this was an opportunity to really take action about the bigotry we see today.”Dr Bilqees Abdullah, who declined to give her age but described herself as “seasoned”, has lived in Islamberg for around 30 years. She works in a local hospital as well as providing care for the elderly in the town.“It was very, very heartwarming,” she said of the peace rally. “To see so many people come and join and actually say: ‘This isn’t right, this isn’t fair, and we’re not going for it,’ it’s wonderful. Very wonderful.”Topics	2016/05/16

The entrance to Trump International Golf Club, the president's course du jour while at the so-called Winter White House in Mar-a-Lago, had new decoration on Saturday evening in the form of red paint splattered all over one of the entrance signs. More Donald Trump Headlines Shulkin declines to fully endorse Trump's pick to replace him Trump: 'NO MORE DACA DEAL' WaPo: Left alone, Trump is now calling his own shots The red paint was tossed haphazardly on the left entrance with a can of paint visible on the ground. It's unclear exactly when the vandalism happened. Two vans from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department were on scene investigating the apparent vandalism Saturday at about 10 p.m. Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the sheriff's department responded to inquiries from ABC News Saturday night. Donald Trump spent Saturday at Trump International Golf Club, according to the Tampa Bay Times, though it's not clear if he was on the course. Trump was at the club on Friday as well. The president is usually secretive about whether he actually hits the links or not. Fox News host Sean Hannity and PGA golfer Dustin Johnson spent time with Trump at the golf club on Saturday as well, according to Palm Beach Post reporter George Bennett. Donald Trump Jr. shared a photo on Instagram of his daughter Kai with Johnson, the current world No. 1 player and 2016 U.S. opener winner, on the course. It's not clear whether any of the Trumps were at the club when the vandalism occurred. Trump opened the golf club in 1999, the first of what is now many courses in his portfolio. According to ABC News' analysis of public records of Trump's schedule, the president spent 109 days at one of his properties in his first year in office. The president's Mar-a-Lago estate is just a 15-minute drive from Trump International. ABC News"	2018/04/01

She was also dismissed as a contributing writer on The Daily Show. The move comes after Wolf’s brutal takedown of Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the White House Correspondent’s dinner:“I think she’s very resourceful, like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies.”What she obviously meant, if you listen to just about anyone, was that Sanders is a fat pig with lazy eye. Isn’t it obvious? Comedy Central thought so and dropped the hammer. CEO Art Tubolls released a statement:“Comedy Central doesn’t take it lightly when a member of our team throws a compliment out that the whole world takes as an insult. It was uncalled for. Michelle should have anticipated people’s reaction and softened the speech to suit the needs of the room.”Yes, that seems perfectly reasonable. Wolf, who 99.3 percent of conservatives had never heard of before this morning’s news that she wasn’t funny, is suing for wrongful termination.

She’s never denied eating well and working out religiously as the answer to a strong and sculpted body. She puts her star power behind brands that promote vitamin-infused water and no-gimmicks natural skin care, like Aveeno. She’s not quoted saying bad things about people, especially people she once loved. She’s often photographed smiling and laughing with her husband Justin Theroux or her friends from Friends . She stands up for herself , but only when she’s pushed to the edge.Perhaps most remarkable is that in a world that measures success by one’s Instagram following, Aniston, 48, who will soon return to primetime TV with friend Reese Witherspoon, has chosen to opt out of social media completely, favoring early dinners on Sundays with family, and high-intensity, sweat-drenching workouts instead. “[Social media] is such a drag,” she says. Below, a window into why Jennifer Aniston is the poster woman for wellness.Where are you right now?I’m in La La Land, which is home for me. New York is home in my heart, though. . . . What do you wanna know?So much! First, you have a new TV show in the works that you’re costarring in and coproducing with Reese Witherspoon. Is TV the best gig in Hollywood right now and if so, why?Absolutely! I love that I go to a set every day and do what I do, but I also love that I get to come home. And you’re usually not shooting a movie [or TV show] 12 months out of the year, so you get your time. It’s nice to be able to dip in, get your creative juices flowing, and then have your weekends. Any hardworking job that demands a lot of your time, whether you’re running a corporation or you’re an actor or a mom full-time, 24-7, it’s all about trying to find the balance and the time to refuel and recharge. We have so many screens: TVs, computers, phones. . . I worry we’re filling the days up with too much and it’s hard to focus on ourselves.Is that why you’re not on social media? One less screen?Sanity! Honestly, when I look around and see people constantly on their phones, I feel like we’re missing so much. And it’s something we created. I equate it to the tobacco industry; it’s hard enough being a kid growing up and becoming who you are and finding yourself but now you have social media and you’ve added this extra pressure of seeing if someone likes or doesn’t like something you did. We’re creating these man-made challenges and it’s a such a drag.What’s your ideal weekend?Dinner with friends. And Sundays, if it’s warm, we’ll go down by the pool and the kids will come over and everybody plays and we make lunch and we roll into an early Sunday supper. We relax and hike and usually there is a workout class that happens.What type of workouts are you hip to right now?I go in and out of [certain exercises]. I do The Class by Taryn Toomey , and I’m back in the gym with my trainer, throwing heavy boulders around and pushing medicine balls and wiggling and shaking that big rope thing— —Battle Ropes.Yes! They’re hard! But it’s fun. I started doing that when I was filming We’re the Millers and I really liked it. It kicks your butt, though, so I dip in and out of that throughout the year. And then I do 45 mins of intervals on my elliptical. I raise the incline, run for two mins, walk for one, run for two. . . and I do it for 20 minutes straight until I’m just drenched.Let’s talk about your beauty routine because, unlike most people in Hollywood, yours has pretty much stayed the same. And of course, your bronde hair color is back in style.Bronde?! That’s what they’re calling it? That’s so funny. I’m a creature of habit. A weird creature of habit. I don’t fix what’s not broken and I don’t care what people think and I don’t care if people want me to change my hair. I like Californian blonde highlights. It’s just cozy and it makes me feel better. And every time I tried other ones—that bob—I just go, Why did I do that? I’ve got very wavy hair so it creates a challenge when styling but when its long, I can go wavy or natural or straight and it will sort of just behave. I don’t know, I like what I like. It’s sort of comforting—the consistence.Friends is still on everybody’s mind, and in everybody’s Netflix queue. . .Isn’t that funny?! It’s a weird resurgence, it’s like you’re frozen in time. Girls come up to me thinking that I’m still on the show! I’m so proud that it could have a second wind and still feel relatable, though.Relatable—and on trend. Someone recently called you the OG of #FreeTheNipple because of how often Rachel’s nipples showed through her outfits.Yeah, I don’t know what to say about that! It’s just one of those things, I guess. I wear a bra, I don’t know what to tell ya! And I don’t know why we’re supposed to be ashamed of them—it’s just the way my breasts are! But hey, OG, I’m not going to complain!You once wrote an op-ed about getting harassed by paparazzi and baby-shamed by tabloids. . . . Do you think it’s gotten any better since you hit publish last July?I don’t think it’s getting much better. I think the problem is the tabloids and the gossip columns taking the human body and putting it in a category. They’re either fat-shaming, or body-shaming, or childless-shaming. It’s a weird obsession that people have and I don’t understand exactly why they need to take people who are out there to entertain you, and rip them apart and bully them? Why are we teaching young women this? It’s incredibly damaging. I was finally like, This has just got to stop! I couldn’t hear this narrative anymore about being pregnant or not pregnant; you have no idea what is going on personally in our lives and why that is or is not happening and it feels. . . In my own brain, I’ve shifted my perspective, so who gives a shit! If you’re going to walk out and have your nipples showing, or your belly is a little bloated, or you’re not at the weight you want to be—you are perfect no matter what you are and no matter where you are and who cares! You have to tune out the noise, which is fine by me, because I just know that I’m happy and healthy and doing everything I can to be good in the world and to the people I work with. But, it’s hard. It’s something that people are addicted to: Salacious stories. Maybe [gossip magazines] will be dead one day. Who ever thought Donald Trump would be the President of the United States? I didn’t. I can’t predict squat anymore.	2001/11/19

It can be smoked or vaporized just like real cannabis but is considered to be far more dangerous due to the unpredictability of its contents.“We continue to see the number of cases rise,” IDPH Director Nirav D. Shah said in a statement on April 2nd. “IDPH is continuing to work with local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with other partners, to try to identify common products. Without more information, IDPH does not know how much contaminated product is circulating or where. We strongly urge everyone not to use synthetic cannabinoids.”According to local reports , treatment for those who have been poisoned by synthetic cannabis is available so long as medical attention is sought. Local health officials have told reporters that those seeking treatment will not face prosecution.While police are still investigating the origins of the substance which has hospitalized dozens across the state, three people were charged by the U.S. Attorney’s Office on Monday, April 2nd for selling synthetic cannabis from a convenience store on Chicago’s West Side.The three men were arrested after undercover officers managed to purchase the substance from the store owners and preliminary testing of the substance purchased found that it contained brodifacoum.SHARE	2018/05/15

Hot Air reported that Shaaf went on to give out a link to a Centro Legal de la Raza’s website which offers information about legal rights and options for people facing detention.“We understand ICE has used activity rumors in the past as a tactic to create fear; our intent is for our community to go about their daily lives without fear, but resiliency and awareness,” said Schaaf.Schaaf claimed that Oakland schools, police officers and business owners are prohibited from assisting ICE agents.“Oakland is a city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation,” she said. “I believe it is my duty and moral obligation as Mayor to give those families fair warning when that threat appears imminent.”However, according to the Cornell Law School, Schaaf may have violated federal law in doing this:8 U.S. Code § 1324 (a) (1) (A) (iii)Any person who, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation shall be punished as provided in subparagraph (B).8 U.S. Code § 1324 (a) (1) (B) (ii)A person who violates subparagraph (A) shall, for each alien in respect to whom such a violation occurs in the case of a violation of subparagraph (A)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v)(II), be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.SHARE this story if you think Libby Schaaf should be INVESTIGATED and LOCKED UP!Get link

Also at the meeting with Adelson was his wife, Miriam; Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator who chairs the Republican Jewish Coalition; Corry Bliss, who oversees the super PAC; and Jake Kastan, Ryan's No. 2 political aide. They laid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House.Story Continued BelowAs a federally elected official, Ryan is not permitted to solicit seven-figure political donations. When Ryan (R-Wis.) left the room, Coleman made the ask and secured the $30 million contribution.CLF did not respond to requests for comment. The contribution will become public later this month in the organization's campaign finance filing.Coleman said he would not discuss his dealings with Adelson.Adelson’s donation comes at a perilous moment for House Republicans, who are facing growing headwinds as they try to save their majority. With dozens of incumbents being outraised by emboldened Democratic challengers, desperate party officials have been hoping that Adelson — the party’s most prominent benefactor — would give more than he traditionally does, and earlier in the election cycle.Sign up here for POLITICO HuddleA daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

And the cash comes much earlier in the cycle: In 2016, Adelson gave CLF $10 million in August, as the campaign headed into the homestretch.Party officials have been paying Adelson their respects. In February, a number of House Republicans made their annual sojourn to Las Vegas to attend the annual retreat hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that Adelson helps to fund. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) addressed the conference, and Ryan spoke by teleconference to a meeting of the group’s board.CLF is one part of a two-pronged political organization designed to protect and bolster House Republicans. CLF is a super PAC, and the American Action Network is a nonprofit that boosts center-right policies. Ryan, and John Boehner before him, have backed the groups.	2018/05/10

He reportedly met with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier -- who was foreign minister of Germany when the deal was negotiated. He has also met with French President Emmanuel Macron twice and spoken by phone with European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini.The Globe reported that Kerry was quiet in his campaign as he believes that a high-profile defense of the deal by prominent Democrats would only make Trump more likely to pull the U.S. out of the deal.Kerry’s reported actions immediately sparked criticism and raised claims that such dealings with Iranian and European officials could violate the Logan Act -- which prohibits private citizens from negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government without authorizationWhile no one has ever been successfully prosecuted under the law, the Logan Act was raised last year over former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s negotiations at the United Nations over a resolution with Israel during the Trump transition.“John Kerry helped craft a flaccid deal that granted the terror regime in Tehran vast monetary and geopolitical concessions, even as it put them on the glide path to nuclear weapons by its own terms,” Sohrab Ahmari, senior writer at Commentary magazine, told Fox News. “The biggest public service he can render now is to go away.”Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Kerry’s move “certainly raises Logan Act questions.”He pointed to an alleged double standard, suggesting there would be a bigger outcry if Bush-era Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had done the same during the Obama administration.There was a significant outcry from Democrats and the Obama administration in 2015 when Republicans -- led by Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton -- wrote to Iranian leadership explaining the difference between an executive agreement and a treaty.The letter suggested that any deal without a congressional vote could be modified by a future Congress or revoked with “the stroke of a pen” by whoever replaces President Obama.At that time, Kerry slammed Cotton's move as an “unconstitutional, un-thought-out action by somebody who has been in the United States Senate for 60-something days.""Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Saturday that Kerry is lucky that no one has been prosecuted under the Logan Act or else he could be in trouble.“Fortunately for everybody, the Logan Act [is a] dead letter but if it were in existence, my friend John Kerry would be violating the Logan Act,” Dershowitz said on “Fox & Friends.”Although Kerry would not likely be prosecuted into the Logan Act, Dershowitz said that there are “real problems” with what Kerry is doing.Dershowitz: Mueller probe is treating Trump like mafia bossAlan Dershowitz says Mueller's steam is trying to threaten 'underlings' to get them to 'flip' on the president.“He is negotiating, though he is not in the administration, and there are real problems with doing that,” he continued.According to The Globe, Kerry has also been trying to get Congress on his side by placing dozens of phone calls, including to House Speaker Paul Ryan.Kerry is reported to have coordinated his push with a group of former top State Department advisers who helped negotiate the Iran deal -- named Diplomacy Works. The group has reportedly chosen to focus on Europeans, Israelis and non-partisan experts to try and salvage the deal.“This isn’t President Obama’s agreement. It’s the world’s agreement,” David Wade, a longtime Kerry adviser and advisor to Diplomacy Works, told The Globe . “Maybe Macron, Merkel, and Great Britain can persuade the administration, but if they can’t they’ll be even more essential to protecting the deal absent the United States. We know these voices are powerful. They have an audience with the president and our allies are popular at home.”Diplomacy Works did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.Trump has been critical not only of the Iran deal but also Kerry’s role in negotiating the deal in particular. He has repeatedly called him the “worst negotiator I’ve ever seen.”On Friday, Trump mocked Kerry at the National Rifle Association’s annual conference in Dallas, Texas, describing him as “not the best negotiator we’ve ever seen” and mocking Kerry for breaking his leg during 2015 negotiations.“He never walked away from the table, except to be in that bicycle race where he fell and broke his leg,” he said to cheers from the crowd. “That was the only time.”Adam Shaw is a reporter covering U.S. and European politics for Fox News..

Trump announced Senator Jeff Sessions, who has advised the GOP frontrunner on issues such as trade and immigration and endorsed Mr. Trump on Sunday in Alabama, will serve as Chairman of Mr. Trump's National Security Advisory Committee. Senator Sessions has been on the Armed Services Committee for almost 20 years and is Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.Mr. Trump stated, ""It is an honor to have Jeff as a member of the team. I have such great respect for him and I look forward to working with him on the issues most important to Americans.""Senator Sessions added, ""I am grateful for the opportunity to recommend and facilitate discussions among exceptional and experienced American military and diplomatic leaders to share insight and advice with Donald Trump, regardless of their political views. Mr. Trump and the American people know our country needs a clear-eyed foreign policy rooted in the national interest. We need to understand the limits of our ability to intervene successfully in other nations. It is time for a healthy dose of foreign policy realism. In the Middle East, this means forming partnerships based on shared interests, not merely overthrowing regimes in the dangerous attempt to plant democracies. We must also combat the refugee crisis by creating regional safe zones, rather than depopulating the region by migration. The only path to long-term stability and resolution of this humanitarian crisis for the United States and our European allies is to work towards the safe return of migrants to their home countries, as Mr. Trump has noted. This strategy will also protect our own national security.""Sessions continued, ""A national-interest foreign policy, combined with a military second to none, stands in contrast to interventionist ideas that could enmesh us further in the region's chaos. After over a decade of war and conflict, this country has a host of smart, experienced, and proven leaders. That wisdom must be sought. These meetings will be the beginning of a process that Mr. Trump has called for and which he believes must result in a clear and realistic bipartisan global strategy that will guide our nation for years to come.""Mr. Trump will continue to announce members of his National Security Advisory Committee and other advisors on key issues over the next few weeks.Related ImagesDonald J.

The famous actor, 89, says he’ll be lucky to see 2019:“I’ve had a good run . They say I’m probably gonna be on the list of dead people at the awards show next year. Me and that damned empty chair. Guaranteed. Why can’t folks just let that go?”Eastwood, always in good spirits, says that he’s made a good life for his family and taken care of them with trust funds, homes and large insurance policies and that he’d like to see his personal estate go to something…bigger:“I have been able to sit here in this magnificent ranch watching as President Trump made America great again in just a few months. He’ll persevere through the witch hunt and I will do what I can to make his journey easier.”Eastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest:“We’ll be able to sit up there, far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state and the deep levels of corruption still inside the Justice department and FBI, and strategize without worrying about being called before a federal prosecutor for it.”Clint Eastwood will be remembered for a lot of things after he’s gone, but this may be the biggest.

To support his point, Smith listed several terror attacks that were on the White Houses controversial list, saying Fox News covered them extensively.The presidents assertion is false, Smith argued. The White House knows that it was false or could have known that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth.Smith also brought on Wall Street Journal associate editor John Bussey for an interview to help attack Trump.What theyre saying is not true...Again...Why bother? he asked.This is not the first time Trump has outraged Fox News viewers with his disrespect of the president. In July, he criticized former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for saying all lives matter.After a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, Smith suggested Trump was a fascist.In another segment, he compared Christians opposition to gay marriage to Sharia law.Fans of Fox News have repeatedly called for Smith to be removed from the network.Let me be clear, @starlady24 wrote.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/no-treason-or-bust-for-obama/	No ‘Treason’ or ‘Bust’ for Obama	false	['National', 'false stories', 'Barack Obama']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/us/politics/obama-reaction-trump-election-benjamin-rhodes.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news	2018/06/07	WASHINGTON — Riding in a motorcade in Lima, Peru, shortly after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama was struggling to understand Donald J. Trump’s victory.“What if we were wrong?” he asked aides riding with him in the armored presidential limousine.He had read a column asserting that liberals had forgotten how important identity was to people and had promoted an empty cosmopolitan globalism that made many feel left behind. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Mr. Obama said. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”His aides reassured him that he still would have won had he been able to run for another term and that the next generation had more in common with him than with Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, the first black man elected president, did not seem convinced. “Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” he said.In the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Obama went through multiple emotional stages, according to a new book by his longtime adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes. At times, the departing president took the long view, at other points, he flashed anger. He called Mr. Trump a “cartoon” figure who cared more about his crowd sizes than any particular policy. And he expressed rare self-doubt, wondering whether he had misjudged his own influence on American history.Set to be published next week by Random House, Mr. Rhodes’s memoir, “The World as It Is,” offers a peek into Mr. Obama’s tightly sealed inner sanctum from the perspective of one of the few people who saw him up close through all eight years of his presidency. Few moments shook Mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who had questioned his very birth.Mr. Rhodes served as Mr. Obama’s deputy national security adviser through some of the most consequential points of his presidency, including decisions to authorize the raid that killed Osama bin Laden , send more troops to Afghanistan, pull most troops out of Iraq, restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, seal a nuclear agreement with Iran, intervene militarily in Libya and refuse to intervene militarily in Syria.But his book offers a new window, if only slightly cracked open, into the 44th president’s handling of Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump get elected and the aftermath.In handing over power to someone determined to tear down all he had accomplished, Mr. Obama alluded to “The Godfather” mafia movie: “I feel like Michael Corleone. I almost got out.”Mr. Rhodes describes the reaction of foreign leaders. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan apologized for breaching protocol by meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after the election. Mr. Obama urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to take on a more vocal role defending the values they shared.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama that she felt more obliged to run for another term because of Mr. Trump’s election to defend the liberal international order. When they parted for the final time, Ms. Merkel had a single tear in her eye. “She’s all alone,” Mr. Obama noted.And yet despite criticism even from former advisers to Mr. Obama, Mr. Rhodes offers little sense that the former president thought he could have done more to counter Russian involvement in the election. Mr. Obama had authorized a statement to be issued by intelligence agency leaders a month before the election warning of Russian interference, but was thwarted from doing more because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, refused to go along with a bipartisan statement.Mr. Rhodes called Mr. McConnell’s refusal “staggeringly partisan and unpatriotic.” But Mr. Obama, whose Supreme Court nomination had been blocked by Mr. McConnell for months, seemed less surprised.“What else did you expect from McConnell?” he asked. “He won’t even give us a hearing on Merrick Garland.”Still, in preparatory sessions before meetings with the news media before the election, aides pressed Mr. Obama to respond to criticism that he should speak out more about Russian meddling. “I talk about it every time I’m asked,” he responded. “What else are we going to do? We’ve warned folks.”He noted that Mr. Trump was already claiming that the election would be manipulated if Hillary Clinton won. “If I speak out more, he’ll just say it’s rigged,” Mr. Obama said.Mr. Rhodes writes that neither he nor Mr. Obama knew at that time that there was an F.B.I. investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, despite Mr. Trump’s recent unsubstantiated claims that the departing president placed a “spy” or multiple spies in his campaign.Mr. Rhodes writes he did not learn about the F.B.I. investigation until after leaving office, and then from the news media. Mr. Obama did not impose sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the meddling before the election because he believed it might prompt Moscow into hacking into Election Day vote tabulations. Mr. Obama did impose sanctions after the election but Mr. Rhodes’s suggestion that the targets include President Vladimir V. Putin was rebuffed on the theory that such a move would go too far.Mr. Obama and his team were confident that Mrs. Clinton would win and, like much of the country, were shocked when she did not. “I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have seen it coming,” Mr. Rhodes writes. “Because when you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change.”On election night, Mr. Obama spoke by telephone with Cody Keenan, his chief speechwriter, and Mr. Rhodes to figure out what he should say. Mr. Rhodes asked if he should offer reassurance to allies. “No, I don’t think that I’m the one to tell them that,” the president said.The next day, Mr. Obama focused on cheering up his despondent staff. At one point, he sent a message to Mr. Rhodes saying, “There are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth.”But days later, Mr. Obama seemed less sanguine. “I don’t know,” he told aides. “Maybe this is what people want. I’ve got the economy set up well for him. No facts. No consequences. They can just have a cartoon.”He added that “we’re about to find out just how resilient our institutions are, at home and around the world.”The day Mr. Obama hosted Mr. Trump at the White House after the election seemed surreal. Mr. Trump kept steering the conversation back to the size of his rallies, noting that he and Mr. Obama could draw big crowds, but Mrs. Clinton could not, Mr. Rhodes writes.Afterward, Mr. Obama called a few aides to the Oval Office to ruminate on the encounter. “I’m trying to place him in American history,” he said.“He peddles” bull, Mr. Rhodes answered. “That character has always been part of the American story. You can see it right back to some of the characters in Huckleberry Finn.”“Maybe,” Mr. Obama answered, “that’s the best we can hope for.”Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Book Tells How Election Shook Obama.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/pedophile-advocate-but-not-gop-candidate/	Pedophile Advocate, But Not GOP Candidate	false	['false news', 'Nathan Larson']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180604162031/https://bluestatedaily.com/nathan-larson-gop-pedophile-congress/	2018/06/05	Man Attacked By White Supremacists Now Facing Trumped Up Charges Now We Know What Steve Bannon Really Thinks Of Mike Pence Confused Racists Gathering Of The Clans Coming To Tennessee Facebook Twitter EmailSince the election of Donald Trump, it seems like open season on running for office with shameful sexual tendencies and acts in tow. In December, the president endorsed Roy Moore, an alleged sexual assaulter and pedophile, over Doug Jones, a Democrat who prosecuted members of the KKK responsible for the infamous 16th Street Baptist church bombing. The most recent example is GOP congressional candidate Nathan Larson...who just admitted to being a pedophile to the Huffington Post.On the phone, he was open about his pedophilia and seemingly unfazed about his long odds of attaining government office.A lot of people are tired of political correctness and being constrained by it, he said. People prefer when theres an outsider who doesnt have anything to lose and is willing to say whats on a lot of peoples minds.'To be clear, Larson seems to believe that an aversion to pedophilia constitutes political correctness, but its just correctness. This tactic is one that the president routinely employs suggesting that any opposition to him exists because of moral panics and political correctness, rather than as a cause of his very real shortcomings. Not only does Larson feel comfortable saying this in public, but he also believes that he can (or should) win his race in spite of it.Larson is running for Congress in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white supremacist rally ended with the death of Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, when a white supremacist drove his car into the crowd. And according to his campaign manifesto, he would stick up for people like that...and much worse.In the manifesto, Larson called Nazi leader Adolf Hitler a white supremacist hero.He urged Congress to repeal the Violence Against Women Act, adding, We need to switch to a system that classifies women as property, initially of their fathers and later of their husbands He also showed sympathy for men who identify as involuntary celibates, or incels, suggesting it is unfair that they are forced to pay taxes for schools, welfare, and other support for other mens children.'Nathan Larson, and candidates like him, are the biggest challenge of the post-Trump era. Because if someone isnt ashamed of being a pedophile, what could they possibly be ashamed of?Featured Image Via YouTube Screengrab	2018/06/01
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/05/bezos-didnt-endorse-michelle-obama-for-2020/	Bezos Didn’t Endorse Michelle Obama for 2020	false	['National', 'presidential campaigns', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Michelle Obama']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180529163330/https://yournewswire.com/jeff-bezos-michelle-obama-president/	2018/05/31	Jeff Bezos has given Michelle Obama his full support for a 2020 Presidential run by placing full page Michelle Obama for President ads on the Amazon website.What does Bezos know that we dont?Unz.com reports: And why did Michelle decide to launch her new book on November 13th, 2018, just a week after the midterm elections? Was that merely a coincidence or was the date chosen by her political advisors for some other reason?And what about those rumors that Oprah might run for president in 2020? Were they really triggered by off-the-cuff comments by Seth Meyers at the Golden Globes or was Oprah really just a stalking horse for Candidate Michelle?Theres no doubt that Ms. Obama is wildly popular among liberals and Democrats. According to Gallup, her favorability rating exceeds her husbands or his two predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Check out this blurb from a 2017 Gallup survey: First lady Michelle Obama will leave the White House with the same 68% favorable rating she had when she first moved in. Majorities of Americans have consistently expressed a favorable view of Michelle Obama.... The outgoing first ladys highest rating was 72%, two months into her husbands first term in office. (President Obama Leaves White House With 58% Favorable Rating, Gallup)Michelles popularity makes her the overwhelming favorite to face Trump in the 2020 presidential elections, but will she? She says shes not interested, but Im not buying it. My guess is that she is being coached by the DNC public relations team who want to roll her out like a new box of soap suds sometime after the midterm elections. Isnt that whats really going on? After the ballots are counted, Michelle is going launch her 30-city book tour during which time large throngs of frenzied supporters will spontaneously pop up everywhere demanding that their favorite liberal icon throw her hat in the ring and join the fight against evil Trump. I can almost hear her yielding to their feverish pleas already:I dont want to be president, but I will do it for you, my people.Why Is Amazon Running a Full Page of Michelle Obama for President T-Shirts?What a scam. Democrat leaders obviously know a winner when they see one, which explains why she got $60 million for her new book. Were the publishers really that impressed with her modest talent as a writer or was she being paid for services to be rendered at some future date? It sounds like a payoff to me.Like her husband, Michelle is a thoroughly-reliable political marionette who will play the liberal card to maximum effect while quashing the unions, kowtowing to Wall Street, perpetuating the wars, and ensuring that the bulk of the nations wealth continues to flow upwards to our glorious 1 percent overlords. Its worth noting, that Baracks eight year stint as Prez represented the greatest shift of wealth from middle-to-upper class in the nations 240 year history. I fully expect Michelle to break that record during her upcoming tenure as chief executive.The Democrats arent stupid, they know they need Michelle to beat Trump. Bidens too old, Bernies too liberal and Wall Street wouldnt go near Warren with a 10-foot pole. That leaves Michelle, theyre only hope. Of course, the Dems could change directions altogether, stop playing identity politics, and take a stand on the issues, but no one really expects them to do that. The Democrats have completely abandoned the issues just as they have jettisoned their platform which no one has even referenced in the last 20 years or so. Thats why the party is no longer perceived to have any core convictions, its because the corrupt party leadership merely march in lockstep with their big money constituents. A recent survey in the Washington Post shows how low the Dems have sunk. Heres an excerpt:Some 37 percent say the (Democratic) party currently stands for something, while 52 percent say it mainly stands against Trump. Even among Democrats, over one-quarter say their party primarily stands in opposition to Trump rather than for their own agenda. (Washington Post)The survey confirms what most people already know, that the Dems stand for nothing, its the party of nothing, the Nothing Party. Sure, they hate Trump, but beyond that, they have zilch. Its a terrible indictment of a party that has lost its raison detre.The Democrats are not going to change directions, theyre not going to become an issues-oriented, antiwar, party of the working man. Thats not going to happen. Theyre going to implement the same basic strategy they used with Barack Obama, that is, select a person with impressive oratory skills and great personal charisma, transport him to venues that magnify his popularity, fabricate an aura of celebrity around his uber-positive persona, and make sure he speaks in only the broadest and most nebulous terms. (So he isnt accused of reneging on campaign promises.)This is what the party bigwigs want, a female Obama who will do exactly what shes told and faithfully execute the warmongering imperial agenda without the slightest reservation.Michelle is not only the perfect choice , she also comes with an impeccable resume. She is a Princeton under-grad with a Harvard Law degree. She graduated magna cum laude, top of her class. She has a spotless public service record with virtually no skeletons in the closet. She is a paragon, a shining example of strength, virtue and perseverance, a telegenic colossus who can deliver a barnburner with the best of them, and then, mingle with the little people hoeing weeds in the White House veggie garden. Shes got it all. Shes a black woman whose name recognition and international stature make her the most formidable candidate in the country today, bar none.But the one thing that makes Michelle more attractive than any of the other Democratic candidates, is the fact that she is a proven commodity, a trusted ally who party elites know they can depend on. Michelle Obama is not going to rock the boat, shes not going to try to lift the countrys cast-offs out of poverty, or try to raise living standards for ordinary working people, or put an end the bloody foreign wars.

Dimitrios Pagourtzis. Dimitrios had a Facebook page but it is already deleted. ​Dimitrios Pagourtzis was wearing a jacket with the ANTIFA terrorist hammer-and-sickle emblem. They sell these Antifa stars on Amazon. So the Santa Fe Texas High School shooting looks like an alt-left attack on Americans that has left 10 dead, or this was a Deep State setup to make it look like an alt-Left attack. The obvious evidence however with these emblems on the Santa Fe shooters trench coat does give way that this is a Left-Wing terrorists attack, but the Satanic Star possibly points to this being some kind of human sacrifice ritual. Another thing is that this shooting took place in a small Texas town of Santa Fe with around 13,000 people, which could likely point this attack was carried out to attack kids of Trump supporters. The Left is calling for gun control once again after this event, but the shooter has emblems that indicate this shooting is a Left-Wing terrorist attack to push a political agenda...But the likely scenario is this was carried out to create distraction.

So it was a little strange that when the Oscar winner was asked about her political leanings at a recent event, she went a different route. I dont like the word politics, because I feel like thats the game, she said. Thats the show. I like government.'At a luncheon held in the films honor today at Manhattans Four Seasons restaurant, Bullock alongside co-stars Anthony Mackie and Zoe Kazan participated in a twenty minute chat moderated by NBCs Willie Geist about many aspects of the film. But things really got moving when the conversation skewed more political. When asked by an audience member about how she thinks her character would advise Donald Trumps campaign, Bullock didnt hold back. Unlike her character Calamity Jane Bodine, Bullock said she isnt so interested in the spectacle of politics, and shes particularly disinterested in the performance that Republican presidential candidate Trump is currently putting on.Up till two days ago, I kept saying, Donald Trump needs absolutely no help from anyone, hes already up in the polls, but thats shifted, I think, she said. Secretly, I dont want anyone to be advised, because I want to see who everyone truly is. The thing that makes him so engaging on television is the thing that, you know, might have gotten him derailed. He just says whatever he wants to say, so Im sure the strategist would say, You gotta put a plug in it at some point. Even if you feel that way, dont say it.'Conversely, she added, there is an upside to Trumps unfiltered approach. Im grateful that he says it, so you know who youre dealing with, she said. Im sure someone is coming in to put a little sock in it, going, okay, Donald, just dont' Stop tweeting!, Kazan interrupted. Yes, stop! Bullock laughed.Despite her turn in the film, however, Bullock doesnt fancy herself any kind of expert on political strategy. I could never do this business, I dont have the stomach for it. I would fail miserably, she said.Still, Bullock is optimistic about the future. I like to think that there is still a reason behind the infrastructure that is for the greater good. Albeit, thats naive sometimes, but I believe in the possibility of there being change, Bullock said, citing one recent example: You see what happens to a country and to the world when people of the same sex can get married and love each other legally. That day, you saw so much love, just explode, theres like almost a moment of silence. Later, she tacked on a bipartisan perspective. Whether its Democratic or Republican, moderate or independent, I dont care give me the best person to take care of our country and those who are already here, she said. Thats the person I want.Our Brand is Crisis opens Friday, October 30.READ MORE: Toronto Review: Sandra Bullock Carries Our Brand Is CrisisSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

He proved that once again recently when he violated a Constitutional mandate that you are not allowed to apply a religious test when running for office.The Vermont senator criticized White House Deputy Budget Director nominee Russell Vought for his Christian beliefs in relation to Islam. Sanders declared he would oppose Vought on those grounds, basing his decision on an article Vought wrote in defense of Wheaton College.“This is the fundamental problem,” Vought wrote. “Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned.”“It is hateful,” Sanders said of the writing. “It is Islamophobic. And it is an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world.”Sanders went on to grill Vought, asking him if he believed that the statement in his article was Islamophobic.“Absolutely not. I’m a Christian and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith,” Vought stated. “That post, as I stated in the questionnaire to this committee, was to defend my alma mater, Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith that includes the centrality of Jesus Christ for Salvation.“I understand you are a Christian. But this country is made up of people who are not just — I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people who have different religions in this country and around the world,” Bernie fired back.Vought responded by saying, “As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs.”“I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who is really what this country is supposed to be about,” Sanders concluded. “I will vote no.”Source: http://flashnewsusa.blogspot.mk	2017/11/27
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/rhode-island-tax-returns-bill-didnt-pass/	Rhode Island Tax Returns Bill Didn’t Pass	false	['2020 election', 'tax returns', 'Donald Trump']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180625183513/http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/06/24/state-passes-historic-bill-to-keep-trump-off-the-2020-ballot-trump-prepares-to-sue/	2018/06/26	"Donald Trump promised America that he would release his tax returns if he won the presidency. Were still waiting to see them. Hes lied to this country again and again about releasing his returns, and one state has taken an unprecedented step that could force him to do what hes promised all of us...if he wants to be on their ballot in 2020, that is. Rhode Islands state senate just passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to release five years of their tax returns if they want to be on the states ballot.This picture reminds me of something but I cant put my finger on it. Photographer: Yuri Gripas/BloombergThe Providence Journal reported today that Sen. Gayle Goldin (D), who sponsored the bill, said,Tax returns provide essential information about candidates conflicts of interest. Tax returns are vital information a voter needs to know about a candidate at the ballot box.She also said that every presidential candidate since Nixon had released their tax returns voluntarily until Donald Trump came along. The rest of America thanks her for her effort to fix a problem that could cut out a lot of corruption in Washington D.C. Her bill passed the state senate 34-3 and now goes to the Rhode Island State House.If it passes its going to cause Trump a lot of problems in 2020. Of course hell probably sue over the bill, but if we get lucky and he loses in court, hell either have to release his returns, or he wont be allowed on Rhode Islands ballot. Either way the people of America win. Well either get a look into whats sure to be massive corruption on his part, or hell lose all the votes in one state.That would almost insure that he loses his next election. The way things are going for him now, its very likely that he wouldnt win anyway. Hes quickly becoming the most hated man in the world, and eventually his believers will realize that hes made a fool of them.Featured Image via Getty ImagesLike this:Like Loading...Share this Article!

Today she announced she would not run against incumbent Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter in the midterm elections.Over the last year, Daniels flirted with the idea of running against Vitter in this year's election, but decided to drop the race on Thursday, saying that like Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, she has been the ""target of the cynical stalwarts of the status quo.""""Simply because I did not fit in their mold of what an independent working woman should be, the media and political elite have sought to relegate my sense of civic responsibility to mere sideshow antics,"" Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) said in a statement released today .""They did this not simply for the sake of expediency but because to have a woman of my background challenge the core conscripts of our political and social culture is simply too much for a system that holds that only lawyers and insurance salesmen are qualified to lead,"" she continues.Although a registered Democrat throughout her life, Daniels made headlines last week when she proudly switched parties after learning the Republican National Committee reimbursed an outing at a topless, bondage-themed nightclub .In a statement released April 6, she said, ""It is time again to inspire positive risks and out-of-the-box thinking in the interest of growing a strong economy and a strong America. For me, this spirit can be summed up in the RNC's investment of donor funds at Voyeur.""She added, ""As someone who has worked extensively in both the club and film side of the Adult Entertainment Industry, I know from experience that a mere $1900 outlay at a club with the reputation of Voyeur is a clear indication of a frugal investment with a keen eye toward maximum return.""Daniels began thinking about a political career in 2007 as Vitter was dealing with the fallout from a sex scandal after his phone number surfaced in a Washington prostitution ring.However, Vitter's reelection campaign seems to have been less marred by the scandal than some thought. He recently released a campaign finances report that shows he has more than $5 million on hand as of March 31, with $1.1 million raised and more than $618,000 spent in the first quarter, reports the Associated Press.Daniels also addressed this financial disparity in her statement today.""The simple fact that David Vitter has $5 million in his bank account pretty much says it all. Against that shear accumulation of special interest dollars, I have no legitimate means of winning a race for the United States Senate under these circumstances,"" Daniels said.""I am not running for the US Senate because I am an adult entertainment star. I am not running for the US Senate for the same reason that so many dedicated patriots do not run--I can't afford it, "" she continued.© 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved."	2010/04/15

[ Quiz: Mars Myths and Misconceptions ]Unfortunately, the message ended up giving countless people the wrong impression of what was to be seen in the night sky . The confusion arose from the following passage in the ""Mars Spectacular"" email: ""The encounter will culminate on Aug. 27 when Mars comes to within 34,649,589 miles (55,763,108 kilometers) of Earth and will be (next to the moon) the brightest object in the night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will appear 25.11 arc seconds wide. At a modest 75-power magnification, Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye. Mars will be easy to spot."" Many people, it seems, glossed over the words, ""At a modest 75-power magnification"" — partly because the email featured a line break just after this phrase — and fixated solely on ""Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye"" (without realizing a telescope would be needed to pull of this trick).Of course, the message immediately went viral and was passed on to countless others who couldn't resist forwarding it to their entire address book. Thus, the Mars Hoax was born. [ 7 Biggest Mysteries of Mars ]And ever since, it has been all but impossible to get the proverbial genie back in the bottle.Many suckersThe ""Mars Spectacular"" message was meant to apply only to August 2003, although every year since, during the month of August, the message has resurfaced and has propagated through cyberspace on to many other unsuspecting individuals. It amazes me that the hoax keeps drawing people in 12 years after it first emerged.To give you an idea of just how prevalent the Mars Hoax has become, consider this story:Back on Aug. 27, 2007, one of nature's great sky shows, a total eclipse of the moon , occurred across the United States. On the day before the eclipse, the people who run the ""answer line"" at New York City's Hayden Planetarium expected a heavy volume of phone inquiries from the general public concerning advice on how to view the eclipse. Fifty-one calls were logged that day, but amazingly, only three concerned the upcoming eclipse; the other 48 were calls asking about how to see Mars when it was due to appear as large as the full moon!No planet is more steeped in myth and misconception than Mars. This quiz will reveal how much you really know about some of the goofiest claims about the red planet.0 of 10 questions completeMars Myths & Misconceptions: QuizNo planet is more steeped in myth and misconception than Mars. This quiz will reveal how much you really know about some of the goofiest claims about the red planet.0 ofStart Over | More QuizzesMany fallaciesInterestingly, most of the original email message is substantially correct (for 2003). But there were also a few inaccuracies. For instance, after 2003, the next time that Mars will come closer to Earth will be in 2287, not 60,000 years from now. (The message confusingly implies that both of those figures are accurate.) And the 2003 rendezvous marked the closest Mars had come to Earth in more than 59,000 years, not merely 5,000 years.Furthermore, in 2003, Mars was not the brightest object in the night sky other than the moon. That honor went to Venus . In fact, even at its very brightest, Mars was a full magnitude fainterthan Venus.And even at its brightest, Mars appeared to the naked eye as nothing more than an extremely bright, yellowish-orange star, not at all like the full moon !So if you have already received this infamous Mars email, or if you receive it in the coming days, delete it! In fact, why not take a few moments and forward this column to all those in your address book? Think of it as an antidote to the Mars Hoax virus. So where is Mars now?This month, Mars is much dimmer and far less conspicuous than it was in August 2003. The Red Planet is 239 million miles (385 million km) from Earth, nearly seven times farther away than it was a dozen years ago. And at magnitude +1.7, Mars is about 70 times fainter compared to 2003, so you actually might need binoculars to pick up the planet in the twilight sky. Currently, Mars is very slowly becoming evident in the dawn sky. It is rising 90 minutes before the sun. Search in the east-northeast sky, below the stars Castor and Pollux in Gemini.In terms of actual size, Mars is almost twice as big as the moon — about 4,213 miles (6,780 km) in diameter, compared to 2,160 miles (3,475 km) for the moon. But the great distance between Mars and Earth means that the Red Planet never appears anywhere near as large as the moon in Earth's sky. The average distance of the moon from Earth is 238,000 miles (382,900 km). For Mars to appear to loom as large as the moon does from Earth, it would have to be a mere two Earth-moon distances away, or roughly 476,000 miles (766,000 km).Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/yournewswire-hawks-false-fraud-headline/	YourNewsWire Hawks False Fraud Headline	false	['Puerto Rico', 'false stories', 'Carmen Yulín Cruz']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180718134911/https://yournewswire.com/puerto-rico-mayor-fraud-disaster/	2018/07/20	San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruzs party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the blame Trump narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMAs actions.What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people, Yulin Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled NASTY where did she get it during a major storm? as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy, she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of inefficiency and bureaucracy in Puerto Rico ... but it looks like the islands own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz used a natural disaster to play petty politics and endear herself to US liberals.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja, the AP reported.U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the towns public employees and municipal contractors, the newswire continued.Not only is that illegal, its immoral, Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Velez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Velez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulin Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved, the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, its abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesnt point to Donald Trump ... it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/antifa-crackdown-a-proposal-not-law/	Antifa Crackdown a Proposal, Not Law	false	['Antifa']	https://www.adl.org/	https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/who-are-the-antifa	2018/07/18	Edu Bayer for the New York TimesAntifa: Definition and History:In recent weeks, law enforcement officers across the United States have faced the challenge of keeping the peace at a number of far-right rallies and demonstrations. Their task, to secure both safety and First Amendment rights, has been made more difficult not only by the white supremacists and other bigots who have shown up in Charlottesville , Berkeley and Boston, but also by a relatively small number of counter-protesters who engage in confrontational tactics, including violence, in their opposition to the right-wing extremists. Most recently, the August 27th anti-racist march in Berkeley, attended by thousands of peaceful counter-protesters, turned chaotic when a number of anarchists appeared and allegedly attacked several right-wing or pro-Trump attendees. These violent counter-protesters are often members of the “antifa” (short for “antifascist”), a loose collection of groups, networks and individuals who believe in active, aggressive opposition to far right-wing movements. Their ideology is rooted in the assumption that the Nazi party would never have been able to come to power in Germany if people had more aggressively fought them in the streets in the 1920s and 30s. Most antifa come from the anarchist movement or from the far left, though since Trump’s election, some people with more mainstream political backgrounds have also joined their ranks.These antifa sometimes use a logo with a double flag, usually in black and red. The antifa movement began in the 1960s in Europe, and had reached the US by the end of the 1970s. Most people who show up to counter or oppose white supremacist public events are peaceful demonstrators, but when antifa show up, as they frequently do, they can increase the chances that an event may turn violent. Today, antifa activists focus on harassing right wing extremists both online and in real life. Antifa is not a unified group; it is loose collection of local/regional groups and individuals. Their presence at a protest is intended to intimidate and dissuade racists, but the use of violent measures by some antifa against their adversaries can create a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame. This is why most established civil rights organizations criticize antifa tactics as dangerous and counterproductive.The current political climate increases the chances of violent confrontations at protests and rallies. Antifa have expanded their definition of fascist/fascism to include not just white supremacists and other extremists, but also many conservatives and supporters of President Trump. In Berkeley, for example, some antifa were captured on video harassing Trump supporters with no known extremist connections. Antifa have also falsely characterized some recent right wing rallies as “Nazi” events, even though they were not actually white supremacist in nature. Another concern is the misapplication of the label “antifa” to include all counter-protesters, rather than limiting it to those who proactively seek physical confrontations with their perceived fascist adversaries. It is critical to understand how antifa fit within the larger counter-protest efforts. Doing so allows law enforcement to focus their resources on the minority who engage in violence without curtailing the civil rights of the majority of peaceful individuals who just want their voices to be heard. All forms of antifa violence are problematic. Additionally, violence plays into the “victimhood” narrative of white supremacists and other right-wing extremists and can even be used for recruiting purposes. Images of these “free speech” protesters being beaten by black-clad and bandana-masked antifa provide right wing extremists with a powerful propaganda tool. That said, it is important to reject attempts to claim equivalence between the antifa and the white supremacist groups they oppose. The antifa reject racism but use unacceptable tactics. White supremacists use even more extreme violence to spread their ideologies of hate, to intimidate ethnic minorities, and undermine democratic norms. Right-wing extremists have been one of the largest and most consistent sources of domestic terror incidents in the United States for many years; they have murdered hundreds of people in this country over the last ten years alone. To date, there have not been any known antifa-related murders.Antifa: Scope and Tactics:Today's antifa argue they are the on-the-ground defense against individuals they believe are promoting fascism in the United States. However, antifa, who have many anti-police anarchists in their ranks, can also target law enforcement with both verbal and physical assaults because they believe the police are providing cover for white supremacists. They will sometimes chant against fascism and against law enforcement in the same breath.While some antifa use their fists, other violent tactics include throwing projectiles, including bricks, crowbars, homemade slingshots, metal chains, water bottles, and balloons filled with urine and feces. They have deployed noxious gases, pushed through police barricades, and attempted to exploit any perceived weakness in law enforcement presence.Away from rallies, they also engage in “doxxing,” exposing their adversaries’ identities, addresses, jobs and other private information. This can lead to their opponents being harassed or losing their jobs, among other consequences. Members of the alt right and other right wing extremists have responded with their own doxxing campaigns, and by perpetuating hateful and violent narratives using fake “antifa” social media accounts.Because there is no unifying body for antifa, it is impossible to know how many “members” are currently active. Different localities have antifa populations of different strengths, but antifa are also sometimes willing to travel hundreds of miles to oppose a white supremacist event.	2018/03/31

Theyre now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers, Clinton said in a statement released to reporters by her campaign.Thats outrageous and its just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers ... [I]ts wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.The Associated Press reported that the CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, is the daughter of West Virginias Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.Manchin, a supporter of Clintons presidential campaign, received $60,650 from Mylans PAC and employees, the Washington Post reported.Share this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy	2016/08/25

Kamala Harris: Two decades after Brown v. Board, I was only the second class to integrate at Berkeley public schools. Without that decision, I likely would not have become a lawyer and eventually be elected a Senator from California. That’s the power a Supreme Court Justice holds. There’s just one problem — Everything about that tweet is a lie. Kamala’s parents were successful professionals. Kamala went to school in Berkeley for only 2 years. She then moved with her mother at age seven to Canada where she attended grade school and high school. She claims she was only the second class to integrate at the Berkeley public schools. Kamala lied. Actually the classrooms in Berkeley were already integrated in 1963 — before she was born. Here’s a photo from the 1963 Berkeley yearbook. And here’s a photo from the Berkeley 1964 yearbook — the year Kamala was born.

She is still paying off her student loans. She is 28 years old. “Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a viral campaign video released last month.They certainly weren’t supposed to win.But in a stunning upset Tuesday night that ignited the New York and national political worlds, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx-born community organizer and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, defeated Representative Joseph Crowley , a 19-year incumbent and Queens political stalwart who had not faced a primary challenger in 14 years.Mr. Crowley, who is twice Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s age, is the No. 4 Democrat in the House of Representatives and had been favored to ascend to the speaker’s lectern if Democrats retook the lower chamber this fall.If Ms. Ocasio-Cortez defeats the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in the predominantly Democratic district in November, she would dethrone Elise Stefanik, a Republican representative from upstate New York, as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress (Ms. Stefanik was 30 when she took office in 2015).“I’m an organizer in this community, and I knew living here and being here and seeing and organizing with families here, that it was possible,” a visibly shocked Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview at her victory party on Tuesday. “I knew that it was long odds, and I knew that it was uphill, but I always knew it was possible.”VideoMs. Ocasio-Cortez reacts to her shocking win against the incumbent, Representative Joe Crowley, in the Democratic primary in the 14th Congressional District.Published OnJune 27, 2018[Read more on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s major Democratic upset ]The daughter of a Puerto Rican mother and a Bronx-born father, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez earned a degree in economics and international relations from Boston University but worked as a waitress and bartender after graduating in 2011 to supplement her mother’s income as a house cleaner and bus driver, according to The Intercept . Her father, a small-business owner, had died three years earlier of cancer; after his death, her family fought foreclosure and her mother and grandmother eventually moved to Florida.She dabbled in establishment politics during college, working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on immigration issues, but soon turned her attention to the grass-roots work that would come to define her candidacy.Returning to the Bronx after graduation, she began advocating improved childhood education and literacy, starting a children’s book publishing company that sought to portray her home borough in a positive light, according to a 2012 article in The New York Daily News . The importance of education had been instilled in her from a young age: As a child, she was sent to school in Yorktown in Westchester County because of the dearth of quality schools in the Bronx.She returned to national politics when she worked as an organizer for the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. But even then, the idea of one day seeking office herself seemed unattainable.“I never really saw myself running on my own,” she told New York magazine this month. “I counted out that possibility because I felt that possibility had counted out me. I felt like the only way to effectively run for office is if you had access to a lot of wealth, high social influence, a lot of dynastic power, and I knew that I didn’t have any of those things.”But if Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has, overnight, become the face of progressives’ hopes for ousting not only Republicans but also moderate Democrats who they see as insufficiently outraged about President Trump, her bid against Mr. Crowley predates the anti-Trump backlash that has fueled what many see as a “blue wave” across the country.She has credited her decision to seek office with her experience protesting at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in 2016 against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Soon after, she was contacted by Brand New Congress, a newly formed progressive organization that asked her to run.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who has called for Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, made her underdog status the central pillar of her upstart campaign.In her bid against Mr. Crowley, she was unafraid to foreground race, gender, age and class. When Mr. Crowley sent a Latina surrogate to debate Ms. Ocasio-Cortez last week, citing scheduling conflicts, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez blasted him on Twitter for sending someone with a “slight resemblance to me.” She attacked Mr. Crowley for taking corporate money, for not living in the district and for looking increasingly unlike the constituents of the Bronx and Queens he was elected to represent.“These communities have been so ignored,” she said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this month. “What other leaders or what other choices does this community even have? For me, I just feel like it’s a responsibility to show up for this community.”She has joined activists in Flint, Mich., calling for safe drinking water, and traveled to the Mexican border this past weekend to protest family separations of migrants.Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made her rejection of corporate donations and reliance on small donors a rallying cry for supporters; nearly 70 percent of her campaign funds came from individual contributions under $200 .ImageAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrated with her campaign staff in the Bronx’s Park Billiards & Cafe.CreditDavid Dee Delgado for The New York Times[Our Politics editor is answering readers’ questions about our political coverage. Submit your questions here. ]“Not all Democrats are the same,” she said in her May campaign video, adding — her voice rising with emotion — that a Democrat who “doesn’t send his kids to our schools, doesn’t drink our water or breathe our air cannot possibly represent us.”“Congress is too old,” she told a reporter from the website Elite Daily . “They don’t have a stake in the game.”Before Tuesday’s victory catapulted her to the front of the political conversation, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez seemed to find readier audiences with outlets such as Elite Daily, Mic or Refinery29 — websites most often associated with millennial and female audiences — than with traditional publications.That is about to change.“I’m hoping that this is a beginning,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at her victory party on Tuesday. “That we can continue this organizing and continue what we’ve learned.”Still, shock seemed to be the predominant emotion at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s party on Tuesday. “Oh my God, oh my God,” she said as she realized she had won, her hands flying to her mouth and her eyes widening. Throughout the night, as more and more people flooded into the packed Bronx pool hall, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was trailed by a swarm of reporters, supporters and campaign staff clamoring for hugs, selfies or just a glimpse of the woman behind a feat many had considered impossible.She added, “I hope that this reminds us of what the Democratic Party should be about, which is, first and foremost, accountability from the working-class people.”Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the significance of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s potential election to Congress. If Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is elected, she would be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, not the youngest person over all.The article stated incorrectly that Elite Daily, Mic and Refinery29 — popular among millennials and women — were not national outlets. They do, in fact, reach a national audience.Follow Vivian Wang on Twitter: @vwang3 .Shane Goldmacher and John Surico contributed reporting.Related Coverage	2018/06/27

I don’t take offense at that.”“I’m okay. Just win, baby,” she said, misattributing the quote made famous by Davis and his Oakland Raiders to the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, the league’s defending champions who are currently in the midst of a playoff run.Sign up here for POLITICO HuddleA daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.The most prominent example thus far of a Democrat running away from Pelosi and winning came earlier this year in a special election outside Pittsburgh, where Rep. Conor Lamb won in a Congressional district where President Donald Trump won in 2016 by nearly 20 percentage points.Lamb, who has pledged not to support Pelosi for Democratic leadership, appears to be part of a larger trend. The Washington Post reported last week that there are already 10 Democratic candidates for this year’s elections who have made pledges similar to Lamb’s and at least 10 more who have notably declined to express support for Pelosi.Nonetheless, the San Francisco Democrat spoke Tuesday as if she planned to regain her role as House speaker, a position she previously held from 2007 to 2011, should her party win the majority this November. She said she had planned to retire in the wake of a Hillary Clinton victory in 2016 and opted to remain in her role so that there would be “a woman at the table.”Asked about the prospect of impeaching Trump, something some in her caucus have agitated for should Democrats take over the House majority, Pelosi suggested such a step would be divisive. In the absence of something spurring bipartisan calls for impeachment on par with Watergate, Pelosi suggested she would not support impeaching the president and that talk of such a move is a “distraction.”“I’ve just said to folks ‘I wish you wouldn’t.’ You can talk about it in your district. In my district, it’s a very popular issue but it’s not the path that we should go on,” she said. “I’m not walking away from impeachment for political reasons and I’m not walking toward it for political reasons. I just think it’s divisive and I think what we should do is always try to unify.”	2018/05/08
