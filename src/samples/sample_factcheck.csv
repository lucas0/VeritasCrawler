Dan Donovan (R-NY), Rep. Peter King (R-NY), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), and Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.)The bill was introduced in June and has received an enthusiastic push from conservative commentator Mike Cernovich who retweeted Mic reporter Jack Smith IV on Tuesday.Former members of the 'George Soros funded' group claim they were paid $2,000/week and promised free health insurance. © pressAccording to EpochTimes : They called on people to contact their representatives to vote for the bill. A number of local Antifa groups, including the Rose City Antifa, posted their disdain about the proposal on social media.Under the act, anyone wearing a mask who injures, threatens, intimidates, or oppresses people “in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege” will be imprisoned for up to 15 years.The bill’s name makes reference to Antifa, the far-left extremist group that frequently advocates using violence and sparks riots to block conservative speakers and events.Antifa often use black masks and are clad in all black.The bill reads:“Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, while in disguise, including while wearing a mask, injures, oppresses, threatens, or intimidates any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.”Anonymity is a key weapon for cowards. #UnmaskAntifa https://t.co/KWBeS8jOaf— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) July 11, 2018© pressEarlier this month, Portland Police declared a riot after Antifa and right-wing groups clashed, injuring four people.The Portland Police Department said that one police officer was injured with non-serious injuries.The Southern Poverty Law Center in a 1999 article noted that some states have “anti-masking” laws that make it a crime to wear a mask in public.Most of those laws were passed between the 1920s and the 1950s due to violence from the Ku Klux Klan.“Public officials argued that the laws were needed to protect the public from Klan intimidation and violence and that banning masks would aid law enforcement in identifying criminals,” the SPLC said.Share this post:Facebook is heavily censoring information from independent sources.To bypass internet censorship, connect with us directly by enabling our notifications (using the red subscription bell in the bottom right corner) or by subscribing to our free daily newsletter.Get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox for free every day by signing up below.Subscribe to our mailing listEmail Address:"		factcheck
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/05/no-arrests-of-sanctuary-city-leaders/	No Arrests of ‘Sanctuary City’ Leaders	false	['Illegal immigration', 'sanctuary cities', 'Donald Trump', 'Kirstjen Nielsen', 'Thomas Homan']	https://www.whitehouse.gov/	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-joint-comprehensive-plan-action/	2018/05/17	Diplomatic Reception Room2:13 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans: Today, I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror. It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al Qaeda.Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American servicemembers, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens. The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people.No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iran’s nuclear program. This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.In theory, the so-called “Iran deal” was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime. In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime’s nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.In other words, at the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime — and it’s a regime of great terror — many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash — a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasn’t. At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents long concealed by Iran, conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons.The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.In the years since the deal was reached, Iran’s military budget has grown by almost 40 percent, while its economy is doing very badly. After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond.The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time. The deal’s sunset provisions are totally unacceptable. If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.Making matters worse, the deal’s inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating, and don’t even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities.Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime’s development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran’s destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism. Since the agreement, Iran’s bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen.In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated.Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions. I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement.Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East. We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And we will not allow a regime that chants “Death to America” to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.Today’s action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them. In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. Plans are being made. Relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen and, with the help of China, South Korea, and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone.As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran’s ballistic missile program; to stop its terrorist activities worldwide; and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East. In the meantime, powerful sanctions will go into full effect. If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran: The people of America stand with you. It has now been almost 40 years since this dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage. Most of Iran’s 80 million citizens have sadly never known an Iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration of the world.But the future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land. And they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history, and glory to God.Iran’s leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal; they refuse. And that’s fine. I’d probably say the same thing if I was in their position. But the fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.Great things can happen for Iran, and great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the Middle East.There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction. Let it end now.Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.(The presidential memorandum is signed.)Q Mr. President, how does this make America safer? How does this make America safer?THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. This will make America much safer. Thank you very much.Q Is Secretary Pompeo bringing the detainees home?THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Secretary Pompeo is, right now, going to North Korea. He will be there very shortly in a matter of virtual — probably an hour. He’s got meetings set up. We have our meeting scheduled. We have our meeting set. The location is picked — the time and the date. Everything is picked. And we look forward to having a very great success.We think relationships are building with North Korea. We’ll see how it all works out. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. But it can be a great thing for North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the entire world. We hope it all works out.Thank you very much.Q Are the Americans being freed?Q Are the Americans coming home, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: We’ll all soon be finding out. We will soon be finding out. It would be a great thing if they are. We’ll soon be finding out. Thank you very much.END	2018/05/08	factcheck
https://www.factcheck.org/2017/11/trump-didnt-cut-canine-program/	Trump Didn’t Cut Canine Program	false	['National', 'PTSD', 'veterans', 'Veterans Affairs', 'Donald Trump']	https://www.fda.gov/	https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ResourcesforYou/Consumers/ucm345587.htm	2017/11/16	"Parents and Caregivers are Asking Vaccines have contributed to a significant reduction in many childhood infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, measles, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Some infectious diseases, such as polio and smallpox, have been eliminated in the United States due to effective vaccines. It is now rare for children in the United States to experience the devastating and often deadly effects of these diseases that were once common in the United States and other countries with high vaccination coverage.The vast majority of vaccines are given to healthy babies, children and adults; therefore, it is critical that vaccines be demonstrated to be safe and effective. Ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is one of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top priorities. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is the center within FDA that has regulatory oversight of vaccines in the United States assuring the availability of safe and effective vaccines.Because immunization programs of the 20th century were so successful, many of today’s parents have never seen many vaccine-preventable diseases and do not understand the potential for them to re-emerge. If too many individuals choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children, some diseases that are now rare or non-existent in this country may resurface.The viruses and bacteria that cause vaccine-preventable diseases and death still exist and can cause disease in people who are not protected by vaccines. For example, although measles has not been constantly present in the United States since 2000, sporadic cases continue to occur, primarily from unvaccinated visitors who are bringing the disease into the United States from other countries or unvaccinated U.S. travelers returning to the U.S. from countries where measles is still common, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. The United States experienced a large multi-state measles outbreak in December 2014 that started in California and spread to additional states and Mexico. The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated. The initial patients who were confirmed with measles reported visiting two Disneyland Resort Theme Parks in Orange County, California, from December 17 through December 20, 2014. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but it is likely that a traveler (or more than one traveler) who became infected with measles overseas visited one or both of the Disney parks in December during the time that they were infectious.Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and death. Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as measles, serve as a reminder that they are only a plane-ride away and the best way not to get sick is to get vaccinated.topBenefits and RisksA vaccine is a medication. Like any medicine, vaccines have benefits and risks, and although highly effective, no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease or 100 percent safe in all individuals. Most side effects of vaccines are usually minor and short-lived. For example, a person may feel soreness at the injection site or experience a mild fever. Serious vaccine reactions are extremely rare, but they can happen.""Parents should know that the risk of being harmed by a vaccine is significantly smaller than the risk of serious illness from infectious diseases,"" says Marion Gruber, Ph.D., director of the Office of Vaccines Research and Review in CBER. ""Vaccination is a very important step to get children off to a healthy start.""For more information on potential adverse events or reactions, talk with your healthcare provider, and many vaccines also have FDA-approved labeling for the patient that can be a resource of information. It is important to discuss with your healthcare provider any prior reactions to vaccines and any adverse reactions following vaccination.Types of Routinely Administered Vaccines for ChildrenHow vaccines workVaccines work by preparing the body’s immune system for future attacks by a certain disease, caused by either viruses or bacteria. Vaccines contain weakened bacteria or viruses, or parts of bacteria or viruses, and mimic these disease-causing agents (which are called antigens). As a result of vaccination, the body’s immune system thinks the antigens from the vaccine are foreign and shouldn’t be in the body, but the antigens don’t cause disease in the person receiving the vaccine. After receiving the vaccine, if the virus or bacteria that cause the real disease then enters the body in the future, the immune system is prepared and responds quickly and forcefully to attack the disease-causing agent to prevent the person from getting sick. Vaccines are frequently given by injection (a shot), but some are given by mouth and one is sprayed into the nose.There are various types of vaccines that are routinely given to childrenAttenuated (weakened) live viruses- These vaccines contain a live virus that has been weakened during the manufacturing process so that they do not cause the actual disease in the person being vaccinated. However, because they contain a small amount of the weakened live virus, people with weakened immune systems should talk to their healthcare provider before receiving them. Examples include vaccines that prevent chickenpox and rotavirus and measles, mumps and rubella.Inactivated (killed) viruses- These vaccines contain a virus that has been killed so as not to cause disease, but the body still recognizes it and stimulates production of antibodies against the disease. They can be given to individuals with weakened immune systems. Examples include vaccines to prevent polio and hepatitis A.Subunits- In some cases, the entire virus or bacteria is not required for an immune response to prevent disease; just the important parts, a portion or a ""subunit"" of the disease-causing bacteria or virus is needed to provide protection. The vaccine to prevent influenza (the flu) that is given as a shot is an example of a subunit vaccine, because it is made with parts of the influenza virus.Toxoids- Some bacteria cause illness in people by secreting a poison (a toxin). Scientists discovered that weakening the toxins, so that they are “detoxified” does not cause illness. Examples of vaccines that contain toxoids include those to prevent tetanus and diphtheria disease.Recombinant- These vaccines are made by genetic engineering, the process and method of manipulating the genetic material of an organism. An example of this type of vaccine is those that prevent certain diseases caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), such as cervical cancer. In this case, the genes that code for a specific protein from each of the virus types of HPV included in the vaccine are expressed in yeast to create large quantities of the protein. The protein that is produced is purified and then used to make the vaccine. Because the vaccine only contains a protein, and not the entire virus, the vaccine cannot cause the HPV infection. It is the body's immune response to the recombinant protein(s) that then protects against infection by the naturally occurring virus.Polysaccharides- To protect against certain disease-causing bacteria, the main antigens in vaccine are sugar-like substances called polysaccharides; these are purified from the bacteria to make polysaccharide vaccines. However, vaccines composed solely of purified polysaccharides are only effective in older children and adults. Pneumovax 23, a vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease caused by 23 different strains, is an example of a polysaccharide vaccine.Conjugates- Vaccines made only with polysaccharides do not work very well in young children because their immune system has not fully developed. To make vaccines that protect young children against diseases caused by certain bacteria, the polysaccharides are connected to a protein so that the immune system can recognize and respond to the polysaccharide. The protein acts as a “carrier” for the part of the vaccine that will make protective antibodies in the body. Examples of conjugate vaccines include those to prevent invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).Steps to Take When Your Child is VaccinatedReview the vaccine information sheetsThese sheets explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine. Healthcare providers are required by law to provide them.Talk to your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of vaccinesLearn the facts about the benefits and risks of vaccines, along with the potential consequences of not vaccinating against diseases. Some parents and caregivers are surprised to learn that children can be harmed or die of measles, diphtheria, pertussis, and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Conditions to make your healthcare provider aware of before vaccinationThis might include being sick or having a history of certain allergic or other adverse reactions to previous vaccinations or their components. For example, eggs are used to grow many influenza (flu) vaccines; therefore, it is important to inform the healthcare provider if a child is severely allergic to eggs.The packaging of some vaccines that are supplied in vials or prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex, which may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals; therefore, an allergy to latex is helpful to inform healthcare providers of beforehand.It is also particularly important to discuss with your healthcare provider which vaccines should or should not be given to children who have weakened immune systems.Report adverse reactionsAdverse reactions and other problems related to vaccines should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is maintained by FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For a copy of the vaccine reporting form, call 1-800-822-7967, or report online to www.vaers.hhs.govtopRoutinely Administered Vaccines for ChildrenSome of the most commonly administered vaccines are briefly discussed below. A complete list of licensed vaccines in the United States and additional information, such as prescribing information and patient labeling are available at: http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093833.htm .Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed (DTaP)Brand Names: Daptacel and InfanrixWhat it's for: Prevents the bacterial infections diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). This combination vaccine is given as a series in infants and children 6 weeks through 6 years of age, prior to their 7th birthday. Diphtheria can infect the throat, causing a thick covering that can lead to problems with breathing, paralysis, or heart failure. Tetanus can cause painful tightening (spasms) of the muscles, seizures, paralysis, and death. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, has the initial symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe. Eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid coughing followed by the “whooping” sound that gives the disease its common name as they try to inhale. While the coughing fit is occurring, the patient may vomit or turn blue from lack of air. Patients gradually recover over weeks to months.Common side effects may include: Fever, drowsiness, fussiness/irritability, and redness, soreness, or swelling at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has had swelling of the brain within 7 days after a previous dose of vaccine, has a neurologic disorder such as epilepsy, or has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous shot.Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)Brand Names: Adacel and BoostrixWhat it's for: Booster shot for kids at 10 or 11 years of age to prevent the bacterial infections diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). In addition, Boostrix is approved for all individuals 10 years of age and older, (including the elderly). Adacel is approved for use in people ages 10 through 64 years.Common side effects may include: Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, headache, and tiredness.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has had swelling of the brain within 7 days after a previous dose of pertussis vaccine, or any allergic reaction to any vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis diseases.Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Hib)Brand Names: ActHIB, Hiberix, PedvaxHIBWhat it's for: Prevents Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) invasive disease. Before the availability of Hib vaccines, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years of age in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to lasting brain damage and deafness. Hib disease can also cause pneumonia, severe swelling in the throat, infections of the blood, joints, bones, and tissue covering of the heart, as well as death. Both ActHIB and PedvaxHIB are approved for routine administration for infants and children beginning at 2 months and through 5 years of age and 71 months of age respectively; Hiberix is approved for children 6 weeks through the age of 4 (prior to their 5th birthday).Common side effects may include: Fussiness, sleepiness, and soreness, swelling and redness at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, or has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of Hib vaccine.Hepatitis A VaccineBrand Names: Havrix and VaqtaWhat it's for: Prevents disease caused by hepatitis A virus. People infected with hepatitis A may not have any symptoms; and if they do have symptoms, they may feel like that they have a mild ""flu-like"" illness; or they may have jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), tiredness, stomachache, nausea and diarrhea. Young children may not have any symptoms, so when a child’s caregiver becomes sick, that is when it is recognized that the child is infected. Hepatitis A is most often spread by an object contaminated with the feces of a person with hepatitis A, such as when a parent or caregiver does not properly wash his or her hands after changing diapers or cleaning up the stool of an infected person. Both vaccines are approved for use in people 12 months of age and older.Common side effects may include: Soreness and redness at the injection site, and loss of appetite.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately to severely ill, or has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine.Hepatitis B VaccineBrand Names: Engerix-B and Recombivax HBWhat it's for: Prevents infection caused by hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B is spread when body fluid infected with hepatitis B enters the body of a person who is not infected. Hepatitis B can lead to chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), liver cancer, and death. The vaccines are approved for individuals of all ages, including newborns. It is particularly important for those at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus such as a baby born to mom who is infected with the virus.Common side effects may include: Soreness, redness, swelling at injection site, irritability, fever, diarrhea, fatigue/weakness, loss of appetite and headache.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, or has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to yeast or to a previous dose of the vaccine.Human Papillomavirus VaccineBrand Names: Gardasil 9What it's for: Gardasil 9 is for use in females and males ages 9 through 26. It prevents cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers caused by any of the following human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. Overall, Gardasil 9 has the potential to prevent approximately 90% of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers. Gardasil 9 is also approved for the prevention of genital warts caused by types 6 and 11 in both males and females.Common side effects may include: Headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, fainting, and pain, swelling, redness, itchiness or bruising at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The individual has had an allergic reaction to yeast or to a previous dose of the vaccine.Influenza Vaccine (administered with a needle)Brand Names (for children): Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Fluvirin, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone QuadrivalentWhat it's for: Different vaccines are approved for different age groups to prevent influenza disease, caused by the strains of influenza virus that are included in the vaccine.Influenza, commonly called “flu,” is a contagious respiratory virus that can cause mild to severe illness. The elderly, young children and people with certain health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease) are at high risk for serious influenza-related complications. Complications may include pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of certain medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes.The strains of influenza virus that cause disease in people frequently change, so yearly vaccination is needed to provide protection against the influenza viruses likely to cause illness each winter.Common side effects may include: Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, low grade fever, and muscle aches, headache, fatigue and general feeling of being unwell.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has immune system problems, or has had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder that causes severe muscle weakness. Also, tell your healthcare provider about any allergies, including severe allergies to eggs and any allergic reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.Influenza Vaccine, Intranasal (nasal spray)Brand Names (for children): FluMist QuadrivalentWhat it's for: Protects against four different strains of influenza virus included in the vaccine; for children and adults ages 2 through 49 years of age.Common side effects may include: Runny or stuffy nose and cough.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has a weakened immune system, has asthma or recurrent wheezing, or has a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder that causes severe muscle weakness. Also, tell your healthcare provider about any allergies, including severe allergies to eggs and any allergic reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. In addition, because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection, the healthcare provider should be made aware if the child is currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy. Measles, Mumps and Rubella VaccineBrand Name: M-M-R IIWhat it's for: Prevents measles, mumps, and rubella in those 12 months of age and older. Measles is a respiratory disease that causes a skin rash all over the body, and fever, cough and runny nose. Measles can be severe, causing ear infections, pneumonia, seizures, and swelling of the brain. Mumps causes fever, headache, loss of appetite and the well-known sign of swollen cheeks and jaw which is from the swelling of the salivary glands. Rare complications include deafness, meningitis (infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), and painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries. Rubella, also called German Measles, causes fever, a rash, and--mainly in women--can also cause arthritis. Rubella infection during pregnancy can lead to birth defects.Common side effects may include: Fever, mild rash, fainting, headache, dizziness, irritability and burning/stinging, redness, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is ill and has a fever or has ever had an allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or a previous dose of the vaccine, has immune system problems, or cancer, or problems with the blood or lymph system.Meningococcal VaccineBrand Names: Bexsero, Menactra, Menveo, and TrumenbaWhat it's for: Prevents certain types of meningococcal disease, a life-threatening illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis that infects the bloodstream and the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of meningitis in young children. Even with appropriate antibiotics and intensive care, between 10 and 15 percent of people who develop meningococcal disease die from the infection. Another 10 to 20 percent suffer complications such as brain damage or loss of limb or hearing. Bexsero and Trumenba are approved for use in those 10 through 25 years of age to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroup B. Menactra is approved for use in those 9 months through 55 years of age. Menveo is approved for use in those 2 months through 55 years of age. Both Menactra and Menveo prevent meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y and W.Common side effects may include: Tenderness, pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, irritability, headache, fever, tiredness, chills, diarrhea and loss of appetite for a short while.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of meningococcal vaccine or diphtheria toxoid, has a known sensitivity to vaccine components, or a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate VaccineBrand Name: Prevnar 13What it's for: Prevents invasive disease caused by 13 different types of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents ages 6 weeks through 17 years. In infants and children 6 weeks through 5 years of age, it is also approved for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection) caused by 7 different types of the bacterium. Streptococcus pneumonie can cause infections of the blood, middle ear, and the covering of the brain and spinal cord, as well as pneumonia. Prevnar 13 is also approved for adults 18 years of age and older.Common side effects may include: Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, irritability, decreased appetite and fever.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose or component of the vaccine, including diphtheria toxoid (for example, DTaP vaccine).Poliovirus VaccineBrand Name: IpolWhat it's for: Prevents polio in infants as young as 6 weeks of age. Polio is a disease that can cause paralysis or death.Common side effects may include: Redness, hardening and pain at the injection site, fever, irritability, sleepiness, fussiness, and crying.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, including illness with a fever, has ever had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of polio vaccine, any component of the vaccine, or an allergic reaction to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B.Rotavirus VaccineBrand Names: Rotarix and RotaTeqWhat it's for: Prevents gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus infection in infants as young as 6 weeks of age. Rotavirus disease is the leading cause of severe diarrhea and dehydration in infants worldwide. In the United States, the disease occurs more often during the winter. Before rotavirus vaccines were available, most children in the United States were infected with rotavirus before the age of two. In addition, rotavirus resulted in about 55,000-70,000 hospitalizations and 20-60 infant deaths in the United States each year.Common side effects may include: Fussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, fever, and loss of appetite.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child has illness with a fever, a weakened immune system because of a disease, has a blood disorder, any type of cancer, has gastrointestinal problems, has had stomach surgery or ever had intussusception, which is a form of blockage of the intestines, is allergic to any of the ingredients of the vaccine, or has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine, or has regular close contact with a member of a family or household who has a weak immune system.Varicella Virus VaccineBrand Name: VarivaxWhat it's for: Prevents varicella (chickenpox) in children 12 months of age and older. Chickenpox usually causes a blister-like itchy rash, tiredness, headache and fever. It can be serious, particularly in babies, adolescents, adults and people with weak immune systems, causing less common, but more serious complications such as skin infection, scarring, pneumonia, brain swelling, Reye's syndrome, (which affects the liver and brain), and death.Common side effects may include: Soreness, pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, fever, irritability, and chicken-pox like rash on the body or at the site of the shot.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, including a fever, has a weak immune system, has received a blood or plasma transfusion or immune globulin within the last 5 months, takes any medicines, has allergies including any life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or a previous dose of chickenpox or any other vaccine.Your healthcare provider may decide to use the following vaccines to prevent the diseases described previously. These are also approved by FDA and could reduce the total number of shots a child receives.Brand Name: KinrixWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio in children 4 through 6 years of age (prior to 7th birthday).Common side effects: Similar to those vaccines described previously for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio.Brand Name: PediarixWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio in children 6 weeks of age through 6 years of age (prior to the 7th birthday).Common side effects: Similar to those vaccines described previously for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio.Brand Name: PentacelWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and invasive Hib disease in children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (prior to 5th birthday).Common Side Effects: Similar to those vaccines described previously for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib.Brand Name: ProQuadWhat it’s for: Prevents measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and varicella (chicken pox) in children 12 months through 12 years of age.Common side effects: Fever, measles-like rash and injection site reactions such as pain, tenderness, soreness, redness and swelling.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox.Brand Name: QuadracelWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio in children 4 through 6 years of age.Common side effects: muscle aches, fever and injection site reactions such as pain, swelling and rednessTell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio.Parents and Caregivers are AskingShould I be worried about the increasing number of vaccines recommended for children?No. Because of advances in science and manufacturing, it is easier than in the past to be sure that vaccines are highly pure. Vaccines represent only a minor stimulation of the infant immune system compared to the large number of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses babies routinely encounter: starting immediately after a baby is born; thousands of different bacteria begin to live on the skin and the lining of the nose, throat, and intestines. The baby’s immune system rapidly launches immune responses to these bacteria that prevent them from invading the blood stream.Are the ingredients that are used to make vaccines safe?Yes. Each ingredient in a vaccine is included for a reason. Before FDA determines that a vaccine is safe and effective and licenses it for use by the public in the United States, the vaccine is carefully evaluated by FDA scientists and doctors, taking into account the ingredients that make up the entire vaccine.Are vaccines linked to autism?No, the scientific evidence does not support a link between vaccination and autism or other developmental disorders."	2013/07/01	factcheck

Some Say It’s One for a Woman.ImageThe resignation of Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, amid allegations of violence against women has roiled the state’s political circles.CreditCreditFrank Franklin Ii/Associated PressBy Vivian WangMay 8, 2018As New York’s state legislators huddle behind closed doors to select a temporary replacement for the disgraced former attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman, they will be choosing more than just a six-month placeholder for the state’s top legal job.They may also be deciding the future of the outsize responsibility Mr. Schneiderman seemed to envision for the position — a responsibility he treated as not merely enforcing the state’s laws, but defying President Trump and safeguarding democratic ideals.In the wake of Mr. Schneiderman’s stunning resignation Monday night after four women accused him in The New Yorker of physical abuse, whoever replaces him will immediately step into a high-profile, almost celebrity role. As a result, the race to replace him has taken on a significance, and drawn a level of attention, usually reserved more for general elections than for a half-year holdover position, the kind that might normally be bestowed quietly as a résumé ornament upon a longtime political loyalist.Already on Tuesday, elected officials were discussing the symbolism of the role, suggesting that they would like to see a woman, perhaps a woman of color, hold the office for the first time.“The attorney general is a very important position. It’s even more important today, in some ways, because of what’s going on in Washington,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at an unrelated news conference.“I think a qualified woman would be great, especially in this time,” he added.The New Yorker reported that Mr. Schneiderman slapped, choked or spat on at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved. The horrific accusations included alcohol-fueled rages, racist remarks and threats to kill the women or to use his power as the state’s top law enforcement officer against them if they defied him.By Tuesday afternoon, Letitia James, New York City’s public advocate, had emerged as a possible front-runner, according to legislators familiar with the discussions. Under state law, the vacancy will be filled by a joint vote of the State Assembly and the State Legislature, effectively leaving the decision to Assembly Democrats, who comprise a formidable majority of the 213-member Legislature.Ms. James, who is black, served as an assistant attorney general and public defender before being elected in 2014 to the public advocate position, where she acts as a watchdog over city agencies. She has railed against Mr. Trump’s policies and has advocated for gender pay equity and criminal justice reform.ImageNew York’s solicitor general, Barbara D. Underwood, will lead the attorney general’s office until a replacement for Mr. Schneiderman is found.CreditOffice of the New York State Attorney GeneralReached by telephone, Ms. James declined to comment. Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said no decision was imminent, though he said that he expected to finalize details on a process for vetting candidates soon. But he told reporters that “diversity does matter.” Two other sources with knowledge of the Assembly Democrats’ discussions said there was general support for elevating a woman to the role.For now, at least, a woman will lead the office: The state solicitor general, Barbara D. Underwood, will assume Mr. Schneiderman’s position until the Legislature chooses a successor. In a statement, Ms. Underwood called the office’s work “critically important.”“Our office has never been stronger,” she said.Ms. Underwood, a graduate of Harvard and Georgetown, has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court and served as a clerk for former Justice Thurgood Marshall. She is the first woman to occupy the office.Regardless of whom the Legislature selects as an interim attorney general, the race will be reopened in the fall for a general election in November. Whoever wins the next four-year term will be closely watched not only in New York but also nationwide, as he or she decides whether to double down on the legal gauntlet Mr. Schneiderman threw down for Mr. Trump. As attorney general, Mr. Schneiderman filed more than 100 legal or administrative actions against Republicans in Washington, sued the Weinstein Company over potential civil rights violations, and moved to change state law so that he could prosecute President Trump’s aides even if he pardoned them.Already, the list of possible contenders is long and growing.It includes Kathleen Rice, a United States representative from Long Island who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Schneiderman in the 2010 Democratic primary; Alphonso David, Mr. Cuomo’s chief counsel; Michael Gianaris, a state senator from Queens and chief political strategist for the Democratic conference; Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham Law School professor who ran for governor in 2014; Carrie H. Cohen, a former federal prosecutor who handled the corruption trial of the former Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver; Representative Sean Patrick Maloney; and Benjamin Lawsky, formerly the state’s top financial regulator.In a possible sign of the elevated visibility of the attorney general’s role, some of the other names that have been floated seemed more like a liberal wish list than a viable ballot lineup: Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney from Manhattan whose feud with Mr. Trump may have outdone Mr. Schneiderman’s, for example — or even Hillary Clinton. (Asked on CNN on Tuesday about the possibility of a bid for the position, Mr. Bharara did not outright dismiss the idea.)None except Ms. Teachout has publicly expressed interest. Ms. Teachout said on Tuesday that she was “seriously considering running.” Press aides for Ms. Rice and Mr. Maloney both declined to comment, but sources familiar with their thinking each said they were seriously mulling a run. Both are already financially well positioned to launch a bid: Ms. Rice and Mr. Maloney each has more than $1.5 million in campaign cash on hand, as does Mr. Gianaris.For all the political jockeying, women’s advocacy groups said the succession debate should remain focused on the heart of the attorney general’s role: its core legal responsibilities.“We’re going to have more and more of these cases” of alleged sexual harassment or violence, said Sonia Ossorio, president of New York’s arm of the National Organization for Women, citing the strength of the #MeToo movement. “This role of being the top law enforcement officer in an era where we still have a great deal of discrimination and violence against women — we need someone who can really prioritize that.”Follow Vivian Wang on Twitter: @vwang3J.

By requiring Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates to disclose their five most recent federal tax returns in order to qualify for the ballot, the ACLU testified , this legislation set a dangerous precedent. The ACLU of RI has long objected to legislative efforts to impose additional qualifications on candidates to qualify for the ballot, and it is especially problematic for states to do so in the context of federal campaigns. Just as the legislature should refrain from setting unnecessary barriers in the way for people to vote, it should not add unnecessary obstacles to get on the ballot. The Senate approved this legislation in June, but it died in the House.In this section:		factcheck

""We are devastated,"" she said.Later in the day, Variety published a story containing additional sexual harassment allegations against Lauer. The story cited accounts from three unnamed women.The publication also included allegations that NBC News protected Lauer, citing several woman and saying ""they complained to executives at the network about Lauer's behavior, which fell on deaf ears given the lucrative advertising surrounding 'Today.'""CNN has not independently confirmed the charges. And Lauer has not commented.""We can say unequivocally, that, prior to Monday night, current NBC News management was never made aware of any complaints about Matt Lauer's conduct,"" an NBC spokesperson told CNN in the wake of the Variety story.Lauer's sudden ouster came as a shock to viewers -- but not as a complete surprise to his ""Today"" show colleagues. They knew that Variety and other news outlets were investigating Lauer's off-camera conduct.One of those outlets, The New York Times , was in touch with an accuser who then met with NBC lawyers and human resources officials on Monday evening.The accuser's attorney, Ari Wilkenfeld, said it was a three-hour-long meeting.""My client detailed egregious acts of sexual harassment and misconduct by Mr. Lauer,"" Wilkenfeld said.An investigation ensued on Tuesday. A decision was made to terminate his employment on Tuesday evening -- a swift turnaround time.Related: Ann Curry fans see karma in Matt Lauer's firingNBC News chairman Andrew Lack, a close friend of Lauer's, called and talked with him, according to a source with knowledge of the process.Lack told staffers on Wednesday morning that Lauer was accepting of the decision and expressed remorse, the source said.The details of the woman's complaint have not been made public. But Lack said in a memo to staff that ""it represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company's standards.""The source said the woman alleged that the inappropriate behavior began while Lauer was in Russia covering the Winter Olympics in 2014.An NBC News spokeswoman declined to comment.Lack's memo said it was the first complaint lodged against Lauer in his career at the network. But it also said ""we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.""Lack may have been alluding to the ongoing investigations into Lauer's behavior.Variety reporter Elizabeth Wagmeister said on Twitter that she had been pursuing ""serious sexual harassment allegations against Lauer"" for two months.""NBC was aware"" of the reporting, Wagmeister tweeted. ""There are multiple women we've spoken to with far-ranging accusations against Lauer. The power of journalism has never been more evident with this cultural change.""Lauer's colleagues were visibly shaken up about the firing news on Wednesday's ""Today"" show. Guthrie, his co-host for the past five years, was told overnight about his termination.""We were both woken up with the news kind of predawn,"" Guthrie's co-host Hoda Kotb said. ""And we're trying to process it and make sense of it. And it will take some time for that.""The ""Today"" show is one of the most popular and most profitable franchises on American television. Lauer was the cornerstone of the program for two decades.The network now has to figure out how to replace him at the anchor desk.Lauer is the latest high-profile man in media to be brought down by allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. Just last week, CBS News fired one of its own morning anchors, Charlie Rose , after a report in The Washington Post chronicled years of alleged sexual misconduct on his part.The torrent began when The New York Times and The New Yorker reported on allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein .Since then, actors Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. have been suspended or removed from projects after allegations against them became public. And other prominent journalists, including Mark Halperin of NBC and Michael Oreskes of NPR, have been fired or suspended from their jobs.Earlier this month, NBC News fired Matt Zimmerman, a top talent booker at the network who worked at ""Today,"" over allegations of ""inappropriate conduct.""Zimmerman declined to comment on Wednesday.Related: CBS News and PBS fire Charlie RoseThe firing of Lauer removes one of the most recognizable personalities on television at a time when morning news programs are increasingly important to network news divisions.""This is a sad morning at 'Today' and NBC News,"" Guthrie said at the top of the 7 a.m. hour. ""As I'm sure you can understand, we are devastated. I'm heartbroken for Matt.""Guthrie also said she was heartbroken for the woman who accused Lauer of misconduct, noting ""it's long overdue"" that women feel comfortable coming forward against abusive men.Kotb, on the set with Guthrie, said she has known Lauer for years and ""loved him as a friend and a colleague.""""It's hard to reconcile the man who walks in every day"" with the person who was identified in the complaint, she said.Lauer, 59, was named a co-anchor of ""Today"" in January 1997 after three years as the newsreader.He co-anchored NBC's coverage of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and other historic news events.His contract calls for him to be paid tens of millions a year.

The policemen rapidly found themselves in a perilous situation, being inferior to their attackers in both numbers and firepower.Fortunately for them, 79-year old Wendy Robinson was watching the events from her kitchen window and decided to intervene. The elderly woman equipped herself with her personal bulletproof vest and an AK-47 assault rifle, and ran to the officers rescue, firing more than 160 rounds in the direction of the assailants, injuring two of them.There was ten of twelve of these scumbags, firing with Uzis and shotguns at these two poor officers who had only pistols, so I really had to do something, she says. I got my vest and gun, a few extra clips of ammo, and I went out the house. As soon as I began shooting at them, the look on these thugs face changed and they began to run for their lives. The policemen also seemed really surprised to see me, but they were definitely relieved when they saw I was there to help them.Two of the assailants were injured and were arrested on the site. They were transported to the Martin Luther King community hospital. Their state is considered serious, but doctors dont fear for their lives.Officers Cordova and Cho say they owe their lives to the rapid intervention of Ms. Robinson, and have decided to recommend her for the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom.The LAPD fears the elderly woman could now face some form of retaliation from the criminals, for helping the police and humiliating them, but the threat doesnt seem to bother Ms. Robinson at all.They told me that these punks might try to attack me because of what I did, she told reporters. Well, let them come! I have never been afraid of anyone in my life, and I am not going to start now! These kids think these streets belong to them, but I have been here for 53 years, and I dont intend to leave. I am ready to defend myself and my house, dont worry about me.The sector of the Watts neighbourhood in which Ms. Robinson lives is known to be dominated by a primarily African-American gang known as the Crips.They are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States, with an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members, and have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes.Sharing is caring!Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Related Facebook Prev Article Next Article	2018/05/28	factcheck

Looking at the size of the sock, every one assumed Melania must have left it as a happy birthday gift.Shes had trouble finding her husbands office, the aide clarified.It wasnt long before the signal became clear; Sessions efforts, declared Trump, were no longer required.Thats how Trump does it, said one long-time assistance. He fires people the way his father fired the maid. Hands them an article of clothing and expects them to find the door.Confusion filled the office when an extra-large pair of Fruit of the Loom briefs were found slung over Special Counsel Robert Muellers office chair. Upon inspection, it was determined that the size did not accord with Trumps own undergarments. Mueller has since been allowed to keep his job until adequate support for his brass balls can be found.Advertisements ShareTweetEmailMorePocketTelegramLike this:Like Loading...Related	2017/06/15	factcheck
https://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/no-first-grandma-charges/	No ‘First Grandma’ Charges	false	['National', 'Marian Robinson']	http://www.rollingstone.com/	http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/how-a-fake-newsman-accidentally-helped-trump-win-white-house-w452488	2017/05/09	PrintOut in Phoenix, Arizona, Paul Horner still can’t wrap his mind around it. One day he’s just a 38-year-old Bernie Sanders fan making up fake news and spreading it far and wide on the Internet, hauling in up to $10,000 a month in ad revenue from phony click-bait stories about gang-rape parties in India and the mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation group being arrested at Sea World for getting it on with itself, along with a bunch of political smoke and mirrors. But then, two weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that his particular line of bull, as promulgated mainly through Facebook, may have played a big part in getting Donald Trump elected to the highest office in the land. “I think Trump is in the White House because of me,” Horner told the paper. Suddenly, all hell broke loose and now everyone wants a piece of him. “Inside Edition, CBS News, ABC, the local affiliates, like way more than 60 interview requests,” he reports, adding that he’s decided to not talk to almost anyone until the situation calms down. “I mean, the Tonight Show used that Post quote and was attacking me because of it. But I didn’t mean it like I was trying to get him in the White House,” he says. “I was trying to keep him out of it!”Now, he’s worried and aggrieved. All he did is what he’s done for the past six years, after a career as a coke-snorting, booze-swilling mortgage company owner and a search-engine-optimization expert. Make stuff up, like “Amish in America Commit Their Vote to Donald Trump.” Post it on Facebook. Drive traffic to any of his eight websites, among them abcnews.com.co, so named to make it seem like the real deal. Rake in a bunch of money. And figure that even the stupidest among his readers would soon get the joke.“Most of my stuff,” he says, “starts off, the first paragraph is super legit, the title is super legit, the picture is super legit, but then the story just gets more and more ridiculous and it becomes obvious that none of it is true.” Or at least that any claims ought to be seriously fact checked.Case in point: Last July’s fake story about Ted Cruz saying he would endorse Trump if Trump would make masturbation illegal, with Cruz going on to note that “self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JCPenney catalog tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation.”RelatedWhitey Bulger, Famed Boston Mob Boss, Killed in PrisonThat one got debunked pretty quickly, but others were more subtle. One of the big ones featured a guy named Paul Horner getting paid $3,500 to protest at a Trump rally in early March. (“I’m always a character in my stories,” he says. “People were stealing my shit without credit, so I thought it’d be funny if I put my name in so people would know that Paul Horner was at least involved.”) The piece was filled with slightly nutty details, like how Latinos were only paid $500 to protest, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750 and all of them had to attend a six-hour training class where they were taught chants like “Dump Trump” and “Trump Is a Racist.” But it seemed believable enough that it went viral the same way most of Horner’s stories go viral.“It usually takes a couple of days,” he says. “What I do is what I call ‘re-dating.’ I keep putting it out there, day after day, changing the date of the story to match the current day. That makes it look brand new, like it just happened, which makes it keep going more and more viral.”In the paid-to-protest case, the story hoodwinked Trump’s then-campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski, who tweeted out a link to the post, and Sarah Palin, who cheerfully yalped , “Not even president yet and our guy’s already creating jobs!” This one was soon shot down, too, however, but not before it attained a life of its own, with average-Joe Trump fans latching onto it as gospel proof of Democratic Party dirty tricks.“I was trying to damage Trump’s campaign by writing stuff that was just ridiculous, to make his followers and supporters look like fools,” Horner says. “Everything I wrote mocked Trump. But they just wanted the stories to be true, and instead of making them look like idiots, they just kept on sharing it.”Horner isn’t the only one cranking out fake news. There’s tons of sites – National Report, World News Daily Report, Empire News, Daily Buzz Live, the News Nerd, Huzlers – so many of them that speculation about their influence on an unsuspecting or uncaring public has led to massive public outrage. Just recently, Buzzfeed News ran an analysis of fake news that originated on Facebook during the election and discovered that teens in the small Macedonian town of Veles had been cranking out pro-Trump stories purely as AdSense-generating clickbait – a penny a click – to over 100 fake-news sites, with gotta-be-real names like WorldPoliticus.com and USADailyPolitics.com. Mark Zuckerberg shrugged it off at first , claiming that fake news on Facebook wasn’t a big deal. (Horner, though, says it sends 10 million visitors a month to his various sites.) But then the idea of “fake news” itself went viral, with every media outlet in the world weighing in on the “epidemic” and “scourge” – NPR, the New York Times, the Hindustan Times, all down the line. Finally, Zuckerberg was forced to say that “ we take misinformation seriously ” and that Facebook was looking at ways to combat the problem.Surprisingly, Horner himself is all for a crackdown. His view is that most fake news is fake just for fake’s sake, while his fake news has true satirical merit. “I mean, there’s so many crappy sites out there publishing fake news and just clogging up the Internet,” he moans. “They have no creativity and write with no kind of purpose. If they get rid of a lot of those sites, I think that’s good. I’d love to see those sites go, because I don’t like being lumped in with them.”He goes on, “My favorite story ever, I had this real nerdy white guy in a diner and he starts quoting from Pulp Fiction to stop a robbery, like, ‘Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken but I’m in a transitional period. I don’t wanna kill you, I wanna help you.’ And he’s like, ‘Lucky I had my wallet that said “bad motherfucker” on it.’ Now that’s a good story. It’s been viewed millions and millions and millions of times.”Maybe. But fake news is fake news and, like it or not, he could get caught up in a purge. “I definitely could get banned by Facebook,” he says. “I’ve had it happen before, so I don’t want to push any limits. Right now, I’m just going to lay low.” If only he’d done so before Election Day – but what were the odds of Trump getting elected? “They were like 10 to one,” says Horner, sounding glum about his part in what happened. “Looking back on it, I kept wondering how he got into the White House. But at the time, I didn’t even stop to think I may have been helping him.” Which, in a way, is equivalent to Trump supporters not stopping to think that Horner’s stories might be fake. In a post-fact world, unintended consequences are everywhere, among them Trump’s ascendancy. And did you know that before he leaves office, a super-pissed-off Obama wants to change the name of the country to Fraudland, USA? Absolutely true. It’s been all over the news.	2016/11/29	factcheck

Were able to put in an artistic touch and were able to build, too.Although MCM is owned by five brothers, the top rung of the company is largely female, including several female construction workers. In contrast to Floress statement about prettiness, other engineers might argue that an artistic touch is less important than, say, making sure your structure doesnt collapse and kill people. Fox News reports that both MCM and Figgs, the companies in charge of constructing the bridge, have a record of failures and fines and there is now an accusation that MCM hired incompetent, inexperienced, unskilled or careless employees.The exact cause of the bridge failure is currently under investigation. Floress building philosophy and recent findings about the companies track records may give insight into the deadly collapse. feature image via Palm Beach PostDillon Knight is a student at Central Michigan University and covers Second Amendment issues for DANGEROUS.

Additionally, the organizations applying for matching funds must be located specifically and exclusively within NFL Target Markets, currently listed in the 2012 NFL Grassroots Grant Application and serve low to moderate income areas within those markets.Strong preference is given to those proposals that:Seek to upgrade existing facilities that are in poor condition or otherwise underutilizedDemonstrate active use of the fieldsAttract matching funding that exceeds the minimum required match of 1:1Involve local partnerships with non-profit community partners to promote youth and community programming on the fieldsProvide for continuing maintenance and field safetyAs noted above, applicants may request a maximum of $200,000 from the NFL Grassroots Program to be used for capital improvements. Please review the full application and the below answer for additional details and stipulations for this grant program.How do I know if I qualify for a Grassroots Field Grant?In order to be eligible for the NFL Grassroots Program, organizations applying for grant funds must meet all of the criteria listed below:Be a community-based organization, middle school or high school serving a neighborhood consisting primarily of low to moderate-income families and individuals (schools must demonstrate the ability of the community to also utilize the field);Have at least one-full time staff person (all-volunteer organizations will not be considered);Be in existence for at least three years;Have a proven track record in real estate development and/or parks programming;Have 501(c)(3) tax exempt status/school status; andMy town or youth football league needs a new field but we don’t qualify for a Grassroots Grant, what should we do?Due to the challenges that exist for creating new fields or refurbishing old fields, the NFL Foundation must have strict guidelines for eligibility. If your organization is located in a qualified area but doesn’t necessarily meet all of the additional requirements needed to be eligible for a grant, we recommend contacting local, non-profit organizations in your area that may want to partner with you for the project.I work for a community organization, are there any grants that I can apply for? Does the National Football League Foundation accept requests for event donations, individual grants and auction items?Unfortunately, the NFL Foundation’s guidelines and resources do not allow us to consider personal appeal or any local/regional requests for support. We are a non-profit organization that is mandated to make grants only at a national level through a series of restricted programs and national partners in order to achieve our maximum level of impact.I am an NFL player, who can apply for a grant on my behalf?Current and former NFL players may have third party representatives apply for NFL Foundation grants on their behalf.

Today she announced she would not run against incumbent Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter in the midterm elections.Over the last year, Daniels flirted with the idea of running against Vitter in this year's election, but decided to drop the race on Thursday, saying that like Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, she has been the ""target of the cynical stalwarts of the status quo.""""Simply because I did not fit in their mold of what an independent working woman should be, the media and political elite have sought to relegate my sense of civic responsibility to mere sideshow antics,"" Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) said in a statement released today .""They did this not simply for the sake of expediency but because to have a woman of my background challenge the core conscripts of our political and social culture is simply too much for a system that holds that only lawyers and insurance salesmen are qualified to lead,"" she continues.Although a registered Democrat throughout her life, Daniels made headlines last week when she proudly switched parties after learning the Republican National Committee reimbursed an outing at a topless, bondage-themed nightclub .In a statement released April 6, she said, ""It is time again to inspire positive risks and out-of-the-box thinking in the interest of growing a strong economy and a strong America. For me, this spirit can be summed up in the RNC's investment of donor funds at Voyeur.""She added, ""As someone who has worked extensively in both the club and film side of the Adult Entertainment Industry, I know from experience that a mere $1900 outlay at a club with the reputation of Voyeur is a clear indication of a frugal investment with a keen eye toward maximum return.""Daniels began thinking about a political career in 2007 as Vitter was dealing with the fallout from a sex scandal after his phone number surfaced in a Washington prostitution ring.However, Vitter's reelection campaign seems to have been less marred by the scandal than some thought. He recently released a campaign finances report that shows he has more than $5 million on hand as of March 31, with $1.1 million raised and more than $618,000 spent in the first quarter, reports the Associated Press.Daniels also addressed this financial disparity in her statement today.""The simple fact that David Vitter has $5 million in his bank account pretty much says it all. Against that shear accumulation of special interest dollars, I have no legitimate means of winning a race for the United States Senate under these circumstances,"" Daniels said.""I am not running for the US Senate because I am an adult entertainment star. I am not running for the US Senate for the same reason that so many dedicated patriots do not run--I can't afford it, "" she continued.© 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

They moved to Ohio from Kentucky about year ago because of her job, she said.• Mr. Fields’s father died before he was born, an aunt, Pam Fields, said in an interview on Sunday. Ms. Fields said she had not seen her nephew, whom she remembered as a “very quiet little boy,” more than five times in the past 10 years.• A friend and former neighbor of Ms. Bloom’s in the condominium complex where she lived until last year remembered her son as a quiet teenager who “kept to himself a lot.”“He had some trouble in school making friends,” said the friend, who requested anonymity because she said she feared for her safety.ImageA driver smashed into a line of cars, causing a chain reaction that that killed one person and injured at least 19 others demonstrating against a white nationalist gathering in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.CreditRyan M. Kelly/The Daily Progress, via Associated Press“She had struggled with him during his teen years but he came around towards the end of school,” she said, adding, “She was always trying to do the best for her son.”• In an interview with The Associated Press , Ms. Bloom said she knew her son was going to a rally, but that she tried to “stay out of his political views.” She said that she thought the rally “had something to do with Trump,” adding, “Trump’s not a supremacist.”• Derek Weimer, 45, told The Cincinnati Enquirer that Mr. Fields was one of his students when he taught history at Randall K. Cooper High School. He described Mr. Fields as “a very bright kid but very misguided and disillusioned.”When Mr. Fields was a freshman, he wrote a report for another class that was “very much along the party lines of the neo-Nazi movement,” Mr. Weimer said.“A lot of boys get interested in the Germans and Nazis because they’re interested in World War II,” he said. “But James took it to another level.”• Military records show that Mr. Fields entered the Army on Aug. 18, 2015, around the time his mother wrote on Facebook that he had left for boot camp. Less than four months later, on Dec. 11, his period of active duty concluded. It was not immediately clear why he left the military.• A photographer said he saw Mr. Fields on Saturday with symbols of Vanguard America, a group whose manifesto declares that “a government based in the natural law must not cater to the false notion of equality.” The organization denied any ties to Mr. Fields.ImageJames Alex Fields Jr. in a mugshot released by the Charlottesville, Va., police department.CreditCharlottesville Police Department, via Reuters“The driver of the vehicle that hit counterprotesters today was, in no way, a member of Vanguard America,” the group said in a statement on its Twitter account . “All our members had been safely evacuated by the time of the incident. The shields seen do not denote membership, nor does the white shirt. The shirts were freely handed out to anyone in attendance.”A Violent Crash• Mr. Fields was driving a Dodge Challenger “at a high rate of speed” in downtown Charlottesville at about 1:45 p.m., a spokeswoman for the city said in a statement . He drove the car into a sedan, which hit a minivan that was in front of it.The impact of the crash pushed the sedan and the minivan into a crowd of pedestrians. Mr. Fields fled the scene in the Challenger but was stopped a short time later by the Charlottesville police.• Deia Schlosberg and Conrad Shaw, documentary filmmakers who were in Charlottesville to shoot footage of one of the counterprotesters, were nearby when the car barreled down the street. They said that it hit a number of people before crashing into the other vehicles.“It seemed like it was trying to drive through the crowd,” Ms. Schlosberg said. “The other cars were enveloped in the crowd. I bet those cars saved a ton more lives because it couldn’t keep going.”• The city identified the dead woman as Heather D. Heyer , 32, of Charlottesville.Kevin Williams contributed reporting from Florence, Ky. Susan Beachy contributed research.Related Coverage	2017/08/13	factcheck

We won, but since the system is f***ed up, we lost. I thought, ‘alright. I took in my lesson on this one.” Cyrus stated.She had this to say about Trump fans: “Be that as it may, don’t Trump supporters like the way they think? So I’ve additionally got the chance to open up to the way I approach individuals with my conclusions. That is the best way to roll out genuine improvement.”Last March, Cyrus, promised to leave the United States if Donald Trump won the election. “Truly f*** this crap I am moving if this is my leader!” Cyrus posted on Instagram. Months after the fact, she called Sanders fans who declined to vote in favor of Clinton “f***ing insane.”However then she changed her mind and stayed. In the meeting with Billboard, Cyrus reacted to critics who asked her why she didn’t fulfil her promise to move out of the country: “It’s not time for me to leave now, man. I must be here. I must put this place back together, in light of the fact that I’m from Tennessee — that state [went to] Donald Trump.”“I’m such a visionary, and I know a considerable measure of things that I’ve needed to do individuals said weren’t conceivable,” the LGBT lobbyist stated.The worldwide pop symbol intends to get “very political” with her new music album, “Younger Now,” which includes a song called “Inspired” which she devoted to Hillary Clinton, her political idol. Miley stated that she’s battling for “equality” and “justice” not “hate” and “walls.” However she is not satisfied about her current career status and she is blaming Trump supporters for that. She is not one of the top-selling artists anymore and she is convinced that Trump fans have something to do with that.She stated: “I’m sure that they have something to do with this. The amount of hate that I receive is unbelievable. If this continues I’m gonna leave the US and go to Australia or wherever. I swear. At least while Trump is here. He’s not my President.”What do you think about this? Share this story with your friends and leave your comment below.Facebook Comments	2018/03/08	factcheck

I hope marches like this are a starting point to make a change."" Atlanta police Chief George Turner and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said earlier in the day that people have the right to protest this weekend but urged them to cooperate with law enforcement. Images from local news helicopters showed a peaceful march. The police chief said his officers are being told to stay ""vigilant and professional"" after the Dallas shooting that killed five officers and wounded seven others. A gunman shot the Dallas officers and two civilians during a peaceful protest Thursday night, authorities said.

Numerous state trooper patrol cars and Atlanta Police Department officers blocked an entrance ramp to Interstate 75/85 where a portion of the protesters tried to enter the highway. At one point, protesters jumped onto a semitrailer that had driven into the area. Reed joined the crowd there later and, invoking the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., told protesters he respected their First Amendment rights to protest but wanted to keep them safe, so he would not let them move onto the freeway.

Michelle Obama is no exception to this entitlement mentality either and in some ways, she’s worse as she endlessly travels the globe and expects to be treated like a queen. For eight years, she genuinely thought she was royalty. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her and Barack’s place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved.As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced, the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander-in-Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess. Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend. That didn’t work out so well for the Obamas and they weren’t too happy about it.After weeks of speculation, the royal family has made a decision that’s rightfully in the best interest of the monarchy.The Daily Mail reports:The forthcoming royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was branded a “diplomatic timebomb” if Barack Obama was invited, but not Donald Trump.And now, courtiers are doing their best to defuse the explosive.I hear that Prince Harry, who counts Obama as a friend, won’t ask the former Democrat U.S. President to his nuptials at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May 19.“President Trump will not be invited because the wedding will be for friends and family only,” a source tells me.“It won’t be a state occasion. If Mr. Obama was invited, the invitation could look like a snub to Mr. Trump, and His Royal Highness would not wish to cause a diplomatic row.”Courtiers say such an invitation could further antagonize Republican President Trump who, as the Mail disclosed, canceled a proposed visit to London next month to open the new £750 million U.S. embassy.A senior source suggested Trump called off what would have been his first trip to Britain since he entered office a year ago as he was unhappy about the arrangements and scale of the visit.He was not due to meet the Queen until a full state visit at a later date.Trump’s explanation for the snub was that the embassy’s move from Grosvenor Square in London’s Mayfair district to cheaper Nine Elms, south of the Thames, was a ‘bad deal’ by the Obama administration.When Harry was a guest editor of Radio 4’s Today show last month, he was asked if he would be inviting Obama, who agreed to be interviewed for the programme. ‘I don’t know about that,’ he replied.“We haven’t put the invites or the guest list together yet, so who knows whether he’s going to be invited or not? I wouldn’t want to ruin that surprise.”No doubt, Meghan will have her own views. The U.S. former actress previously described Trump as ‘misogynistic’ and ‘divisive’.Despite practically begging to be invited, the British government is actually begging the royals to refuse the Obamas on their guest list for the much-anticipated wedding set for May 19. The Obamas can thank President Trump for that which will surely not sit well with the entitled pair.The Sun reports:Government mandarins are urging Prince Harry not to invite the Obamas to his wedding for fear of infuriating Donald Trump.Harry and fiancée Meghan Markle have told aides they want the former US president and wife Michelle at their big day on May 19.The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with the Obamas since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.But Britain’s relations with Trump’s White House have sunk to their lowest ebb since his election last year.The property billionaire does not hide his loathing of Mr Obama and is expected to be enraged if his predecessor gets the coveted call up when he won’t.The young Royal couple’s dislike of the new president is well known.Meghan made disparaging comments about him on social media during his election campaign last year.There are deep fears among senior Foreign Office and No10 officials that another perceived national snub will make it impossible for Theresa May to meaningfully engage with Trump.A senior government source said: “Harry has made it clear he wants the Obamas at the wedding, so it’s causing a lot of nervousness.“Trump could react very badly if the Obamas get to a Royal wedding before he has had a chance to meet the Queen.“Conversations are ongoing about and ministers will eventually have to decide. If the PM lays down the law, Harry will just have to suck it up.”As the wedding is not a state occasion, the Government only have a consultative role in its organization and heads of state will not be invited.The guest list is instead being drawn up in full by Buckingham Palace rather than the Department of Culture, Media and Sport – which presides over national events such as state funerals.Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding. The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack’s desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England.According to Page Six , Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the queen so much, she should get a spot.“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”“’What do you do with the queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”It’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.Michelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who’s the real deal. The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too.	2018/01/03	factcheck
https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/fake-mike-pence-abortion-quote/	Fake Mike Pence Abortion Quote	false	['Indiana', 'National', 'abortion', 'Mike Pence']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/E6M7e	2017/09/12	The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception coverage outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women while in fact endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. Gov. Mike Pence signed it Thursday night. The bill is one of those omnibus anti-choice bills Republicans are fond of these days, a giant bill stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all. The sadism of the whole thing is truly breathtaking. Despite the legalistic language, it is as clearly woman-hating in its intent as anything Donald Trump tweets. The bill requires doctors to offer “parents” the “remains” (which in most cases looks mostly like a really heavy period) after the abortion, a clear attempt to make women feel like they are child-killers just because they had a brainless embryo removed from their uterus. In the same vein, doctors are required to do an ultrasound where they try to obtain a heartbeat, just one more bit of anti-choice theater designed to make women feel bad. There’s also a misleadingly named “informed consent” requirement which actually is about feeding women lies to scare them into thinking abortion is dangerous when it is not. On top of the humiliation rituals Indiana requires women to endure, the bill also has an admitting privileges requirement. On its surface, requiring abortion clinics to have transfer agreements with hospitals seems like a good thing, which is why anti-choice forces like this regulation. In reality, however, most hospitals only give privileges to clinics who actually admit a certain number of patients a year. Since abortion is incredibly safe and hospitalization is almost never required, most clinics can’t come up with the minimum number of admissions to get the admitting privileges. States who do this are requiring clinics to meet an impossible standard as a pretext to shut them down. But the provision that is getting the most attention, no doubt because of the sheer sadism of it, is the ban on abortion for race, gender or disability. You can feel the self-satisfied gotcha-style pleasure of conservatives who came up with this one. How can you liberals be against this? It’s a ban on discrimination, and you guys love that stuff! In reality, however, this provision is both deeply racist and misogynist. There’s no real evidence that aborting based on a fetus’s race or gender is a thing that happens. Conservatives believe it, however, based on some ugly urban legends, starting with the unsavory assumption that women of all races would abort rather than give birth to a child of color. The gender provision is also based on a racial stereotype, because it’s based on claims that Asian-American women abort rather than give birth to girls. In reality, there is no evidence that such a thing is going on. “By assuming that because of our culture Asian American and Pacific Islander women will choose to terminate pregnancies based on sex, this law turns AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) women into suspects in their doctor’s offices,” the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum explained in a press release. The part of this provision that gets the most attention is the ban on aborting pregnancies after a doctor determines that the fetus has an anomaly leading to disability. Unlike like race- or gender-based abortions, this is something that happens — a common example is aborting pregnancies after a Down’s syndrome diagnosis — and once again, anti-choicers are hiding behind a supposedly noble cause (protecting the disabled) for no other purpose than to force childbirth on the unwilling. After all, Pence and Indiana Republicans have not expanded services for families with disabled children to go along with this bill forcing childbirth on women. That’s because they are exploiting disabled children as a cover for their true misogynist purpose. If they really cared about the wellbeing of disabled children, they would want them to be provided for. Forcing them on women who don’t have the capacity to raise a disabled child and then refusing to help with the child’s care is not what compassion actually looks like. “I sign this legislation with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families,” Pence said in a statement, after signing a bill designed to wreak havoc on the lives of mothers, their children, and their families. Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented… So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said. A quote circulating on a number of sites further argues that Pence said “if that wasn’t enough, we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction… Because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma. Some versions of the quote have the addition of “Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. This section of the quote has not been verified but the implications of his preceding words clearly point in that direction and imply them. Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. “And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded. Texas’s law, which is currently under consideration by the Supreme Court, is a perfect example of how destructive these laws are to the lives of women and their families. A recent study showed that after the law closed about half the clinics in the state, nearly 4 in 10 Texas women lost access to their local clinic. That meant they had to drive an average 4 times as far to get an abortion, with a quart of those women driving over 139 miles to get an abortion. The result is that women pushed abortions later into their pregnancies and the cost of getting one skyrocketed. Women had to pay for gas, child care and often hotel just get a 15-minute outpatient procedure. To drive home how serious a burden this is: Forty-two percent of women who get abortions live below the poverty line and 61 percent have children. God is going to need to bless these women and their families a lot, because Pence is clearly out to destroy them.	2017/09/11	factcheck

Their task, to secure both safety and First Amendment rights, has been made more difficult not only by the white supremacists and other bigots who have shown up in Charlottesville , Berkeley and Boston, but also by a relatively small number of counter-protesters who engage in confrontational tactics, including violence, in their opposition to the right-wing extremists. Most recently, the August 27th anti-racist march in Berkeley, attended by thousands of peaceful counter-protesters, turned chaotic when a number of anarchists appeared and allegedly attacked several right-wing or pro-Trump attendees. These violent counter-protesters are often members of the “antifa” (short for “antifascist”), a loose collection of groups, networks and individuals who believe in active, aggressive opposition to far right-wing movements. Their ideology is rooted in the assumption that the Nazi party would never have been able to come to power in Germany if people had more aggressively fought them in the streets in the 1920s and 30s. Most antifa come from the anarchist movement or from the far left, though since Trump’s election, some people with more mainstream political backgrounds have also joined their ranks.These antifa sometimes use a logo with a double flag, usually in black and red. The antifa movement began in the 1960s in Europe, and had reached the US by the end of the 1970s. Most people who show up to counter or oppose white supremacist public events are peaceful demonstrators, but when antifa show up, as they frequently do, they can increase the chances that an event may turn violent. Today, antifa activists focus on harassing right wing extremists both online and in real life. Antifa is not a unified group; it is loose collection of local/regional groups and individuals. Their presence at a protest is intended to intimidate and dissuade racists, but the use of violent measures by some antifa against their adversaries can create a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame. This is why most established civil rights organizations criticize antifa tactics as dangerous and counterproductive.The current political climate increases the chances of violent confrontations at protests and rallies. Antifa have expanded their definition of fascist/fascism to include not just white supremacists and other extremists, but also many conservatives and supporters of President Trump. In Berkeley, for example, some antifa were captured on video harassing Trump supporters with no known extremist connections. Antifa have also falsely characterized some recent right wing rallies as “Nazi” events, even though they were not actually white supremacist in nature. Another concern is the misapplication of the label “antifa” to include all counter-protesters, rather than limiting it to those who proactively seek physical confrontations with their perceived fascist adversaries. It is critical to understand how antifa fit within the larger counter-protest efforts. Doing so allows law enforcement to focus their resources on the minority who engage in violence without curtailing the civil rights of the majority of peaceful individuals who just want their voices to be heard. All forms of antifa violence are problematic. Additionally, violence plays into the “victimhood” narrative of white supremacists and other right-wing extremists and can even be used for recruiting purposes. Images of these “free speech” protesters being beaten by black-clad and bandana-masked antifa provide right wing extremists with a powerful propaganda tool. That said, it is important to reject attempts to claim equivalence between the antifa and the white supremacist groups they oppose. The antifa reject racism but use unacceptable tactics. White supremacists use even more extreme violence to spread their ideologies of hate, to intimidate ethnic minorities, and undermine democratic norms. Right-wing extremists have been one of the largest and most consistent sources of domestic terror incidents in the United States for many years; they have murdered hundreds of people in this country over the last ten years alone. To date, there have not been any known antifa-related murders.Antifa: Scope and Tactics:Today's antifa argue they are the on-the-ground defense against individuals they believe are promoting fascism in the United States. However, antifa, who have many anti-police anarchists in their ranks, can also target law enforcement with both verbal and physical assaults because they believe the police are providing cover for white supremacists. They will sometimes chant against fascism and against law enforcement in the same breath.While some antifa use their fists, other violent tactics include throwing projectiles, including bricks, crowbars, homemade slingshots, metal chains, water bottles, and balloons filled with urine and feces. They have deployed noxious gases, pushed through police barricades, and attempted to exploit any perceived weakness in law enforcement presence.Away from rallies, they also engage in “doxxing,” exposing their adversaries’ identities, addresses, jobs and other private information. This can lead to their opponents being harassed or losing their jobs, among other consequences. Members of the alt right and other right wing extremists have responded with their own doxxing campaigns, and by perpetuating hateful and violent narratives using fake “antifa” social media accounts.Because there is no unifying body for antifa, it is impossible to know how many “members” are currently active. Different localities have antifa populations of different strengths, but antifa are also sometimes willing to travel hundreds of miles to oppose a white supremacist event.	2018/03/31	factcheck

Mike Pence of Indiana bans abortions motivated solely by objections to the fetus’s race, gender or disability.CreditCreditChad Ryan/The Journal-Gazette, via Associated PressBy Mitch SmithMarch 24, 2016CHICAGO — Indiana’s governor signed a bill on Thursday that adds broad limits to women’s access to abortions, banning those motivated solely by the mother’s objection to the fetus’s race, gender or disability, and placing new restrictions on doctors.The law , which passed both chambers of the Republican-controlled General Assembly with large majorities, builds on Indiana’s already restrictive abortion rules, and was cheered by anti-abortion groups that had encouraged Gov. Mike Pence to sign it.“We are pleased that our state values life no matter an individual’s potential disability, gender or race,” Mike Fichter, president and chief executive of Indiana Right to Life , said in a statement. “We also believe that the other measures in the bill are positive steps forward for providing dignity and compassion.”The bill is among several limiting abortion that have passed conservative legislatures in recent years, but the sheer number of restrictions in Indiana’s legislation made it distinct.In addition to holding doctors liable if a woman has an abortion solely because of objections to the fetus’s race, sex or a disability, like Down syndrome, the law restricts fetal tissue donation and requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital or to have an agreement with a doctor who does.“Seeing them all in one place, that is very striking,” said Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has been an abortion rights advocate. “It’s like the kitchen sink: Everything that isn’t already in the law. And the law is already really restrictive.”Mr. Pence, a Republican, said he signed the bill because he thinks “that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable — the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn.”The bill, he said in his signing statement, “will ensure the dignified final treatment of the unborn and prohibits abortions that are based only on the unborn child’s sex, race, color, national origin, ancestry or disability, including Down syndrome.”He added, “Some of my most precious moments as governor have been with families of children with disabilities, especially those raising children with Down syndrome.”The measure drew a sharp rebuke from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and other abortion rights groups, and the law returned Indiana to the center of a national debate about social issues.Last year, Mr. Pence signed a religious objections bill perceived by many as antigay, prompting some corporations to threaten to stop doing business in Indiana unless the law was changed. Within days, Mr. Pence signed a so-called fix to that law saying that it did not allow discrimination.Mr. Pence, who had been seen before the religious objections episode as a possible presidential contender, was widely criticized for his handling of the matter. In its aftermath, his political stock plummeted, and he is currently engaged in a re-election race that many expect to be close.Thursday was Mr. Pence’s deadline to act on the abortion bill, and he waited until late in the day to announce his decision.Some abortion rights advocates said that portions of the law could be challenged in court. State Representative Linda Lawson, a Democrat who opposed the measure, said the new law came close to an effective ban on abortions in the state.“They’ve been on a mission, the Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly, to make sure that affordable health care and abortion is no longer available for women in the state of Indiana,” said Ms. Lawson, who suggested that the law was most likely to affect poor women who might not be able to travel to other states to seek abortions.The law could also put some doctors who perform abortions in jeopardy if it is learned that a woman told them that she chose to end her pregnancy because of gender, disabilities or other reasons limited by the law.Many of the provisions in the Indiana law have been enacted previously in at least one other state. Arizona also bans abortion on the basis of race, and North Dakota has outlawed abortions performed because the fetus has a disability.Professor Johnsen said the Indiana legislation was “a clear attempt to interfere and harm and chill doctors’ willingness to perform abortions.”But Dr. Christina Francis, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Fort Wayne, Ind., who works with anti-abortion groups, said that it stopped far short of a ban, and that “a woman can still procure an abortion just because she wants to.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Indiana Governor Signs Abortion Bill With Added Restrictions.

Times artist Paul Schmid illustrates several varieties .America is not a country where the majority of people wrap their skulls in cloth before heading out of the house. Perhaps that explains the current confusion over turbans.In many regions of the globe, swaddling the head in fabric is simply a natural response to the scorching heat and dust. Scholars believe it was an ancient people living under a merciless sun who first invented the turban.But in the wake of recent terrorist attacks, the turban, originally a practical idea for protection, has become a symbol many Americans associate with terrorists.In SeaTac last week, a man was charged with attacking a turban-wearing Sikh cab driver, calling him a ""butcher terrorist."" In Seattle, a man was arrested after he allegedly tried to choke a Sikh, telling him, ""You have no right to attack our country."" In Arizona, a man shot a Sikh gas-station owner to death, later explaining to authorities: ""I'm a patriot.""Hundreds of other assaults on Sikhs have been reported across the country, a trend that strikes many as bizarrely misguided.Yes, Sikhs wear turbans. But they have no connection to the Islamic extremists now wanted by the U.S.Rather, Sikhs are members of the world's fifth-largest religion, which traces its roots to northern India and espouses egalitarianism.President Bush describes the new American enemy as shadowy and hard to find, which may explain why some Americans are grasping for a way to identify terrorists. But equating the ancient headgear with terrorism shows how little is known about turbans.Lesson No. 1: All turbans are not the same. Fabric headwraps and headcoverings are common in a wide swath of the world, from North Africa across the Middle East and into Central Asia. At times, turbans have even been found on the heads of fashion-conscious Europeans and atop the craniums of American pop-culture icons.Like other types of clothing, the turban means different things depending on who is wearing it and how it is worn. To see every turban-wearer as a terrorist is like assuming every person who wears shoes is a criminal.Describing a turbanA turban is a very long and narrow piece of cloth — 12 feet is not an unusual length — made of cotton, silk or synthetics. It is wound around the head and held on by its own tension, gravity or a chin strap.The English word turban is believed to have come from the Persian word dulband — a word which is also thought to be the etymological predecessor of ""tulip"" and of the Spanish word for hammerhead shark, torbandalo.Though no one knows exactly when and where the turban originated, carvings left by the Assyrians, who lived 3,000 years ago in the area that is now Iraq, show turbans on the heads of kings.That means that before there was Islam, or even Christianity, there were turbans.It also means that by 1000 B.C.E., the turban had evolved from a strictly utilitarian piece of clothing into something used to connote nobility and power.The turban is like other pieces of fashion in this way, said Brannon Wheeler, associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Washington.Just as shoes evolved from a practical foot covering into an item of clothing that reveals a person's class and origins, so turbans evolved from a simple head covering into something that identifies people along cultural, religious, political and social lines.Those seem to be distinctions many are unaware of. John Cooksey, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, recently offered this suggestion for weeding out terrorists: ""If I see someone come in and he's got a diaper on his head and a fanbelt wrapped around the diaper on his head, that guy needs to be pulled over and checked.""Cooksey later apologized, saying he was referring only to Osama bin Laden, but clearly the way he described the offending headgear shows a lack of turban savvy. In the picture of bin Laden posted on the FBI's Most Wanted list, the fugitive Saudi millionaire is wearing a white cloth turban wrapped in a circular, spiraling fashion.This is not the type of headcovering that requires what Cooksey called a ""fan belt"" — a thick black cord known to people in the Middle East as an ekal. The ekal is used to hold on a kaffiyeh, the patterned headcovering made famous by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.Kaffiyehs are worn by men in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Persian Gulf states. They are rectangular pieces of cloth folded diagonally and draped over the head. And technically, they're not even turbans.Links to hostage crisisThe American tendency to link turbans with terrorism may stem from the Iran hostage crisis, with its images of Ayatollah Khomeni and his black turban. But in most of the Muslim world, the wearing of a turban symbolizes simply religious or political power.Many Muslim spiritual leaders wear a white turban wrapped around a spherical or conical hat known as a kalansuwa. But, cautioned UW history professor Frank Conlon, ""Not all Muslims wear turbans, and not all people who wear turbans are Muslim.""In the past, emperors and leaders have worn grand turbans with feathers and jewels added as flourishes. Today, in rural regions from North Africa to India, poor farmers and nomadic people of various religions cover their heads with simple turbans, the colors and styles of which sometimes identify them as members of a particular tribe or community.And turbans have uses beyond the obvious. In Morocco, old men have been known to store money in the folds of their turbans. In the desert, turbans are wrapped around the face and used as a protective gauze to keep blowing sand out of the eyes. Before there were police and handcuffs, legend has it that turbans were used to tie up captured enemies.These days, in more cosmopolitan and urban areas of the Middle East, the turban is a bit out of vogue, seen as a relic of the past by young people clamoring for the styles of the West.At the same time, in the U.S., the turban has been embraced among some African Americans, who see it as an Afrocentric fashion. Soul singer Erykah Badu, for example, has often worn a towering turban.Not a good indicatorThe irony of the American focus on turbans in the wake of the terrorist attacks is that, at least in this country, turbans are a very poor predictor of a person's involvement in terrorist violence.""Needless to say,"" said Ellis Goldberg, head of the Middle East studies center at the UW, ""none of [the hijackers] was wearing any type of turban.""Eli Sanders: 206-748-5815 or esanders@seattletimes.com ."	2008/09/26	factcheck

Now, after suing Harvey Weinstein, he faces a #MeToo reckoning of his own.By Jane Mayer and Ronan FarrowMay 7, 2018As Eric Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the #MeToo movement, the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters grew.Illustration by Oliver Munday; Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty (man)Update: Three hours after the publication of this story, Schneiderman resigned from his position. “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time,” he said in a statement. “I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, has long been a liberal Democratic champion of women’s rights, and recently he has become an outspoken figure in the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. As New York State’s highest-ranking law-enforcement officer, Schneiderman, who is sixty-three, has used his authority to take legal action against the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein , and to demand greater compensation for the victims of Weinstein’s alleged sexual crimes. Last month, when the Times and this magazine were awarded a joint Pulitzer Prize for coverage of sexual harassment, Schneiderman issued a congratulatory tweet, praising “the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they had endured at the hands of powerful men.” Without these women, he noted, “there would not be the critical national reckoning under way.”Now Schneiderman is facing a reckoning of his own. As his prominence as a voice against sexual misconduct has risen, so, too, has the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters. They accuse Schneiderman of having subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence. All have been reluctant to speak out, fearing reprisal. But two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, have talked to The New Yorker on the record, because they feel that doing so could protect other women. They allege that he repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent. Manning Barish and Selvaratnam categorize the abuse he inflicted on them as “assault.” They did not report their allegations to the police at the time, but both say that they eventually sought medical attention after having been slapped hard across the ear and face, and also choked. Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman warned her he could have her followed and her phones tapped, and both say that he threatened to kill them if they broke up with him. (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he “never made any of these threats.”)A third former romantic partner of Schneiderman’s told Manning Barish and Selvaratnam that he also repeatedly subjected her to nonconsensual physical violence, but she told them that she is too frightened of him to come forward. (The New Yorker has independently vetted the accounts that they gave of her allegations.) A fourth woman, an attorney who has held prominent positions in the New York legal community, says that Schneiderman made an advance toward her; when she rebuffed him, he slapped her across the face with such force that it left a mark that lingered the next day. She recalls screaming in surprise and pain, and beginning to cry, and says that she felt frightened. She has asked to remain unidentified, but shared a photograph of the injury with The New Yorker.In a statement, Schneiderman said, “In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.”Manning Barish was romantically involved with Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until New Year’s Day in 2015. Selvaratnam was with him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017. Both are articulate, progressive Democratic feminists in their forties who live in Manhattan. They work and socialize in different circles, and although they have become aware of each other’s stories, they have only a few overlapping acquaintances; to this day, they have never spoken to each other. Over the past year, both watched with admiration as other women spoke out about sexual misconduct. But, as Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the #MeToo movement , their anguish and anger grew.In February, four months after the first stories about Weinstein broke, Schneiderman announced that his office was filing a civil-rights suit against him. At a press conference, he denounced Weinstein, saying, “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here.” On May 2nd, at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo, Schneiderman launched an investigation into the past handling of criminal complaints against Weinstein by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr., and the New York City Police Department. (In 2015, Vance declined to bring criminal charges against Weinstein, saying that he lacked sufficient evidence—a decision criticized by activist groups.) In a speech, Cuomo explained that “sexual-assault complaints must be pursued aggressively, and to the fullest extent of the law.” The expanding investigation of the Weinstein case puts Schneiderman at the center of one of the most significant sexual-misconduct cases in recent history.Schneiderman’s activism on behalf of feminist causes has increasingly won him praise from women’s groups. On May 1st, the New York-based National Institute for Reproductive Health honored him as one of three “Champions of Choice” at its annual fund-raising luncheon. Accepting the award, Schneiderman said, “If a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal.” But, as Manning Barish sees it, “you cannot be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, ‘You’re a fucking whore.’ ” She says of Schneiderman’s involvement in the Weinstein investigation, “How can you put a perpetrator in charge of the country’s most important sexual-assault case?” Selvaratnam describes Schneiderman as “a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” figure, and says that seeing him lauded as a supporter of women has made her “feel sick,” adding, “This is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly. But he abuses them privately. He needs to be called out.”Manning Barish notes that many of her friends attended the N.I.R.H. luncheon. “His hypocrisy is epic,” she says. “He’s fooled so many people.” Manning Barish includes herself among them. She says that she met Schneiderman in July, 2013, through mutual friends. She had become a blogger and political activist after opposing her younger brother’s deployment to Iraq and working with groups such as MoveOn.org. Amicably divorced from Chris Barish, a hospitality-industry executive, she was a single mother with a young daughter and socially prominent friends. Schneiderman, who was rising in Democratic politics after being elected attorney general, in 2010, was also divorced. His ex-wife, Jennifer Cunningham, a lobbyist and political strategist at the firm SKDKnickerbocker, currently serves as one of his political consultants. They have a grown daughter.Manning Barish says that she fell quickly for Schneiderman and was happy to be involved with someone who seemed to share her progressive idealism and enjoy her feistiness. Page Six chronicled the romance, calling her a “ravishing redhead” and noting that, at a fund-raiser, the television producer Norman Lear had introduced her as Schneiderman’s “bride-to-be.”But Manning Barish began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior. Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasn’t appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician. The process of having it removed was painful and expensive. In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body. “Taking a strong woman and tearing her to pieces is his jam,” she says.About four weeks after they became physically involved, she says, Schneiderman grew violent. One night, they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment, still clothed but getting ready for bed, and lightly baiting each other. As she recalls it, he called her “a whore,” and she talked back. They had both been drinking, and her recollection of their conversation is blurry, but what happened next remains vivid. Schneiderman, she says, backed her up to the edge of his bed. “All of a sudden, he just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face, landing the blow directly onto my ear,” Manning Barish says. “It was horrendous. It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fibre, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”She finally freed herself and got back on her feet. “I was crying and in shock,” she says. She recalls shouting, “Are you crazy?” To her astonishment, Schneiderman accused her of scratching him. At one point—she can’t remember if it was at this moment or in a later conversation—he told her, “You know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony.”After the incident, Manning Barish left the apartment, telling him that she would never come back. “I want to make it absolutely clear,” she says. “This was under no circumstances a sex game gone wrong. This did not happen while we were having sex. I was fully dressed and remained that way. It was completely unexpected and shocking. I did not consent to physical assault.”In the following days, Manning Barish confided to three close female friends that Schneiderman had hit her. All of them have confirmed this to The New Yorker. “She was distraught,” one of the friends, a high-profile media figure, says. “She was very, very upset. This wasn’t a gentle smack. He clocked her ear. I was shocked.” She notes, “Michelle had mentioned that he drank a lot, and that he changed under the influence of alcohol, but I’d never anticipated that he would be violent.” The friend describes Manning Barish as having seemed “sad” and “torn,” because “she’d really wanted the relationship to work.”The novelist Salman Rushdie, who dated Manning Barish before Schneiderman did, and who has been her close friend for nearly fifteen years, says that she confided in him as well. “She called me and told me he had hit her,” Rushdie recalls. “She was obviously very upset. I was horrified.” In his view, Schneiderman’s behavior does not fall into the kind of gray area that should remain private. “It was clear to me that it crossed a line,” he says. Rushdie, who describes Manning Barish as “a very truthful person, in my experience,” advised her to stay away from Schneiderman.But Manning Barish went back to him, a decision that she regrets. After the attack, she says, Schneiderman “called and called” her. A few days later, on a weekday afternoon, his security detail drove him to her apartment, and he showed up at her door with an armload of flowers and a case of wine. She found the wine surprising, given the fact that alcohol had fuelled his violent behavior. She recalls saying over and over, “You hit me! You hurt me! You should never hit a woman!” But he didn’t want to talk about having hit her. “The hitting was not an issue for him,” she says. Before long, they reconciled.Manning Barish says that her ear bothered her for months. It often felt painful and clogged, and she kept hearing odd gurgling sounds. Once, blood trickled out, reaching her collarbone. Eventually, Manning Barish sought medical help from Dr. Gwen Korovin, an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Manning Barish shared her medical records with The New Yorker. They confirm that, on September 13, 2014, Korovin found and removed “dried bloody crust” from Manning Barish’s ear. Manning Barish thought that the slap might have caused the injury, but when Korovin asked her what had happened she said that she might have injured herself with a Q-tip. “I was protecting Eric,” Manning Barish says. “And I was ashamed. For victims, shame plays a huge role in most of these stories. I want people to know that.” Korovin was asked by The New Yorker if the injury could have been caused by a slap. “Yes, it could be consistent with a slap,” she said. “You could perforate an eardrum in a lot of ways, with a Q-tip or with a slap.”Manning Barish and Schneiderman were together, off and on, for nearly two years. She says that when they had sex he often slapped her across the face without her consent, and that she felt “emotionally battered” by cruel remarks that he made. She says that he criticized how she looked and dressed, and “controlled what I ate.” Manning Barish, who is five feet seven, lost thirty pounds, falling to a hundred and three. In a photograph from the period, she looks emaciated; her hair, she recalls, started to fall out. Nevertheless, he squeezed her legs and called them “chubby.”Manning Barish says that Schneiderman pressed her to consume huge amounts of alcohol. She recalls, “I would come over for dinner. An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter. He had had a head start. ‘Very stressful day,’ he would say.” Sometimes, if she didn’t drink quickly enough, she says, he would “come to me like a baby who wouldn’t eat its food, and hold the glass to my lips while holding my face, and sweetly but forcefully, like a parent, say, ‘Come on, Mimi, drink, drink, drink,’ and essentially force me—at times actually spilling it down my chin and onto my chest.” Schneiderman, she recalls, “would almost always drink two bottles of wine in a night, then bring a bottle of Scotch into the bedroom. He would get absolutely plastered five nights out of seven.” On one occasion, she recalls, “he literally fell on his face in my kitchen, straight down, like a tree falling.” Another evening, he smashed his leg against an open drawer, cutting it so badly that “there was blood all over the place.” She bandaged it, but the next day she went to his office to change the dressing, because the bleeding hadn’t stopped.Manning Barish says that Schneiderman also took prescription tranquillizers, and often asked her to refill a prescription that she had for Xanax, so that he could reserve “about half” the pills for himself. (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he has “never commandeered anyone’s medications.”) Sometimes in bed, she recalls, he would be “shaking me and grabbing my face” while demanding that she repeat such things as “I’m a little whore.” She says that he also told her, “If you ever left me, I’d kill you.”Evan Stark, a forensic social worker and an emeritus professor at Rutgers, is the author of a landmark book, “Coercive Control,” in which he argues that domestic abuse is just as often psychological as it is physical. Abusive men, he writes, often “terrorize” and “control” their partners by demeaning them, particularly about the traits or accomplishments of which they are proudest. Manning Barish says that Schneiderman often mocked her political activism. When she told him of her plan to attend an anti-gun demonstration with various political figures and a group of parents from Sandy Hook Elementary School, he dismissed the effort, calling the demonstrators “losers.” He added, “Go ahead, if it makes you feel better to do your little political things.” When she was using her computer, he’d sometimes say, “Oh, look at little Mimi. So cute—she’s working!” He told Manning Barish that, because she had childcare, she wasn’t “a real single mother.”Manning Barish broke up with Schneiderman a second time, and then got back together with him. He’d been talking about marrying her, she says, and she somehow convinced herself that the real problem between them was her fear of commitment. In January, 2015, she ended the relationship a third time, feeling degraded. After that, they got together romantically a few more times, but since 2016 she has been in touch with him only sporadically.Since the #MeToo movement began, Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms, cheering on women who have spoken out, including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator Al Franken , a widely admired Democrat. Once, she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media, in connection with a political issue. He called her and, in a tone that she describes as “nasty,” said, “Don’t ever write about me. You don’t want to do that.” Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat, just as she took seriously a comment that he’d once made after she objected to him “yanking” her across a street. She recalls saying to him, “Jaywalking is against the law,” and him responding, “I am the law.” Manning Barish says, “If there is a sentence that sums him up, it’s that.”Schneiderman was elected to the New York State Senate in 1998, and served for twelve years. He wrote many laws, including one that created specific penalties for strangulation. He introduced the bill in 2010, after chairing a committee that investigated domestic-violence charges against the former state senator Hiram Monserrate, a Democrat, who was expelled from the legislature after having been convicted of assaulting his girlfriend. During the hearings, the legislators learned that New York State imposed no specific criminal penalty for choking, even though it is a common prelude to domestic-violence homicides. Not only did Schneiderman’s bill make life-threatening strangulation a grave crime; it also criminalized less serious cases involving “an intent to impede breathing” as misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison. “I’m just sorry it took us so long in New York State to do this,” Schneiderman declared at the time. “I think this will save a lot of lives.”Jennifer Friedman, a legal expert on domestic violence, says that she cannot square Schneiderman’s public and private behavior. Anyone knowledgeable about intimate-partner violence, she says, knows that choking is “a known lethality indicator.” She adds, “I cannot fathom that someone who drafted the legislation on strangulation is unfamiliar with such concepts.” She also says, “A slap is not just a slap—it reverberates through the rest of the relationship, making her afraid of setting him off.” She adds, “People aren’t usually prosecuted for it, but, in the state of New York, slapping is assault when it results in pain or physical injury.”In the summer of 2016, the attorney general may have crossed this line again. He went to a party in the Hamptons, where he drank heavily, and invited another guest—a woman he’d known for some time—to join him at an after-party. An accomplished Ivy League-educated lawyer with government experience, she had worked closely with his office in the past, and supported him politically. She says that she agreed to let a man in Schneiderman’s security detail drive them to the next destination. But, when they arrived at the house, there was no party; it was where Schneiderman was staying. The security officer left the property.The lawyer and Schneiderman began making out, but he said things that repelled her. He told the woman, a divorced mother, that professional women with big jobs and children had so many decisions to make that, when it came to sex, they secretly wanted men to take charge. She recalls him saying, “Yeah, you act a certain way and look a certain way, but I know that at heart you are a dirty little slut. You want to be my whore.” He became more sexually aggressive, but she was repulsed by his talk, and pulled away from him. She says that “suddenly—at least, in my mind’s eye—he drew back, and there was a moment where I was, like, ‘What’s happening?’ ” Then, she recalls, “He slapped me across the face hard, twice,” adding, “I was stunned.”Schneiderman hit her so hard, she says, that the blow left a red handprint. “What the fuck did you just do?” she screamed, and started to sob. “I couldn’t believe it,” she recalls. “For a split second, I was scared.” She notes that, in all her years of dating, she has never been in a situation like the one with Schneiderman. “He just really smacked me,” she says.When she told him that she wanted to leave, she recalls, he started to “freak out,” saying that he’d misjudged her. “You’d really be surprised,” he claimed. “A lot of women like it. They don’t always think they like it, but then they do, and they ask for more.” She again demanded to be taken home. They got into his car, and it quickly became apparent how intoxicated he was. As he drove, weaving along back roads, she was terrified that he’d kill not just her but another driver. She says that Schneiderman “broke the law at least once that night.” (“This is untrue,” Schneiderman’s spokesperson said.)The next day, she told two friends, and sent them a photograph of the mark on her face. (Both women corroborate this.) Another photograph of the lawyer, taken later that day at a family birthday party, shows faint raised marks splayed on her cheek. One of the friends says of Schneiderman, “He seemed not to know what the word ‘consent’ means.”Given the woman’s prominence in the legal sphere, Schneiderman’s actions had exposed him to tremendous risk. Yet she took no official action against him. “Now that I know it’s part of a pattern, I think, God, I should have reported it,” she says. “But, back then, I believed that it was a one-time incident. And I thought, He’s a good attorney general, he’s doing good things. I didn’t want to jeopardize that.” She notes that he did not hit her again, after she protested. Nevertheless, she says of the assault, “I knew it was wrong,” adding, “Our top law officer, this guy with a platform for women’s rights, just smacked away so much of what I thought he stood for.”Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of “The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism, and the Reality of the Biological Clock,” which explores infertility issues; she is also an actor and a film producer, as well as a supporter of feminist and progressive social causes. She, too, is divorced. In 2016, she attended the Democratic National Convention, in Philadelphia, where Schneiderman introduced himself to her. She says that their first encounter felt “like kismet.” They had both gone to Harvard: she as an undergraduate and a graduate student, he as a law student. She was impressed when he expressed an interest in meditation and Buddhism. They had both studied Chinese, and, when he asked, in Mandarin, if she spoke the language, she answered, “Wo shuo keshi bu tai liuli”—“Yes, but not fluently.”They began dating, and appeared to be a happy couple. Selvaratnam all but lived in his apartment, attending political functions and dinners with his friends and donors, and brainstorming with him on speeches and projects. But, as she puts it, “it was a fairy tale that became a nightmare.” Although Schneiderman often doted on her, he demanded that she spend more and more time with him, and he began physically abusing her in bed. “The slaps started after we’d gotten to know each other,” she recalls. “It was at first as if he were testing me. Then it got stronger and harder.” Selvaratnam says, “It wasn’t consensual. This wasn’t sexual playacting. This was abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.”When Schneiderman was violent, he often made sexual demands. “He was obsessed with having a threesome, and said it was my job to find a woman,” she says. “He said he’d have nothing to look forward to if I didn’t, and would hit me until I agreed.” (She had no intention of having a threesome.) She recalls, “Sometimes, he’d tell me to call him Master, and he’d slap me until I did.” Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, has dark skin, and she recalls that “he started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’ ”The abuse escalated. Schneiderman not only slapped her across the face, often four or five times, back and forth, with his open hand; he also spat at her and choked her. “He was cutting off my ability to breathe,” she says. Eventually, she says, “we could rarely have sex without him beating me.” In her view, Schneiderman “is a misogynist and a sexual sadist.” She says that she often asked him to stop hurting her, and tried to push him away. At other times, she gave in, rationalizing that she could tolerate the violence if it happened only once a week or so during sex. But “the emotional and verbal abuse started increasing,” she says, and “the belittling and demeaning of me carried over into our nonsexual encounters.” He told her to get plastic surgery to remove scars on her torso that had resulted from an operation to remove cancerous tumors. He criticized her hair and said that she should get breast implants and buy different clothes. He mocked some of her friends as “ditzes,” and, when these women attended a birthday celebration for her, he demanded that she leave just as the cake was arriving. “I began to feel like I was in Hell,” she says.Like Manning Barish, Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman routinely drank heavily—a bottle and a half of wine, or more. He also took sedatives, she says, and pushed her to drink with him, saying, “Drink your bourbon, Turnip”—his nickname for her. In the middle of the night, he staggered through the apartment, as if in a trance. “I’ve never seen anyone that messed up,” she recalls. “It was like sleeping next to a monster.” The next morning, she says, he’d seem fine, but often berated her for not having kept him away from the alcohol. His emotional state seemed to worsen after the 2016 Presidential election. He had counted on forging an ambitious partnership with a White House led by Hillary Clinton . Instead, the Presidency had gone to Donald Trump . Earlier, Schneiderman’s office had sued Trump University for civil fraud, and Trump had countersued Schneiderman personally.On the morning of January 19, 2017, the day before Trump’s Inauguration, Schneiderman called Selvaratnam from a hospital emergency room. She recalls, “He told me that he’d been drinking the night before, and he fell down. He didn’t realize he’d cut himself, and got into bed, and when he woke up he was in a pool of blood.” Selvaratnam rushed to the hospital. Schneiderman had several stitches above his left eye; his face was puffy and bruised. He had her send his press secretary a photograph of the injury, and they agreed to cancel a public appearance. In the image, which was shared with The New Yorker, Schneiderman has a black eye and a bandage across the left side of his forehead. Schneiderman then called Cunningham, his ex-wife and political consultant, and they agreed that he and Selvaratnam should tell anyone who asked about the injury that he had fallen “while running.” (A spokesperson for Schneiderman said, “One morning, Mr. Schneiderman fell in the bathroom while completely sober, hit his head, and had to go the E.R. for stitches. Because he was embarrassed to tell his staff he fell in the bathroom, he told them he fell while running.” Cunningham, in a statement issued shortly after this story was published online, said, “I’ve known Eric for nearly thirty-five years as a husband, father, and friend. These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values, and a loving father. I find it impossible to believe these allegations are true.”)Selvaratnam understands how incomprehensible it may seem that she stayed in such an abusive relationship for more than a year. But, she says, “now I see how independent women get stuck in one.” The physical abuse, she notes, “happens quickly”: “He’s drunk, and you’re naked and at your most vulnerable. It’s so disorienting. You lose a little of who you are.” She kept telling herself that she could help him change, and tried to get him to see a therapist. At times, she blamed herself for his behavior. “I was scared what he might do if I left him,” she says. “He had said he would have to kill me if we broke up, on multiple occasions. He also told me he could have me followed and could tap my phone.”It’s unclear if Schneiderman was serious when he made such remarks, but Selvaratnam says that she felt intimidated. Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, is the author of a danger-assessment checklist that helps authorities gauge the likelihood of homicide in domestic-violence situations. She says, “It’s often true that women don’t know whether to take threats to kill seriously. But we should always take threats seriously. It’s categorized as a violent act, and you can report someone to the police for it.”Selvaratnam began to spend more time apart from Schneiderman, and last fall she ended the relationship. She’d been suffering from ringing in her ears, and sometimes had vertigo. After the breakup, she, like Manning Barish, sought medical help from an ear, nose, and throat specialist. The doctor could find no specific cause for her ailments. The writer Danzy Senna, a close friend of Selvaratnam’s, recalls, “She was thin, fragile, and shaky.” Selvaratnam confided to Senna about the abuse, and Senna was so shocked that she wrote down the details and e-mailed the account to her husband, so that there would be a dated copy of it should any harm come to her friend. Senna’s document, which she shared with The New Yorker, is dated September 16, 2017, and says, in part, “She told me that her boyfriend of a year, Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, has been choking, beating, and threatening her for the entirety of their relationship, and that several times he threatened to have her killed if she ever tried to leave him. She said he knows that she has a lot of really damning information about him, his alcoholism, sexual deviance, and drug use, and she worries about her safety.”Senna advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment. On November 3, 2017, she did so, with another friend—Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer at this magazine. As they carried her things outside, they talked about the fact that Selvaratnam couldn’t possibly be the only woman who had seen this side of Schneiderman. Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated. Selvaratnam knew of one former girlfriend—not Manning Barish—and described where she had worked.The next day, Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend. Gonnerman asked him if he’d ever known anyone who had dated Schneiderman. He said yes: a close friend of his had. Without divulging anything, Gonnerman asked, “So how did that work out?” He answered, “He used to spit on her and slap her during sex.”Gonnerman told Selvaratnam about the other victim. “She was very traumatized,” Gonnerman recalls. “On the one hand, she was relieved to learn it had happened before, but on the other it was, like, ‘Why hasn’t anyone stopped him?’ ”Selvaratnam says, “I wished someone had warned me. And I wondered, Who’s next?” She notes, “I was not planning to come forward, until I found out there was another woman. The silence of women before me meant that I’d suffered, too. I felt, I will not be able to live with myself if I hear of him doing this to another woman years or months from now.”Selvaratnam reached out to the former girlfriend, and they agreed to meet. In February, Selvaratnam recalls, they sat outside on a bench for ninety minutes, and their stories came flooding forth. Selvaratnam says that she was astounded to discover how similar their experiences had been.Selvaratnam kept notes about her exchanges with the former girlfriend, and she described them to The New Yorker. According to these notes, the former girlfriend told Selvaratnam that she had been in love with Schneiderman, but that in bed he had routinely slapped her hard across the ear and the face, as tears rolled down her cheeks. He also choked her and spat at her. Not all the abuse had taken place in a sexual context. She said that Schneiderman had once slapped her during an argument they’d had while getting dressed to go out. The blow left a handprint on her back; the next day, the spot still hurt. When the former girlfriend objected to this mistreatment, he told her that she simply wasn’t “liberated” enough. Just as Schneiderman had done with the other women, he had pushed her to drink with him and to set up a threesome, and he had belittled her work and appearance, saying in her case that she had fat legs and needed Botox.After the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose. She described this response as heartbreaking. And when Schneiderman heard that she had turned against him, she said, he warned her that politics was a tough and personal business, and that she’d better be careful. She told Selvaratnam that she had taken this as a threat.The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she found it “shameless” that Schneiderman was casting himself as a leading supporter of the #MeToo movement. She promised to support Selvaratnam if she spoke out, but she wasn’t sure that she could risk joining her. The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she’d once been so afraid of Schneiderman that she’d written down an extensive account of the abuse, locked the document in a safe-deposit box, and given keys to two friends.In February, the news broke that Rob Porter, a top aide in the Trump White House, was resigning, amid allegations that he’d abused his two ex-wives. One of the women, Colbie Holderness, released a photograph of herself taken after he’d allegedly given her a black eye. The image resonated deeply among the women who had dated Schneiderman. Manning Barish recalls, “After Rob Porter, I was struggling about whether to come forward. I felt guilt and shame that I was encouraging other women to speak out but wasn’t doing the same. I was a hypocrite. I was in tears.” Her friends told her that she risked becoming known mainly for being Schneiderman’s victim, and she initially agreed to let the matter go. But, after thinking it over, she told them, “If he’s done this to more than one woman, I’m going to say something.”After Porter’s resignation, Selvaratnam felt more determined than ever to speak out about Schneiderman and the broader issue of intimate-partner violence. As this story was being reported, Manning Barish became aware that there were other victims, and decided that she had three choices: “I can lie. I can be silent, which is being complicit, and a betrayal of the other women. Or I can tell the truth.” She concluded, “I’m choosing No. 3.” Manning Barish is aware of the risks faced by women who take on powerful politicians, and isn’t relishing the prospect of taking on the attorney general. “It’s hard,” she says. “It affects your life, and not in a positive way.”Selvaratnam says that she considered filing an ethics complaint against Schneiderman, or bringing a civil suit, but the various legal options she considered were always connected to Schneiderman in some way. Meanwhile, at least eight members of Congress had resigned, or announced plans to retire, after being accused of sexual misconduct. In Missouri, the legislature called a special session to take up the impeachment of Governor Eric Greitens, who had been accused of slapping, restraining, and belittling a woman during an affair. Greitens has denied the allegations, but he is facing a felony charge stemming from the woman’s assertion that he took compromising photographs of her, in an effort to stop her from speaking out.Selvaratnam, by contrast, feels caught up in circumstances that have given her only one real choice: to go public. “It’s torturous for me to do this,” she says. “I like my life.” Of this article, she says, “I wish my name did not have to be in it,” and notes, of Schneiderman, “I know it’s going to be my word against his, because I don’t have photos of bruises, and I don’t have a police report.” Schneiderman’s accusers, she feels, are in an unusually difficult situation. As she puts it, “What do you do if your abuser is the top law-enforcement official in the state?”Jane Mayer has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1995.Read more »Ronan Farrow is a contributing writer to The New Yorker and a television anchor and investigative reporter whose work also appears on HBO.

You see judge shopping, he complained after a recent decision. [T]hey immediately run to the Ninth Circuit . . . Its got close to an 80 percent reversal period [sic]. The president appears to have glommed on to a favorite conservative talking pointgetting rid of the Ninth circuitwith little apparent understanding of what it would accomplish.The nine-state, two-territory Ninth circuit stretches north from Arizona through Montana to Alaska and west to the coast and out to Hawaii and two Pacific territories. It has 15 district courts and a 29 judgeship court of appeals, 12 more than the next largest court. Trumps 80 percent reversal period [sic] reference suggests that his main object is the court of appeals, even though that outburst followed a district judges decision. In any event, others (e.g., here, here, and here) have put the 80% claim into context. As to criticizing plaintiffs for immediately run[ning] to the Ninth Circuit, in fact suits against Trumps travel bans have been filed in districts in ten of the 12 regional circuits. And regardless, seeking favorable venues is responsible advocacy. Its why opponents of Obamas policies challenged them in Texas federal courts.The basic reason Trump wants to break up courts in the Ninth circuit is because hes mad at their judges. A 1998 report of a statutory commission appointed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to assess appellate structural alternatives reminds us that It is wrong to realign circuits ... or to restructure courts ...because of particular judicial decisions or particular judges. This rule must be faithfully honored, for the independence of the judiciary is of constitutional dimension and requires no less. (Disclaimer: I worked on the report while at the Federal Judicial Center.)Calls to divide the Ninth circuit and its appellate court have been around since the 1930s. This year, legislators mainly from Ninth circuit states other than California have introduced five restructuring bills. One would reduce the Ninth circuit to California only. Two would add, Hawaii and the Pacific territories to a circuit with California. One would add Oregon to that group, another Oregon and Washington. All would move the rest into a new 12th circuit, with its own court of appeals.The bills sponsors argue that the circuit is too large and the courts caseload too big to allow litigants swift justice and that the court is out of touch with the inter-mountain states. All but one were introduced before Seattle District Judge James Robart issued the first of the rulings that have bedeviled Trump, who has apparently endorsed none of them. Nevertheless, they offer a way to assess whether a break-up would get Trump what he wantsappellate courts with different ideological complexions.Related FixGovTrump owns a shrinking Republican partyElaine Kamarck, Alexander R.

The six Ninth circuit district and circuit judges who have ruled against the administration so far include four Democratic and two Republican appointees. But when the full court of appeals voted 20-5 against having the court review the panels decision, the five dissenters were all Republican appointees (who nevertheless called Trumps criticism of the judges out of all bounds of civic and persuasive discourse). So, party-of-appointing president is a reasonable but hardly iron-clad shorthand surrogate for a more-likely-than-not approval or disapproval of Trumps proposals. (And were looking here only at active-status judges, even though senior and visiting district judges sometimes serve on appellate panels.)Even with these caveats, the bills on the table would do little to serve Trumps decision-oriented goals. The restructured Ninth circuit appellate courts 19 judgeships would still be the largest of the U.S. courts of appeals. The 60% plus majority Democratic appointees will have on the current court once Trump fills four vacancies would be reduced only slightly on a restructured court. Trump might have some opportunity for more appointments, but he likely could not get a Republican-appointee majority at least for a while, given that four of the ten Democratic-appointees on what would be the new Ninth court are aged 51 or younger and older circuit judges tend to stay in active status well past their eligibility to leave it.Related Books What We Owe By Carlo Cottarelli 2017 Inside Congress By Trevor Corning, Reema Dodin, and Kyle Nevins 2017 Calling the Shots By Daniel P. Gitterman 2017And for the foreseeable future, the district judges generating appeals would include many Democratic appointees. Seventy-one life-tenured district judgeships would be in the California- Hawaii-Oregon Ninth circuitten percent of district judgeships nationwide. Of the 63 sitting judges (eight seats are or soon will be vacant), 38 are Democratic appointees, including 31 Obama appointees, who are likely to be around for a while.Although Trump appointees over the next four or eight years would reduce the Democratic-Republican appointee gap on the new courts, they would do that to the current court as well. And any new balance would not guarantee Trump-friendly decisions, in part because Democratic senators Feinstein and Harris will probably have a say in future nominations, and, anyway, few judges adhere to a strict party line.Finally, a 19 judgeship appellate court with 16 of them based in California risks insularity, lacking the benefit of perspectives of judges from other parts of the west. AuthorRussell WheelerVisiting Fellow - Governance StudiesRather than bow to hasty analysisor worse yet, to Trumps anger at judgesif Congress is genuinely concerned about the operation of the Ninth circuits court of appeals, it should consider Republican Senators Daines (MT) and Sullivans (AK) bill, a near-verbatim version of the statute that created the 1998 Rehnquist-appointed commission (which recommended restructuring the court but not the circuit). And, if Congress creates the new commission and it does its job objectively, as did the earlier commission, Congress should pay attention to its conclusions.	2017/05/16	factcheck

Turn it over and read the legend under the pyramid–“novus ordo seclorum”–“a New Order of the Ages.” Hollywood makes it the center of a treasure hunt. Religious nuts who populate the world of cable TV shows like the 700 Club, rail on about Masonic Lodges. But these words had a meaning that would be immediate to all of the Founding Fathers with an education in the classics (which was nearly all of them). Unlike most Americans today, they would have read Virgil’s Aeneid, in which these words play a powerful role (bk vii, 44), and they would know Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue, which is reproduced as today’s poem. In the Middle Ages an effort was made to reconcile Virgil to Christianity. He was made the John the Baptist of Latin literature, the man who foretold the arrival of the Christ—the child of the Fourth Eclogue, whose coming would bring a New Order of the Ages to the world. That was a fanciful interpretation, since literary researchers have since developed the facts of this poem in some detail. It was crafted for Virgil’s patron, the consul Pollio, then in the first year of his office, and at the same time a son had been born to him. It is that rather tedious domestic detail that provides the basis for the work–at one level. But at another, clearly the “father” to whom he refers would be Octavian, to be known as Caesar Augustus, and the “son” the offspring the Empire anticipated in 44 BCE, as this was being written. In any event, these lines are glorious and noble, and they express the aspiration that Virgil had for the times. The battle of Brundisium was over; Octavian was triumphant. The hope was for an end to the strife that marked the death of the Republic and the rise of Empire, and instead for peace, for the pax romana. Virgil’s lesser works and the Aeneid are arguably the greatest poetical works in the Latin language, but they can and should also be seen as political works. Virgil seeks to create a Foundation myth for Rome–and in the process, he struggles to reconcile the values of the Republic and the Empire. As Hermann Broch showed in his novel Der Tod des Vergil, one of the greatest literary works of the last century (in any event, certainly the best crafted by a professor at Yale), this has immediate relevance to political and social developments in the twentieth century. It parallels in a striking way the debate over liberal democracy and fascism within the Europe of the 1920s and 1930s, a debate that echoes today. In fact, I came back to Virgil recently, led there by Leo Strauss. I have been trying to understand Strauss and his rather problematic relationship with the Neocons, and in the process was reading through Strauss’s works from the period immediately after he left Germany in the early thirties. I found his writings and his correspondence replete with Virgil citations, many of which struck me as odd—this was not the Virgil I learned in school. It was a Virgil crafted in the shape of Wilhelmine Germany: Strauss had conjured up a curiously bellicose Virgil. In the critical Fourth Eclogue, with its notion of a new-born age, Virgil is marking the transition from the Hellenic/Homeric era to a new Roman one. And in the Aeneid he develops this much further, writing a response to the poet Lucretius, and specifically to Lucretius’s appeal for world peace. The first three words herald this: “arma virumque cano“–“I sing about arms and man.” The Homeric epic focuses on heroes and kings; the role of law in this order is limited, largely set in terms of divine wrath, and often conflicted. There is the law of hospitality writ large; there are some customs of war, but they are minimal and irregularly observed. But when Virgil writes “arms,” he means not just feats, but customs and rules; he is writing in the wake of Lucretius, who decried the violence and suffering of the Homeric world. Lucretius wanted a new world in which humans achieve a more dignified life through art and philosophy. He sees peace as essential to this vision. Virgil tells us that Lucretius’s aspiration is fair, but his formula will never achieve it. At the core of Virgil’s reply, the essential foundation for a peace, is the concept of novus ordo seclorum, a New Order for the Ages–and this order rests on law, justice and piety. The legal component of the Aeneid is striking and not much commented upon. No other poet of the Augustan age is so obsessed with law. But not just law. A large part of Virgil’s new order consists of the laws of war. This is a hallmark of the new order. A nation is civilized if it follows the laws of war; otherwise it has descended into barbarity. The new order of the Augustan age included a law of nations and a law of war. These were seen as essential tools to the creation of an Empire and to the assimilation of the newly incorporated peoples. They were seen as the foundation for the pax romana. When the American Founding Fathers turn to this classical phrase, they are making a proud claim–that the introduction of democracy in America would mark a new age for mankind–just as the Augustan age saw its law-based state as the natural next step in the evolution of humanity from the Homeric world. The Americans stake this claim on the new social and political order they have created, one in which heroes and kings pass into the mist, and the citizen rises as sovereign. And again, a new concept of the laws of war lies at the center of this idea. Their novus ordo seclorum is not only about democracy; it is also about the concept of humanitarian warfare. Indeed, the new order could never be without this. Virgil’s claim is crafted in literature and sustained by history. The Roman dream faded and their Empire fell, as is the invariable fate of all empires. The claim of the Founding Fathers likewise has withstood the test of time and the American Republic today faces the test of Empires. How will it weather this test. How can anyone say? On the back of the Great Seal of the United States, above the phrase novus ordo seclorum appears an all-seeing eye, and the phrase annuit coeptis, adapted from another work of Virgil’s (Georgics, bk i, l 40: Da facilem cursum, atque audacibus annue cœptis, “Let me take the easy way and favor my audacious efforts”). Thus it is a plea for divine favor, but also a reminder of our accountability before God and our fellow man. The words of the Great Seal reflect a deep vision of the Founding Fathers, an understanding wrestled from Virgil, a faith in a new order that the American Republic would bring the world. But with it rested a conviction that each generation would face a test, simple and profound: of fidelity to foundational values. When I think how we must score in this test today, I fear for my nation and my fellow citizens.

By Jonathan Taplin Donald Trump’s presidency signals a profound but inchoate realignment of American politics. On the one hand, his administration may represent the consolidation of minority control by a Republican-dominated Senate under the leadership of a president who came to office after losing the popular vote by almost 3 million ballots. Such an imbalance of power could lead to a second civil war—indeed, the nation’s first and only great fraternal conflagration was sparked off in part for precisely this reason. On the other hand, Trump’s reign may be merely an interregnum, in which the old white power structure of the Republican Party is dying and a new oppositional coalition struggles to be born.Illustration by Taylor Callery (detail) Article Blood Money· = Subscribers only.Sign in here.Subscribe here. By Andrew Cockburn Over the past three years, the city of South Tucson, Arizona, a largely Latino enclave nestled inside metropolitan Tucson, came close to abolishing its fire and police departments. It did sell off the library and cut back fire-truck crews from four to three people—whereupon two thirds of the fire department quit—and slashed the police force to just sixteen employees. “We’re a small city, just one square mile, surrounded by a larger city,” the finance director, Lourdes Aguirre, explained to me. “We have small-town dollars and big-city problems.”Illustration by John Ritter (detail) Article The Tragedy of Ted Cruz· = Subscribers only.Sign in here.Subscribe here. By Ana Marie Cox When I saw Ted Cruz speak, in early August, it was at Underwood’s Cafeteria in Brownwood. He was on a weeklong swing through rural central Texas, hitting small towns and military bases that ensured him friendly, if not always entirely enthusiastic, crowds. In Brownwood, some in the audience of two hundred were still nibbling on peach cobbler as Cruz began with an anecdote about his win in a charity basketball game against ABC’s late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. They rewarded him with smug chuckles when he pointed out that “Hollywood celebrities” would be hurting over the defeat “for the next fifty years.” His pitch for votes was still an off-the-rack Tea Party platform, complete with warnings about the menace of creeping progressivism, delivered at a slightly mechanical pace but with lots of punch. The woman next to me remarked, “This is the fire in the gut! Like he had the first time!” referring to Cruz’s successful long-shot run in the 2011 Texas Republican Senate primary. And it’s true—the speech was exactly like one Cruz would have delivered in 2011, right down to one specific detail: he never mentioned Donald Trump by name. Cruz recited almost verbatim the same things Trump lists as the administration’s accomplishments: the new tax legislation, reduced African-American unemployment, repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, and Neil Gorsuch’s appointment to the Supreme Court.

HARPER’S FINEST Article — From the August 2010 issue Happiness Is a Worn Gun By Dan Baum Illustration by Stan Fellows “Nowadays, most states let just about anybody who wants a concealed-handgun permit have one; in seventeen states, you don’t even have to be a resident. Nobody knows exactly how many Americans carry guns, because not all states release their numbers, and even if they did, not all permit holders carry all the time. It’s there on every dollar bill. Turn it over and read the legend under the pyramid–“novus ordo seclorum”–“a New Order of the Ages.” Hollywood makes it the center of a treasure hunt. Religious nuts who populate the world of cable TV shows like the 700 Club, rail on about Masonic Lodges. But these words had a meaning that would be immediate to all of the Founding Fathers with an education in the classics (which was nearly all of them). Unlike most Americans today, they would have read Virgil’s Aeneid, in which these words play a powerful role (bk vii, 44), and they would know Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue, which is reproduced as today’s poem. In the Middle Ages an effort was made to reconcile Virgil to Christianity. He was made the John the Baptist of Latin literature, the man who foretold the arrival of the Christ—the child of the Fourth Eclogue, whose coming would bring a New Order of the Ages to the world. That was a fanciful interpretation, since literary researchers have since developed the facts of this poem in some detail. It was crafted for Virgil’s patron, the consul Pollio, then in the first year of his office, and at the same time a son had been born to him. It is that rather tedious domestic detail that provides the basis for the work–at one level. But at another, clearly the “father” to whom he refers would be Octavian, to be known as Caesar Augustus, and the “son” the offspring the Empire anticipated in 44 BCE, as this was being written. In any event, these lines are glorious and noble, and they express the aspiration that Virgil had for the times. The battle of Brundisium was over; Octavian was triumphant. The hope was for an end to the strife that marked the death of the Republic and the rise of Empire, and instead for peace, for the pax romana. Virgil’s lesser works and the Aeneid are arguably the greatest poetical works in the Latin language, but they can and should also be seen as political works. Virgil seeks to create a Foundation myth for Rome–and in the process, he struggles to reconcile the values of the Republic and the Empire. As Hermann Broch showed in his novel Der Tod des Vergil, one of the greatest literary works of the last century (in any event, certainly the best crafted by a professor at Yale), this has immediate relevance to political and social developments in the twentieth century. It parallels in a striking way the debate over liberal democracy and fascism within the Europe of the 1920s and 1930s, a debate that echoes today. In fact, I came back to Virgil recently, led there by Leo Strauss. I have been trying to understand Strauss and his rather problematic relationship with the Neocons, and in the process was reading through Strauss’s works from the period immediately after he left Germany in the early thirties. I found his writings and his correspondence replete with Virgil citations, many of which struck me as odd—this was not the Virgil I learned in school. It was a Virgil crafted in the shape of Wilhelmine Germany: Strauss had conjured up a curiously bellicose Virgil. In the critical Fourth Eclogue, with its notion of a new-born age, Virgil is marking the transition from the Hellenic/Homeric era to a new Roman one. And in the Aeneid he develops this much further, writing a response to the poet Lucretius, and specifically to Lucretius’s appeal for world peace. The first three words herald this: “arma virumque cano“–“I sing about arms and man.” The Homeric epic focuses on heroes and kings; the role of law in this order is limited, largely set in terms of divine wrath, and often conflicted. There is the law of hospitality writ large; there are some customs of war, but they are minimal and irregularly observed. But when Virgil writes “arms,” he means not just feats, but customs and rules; he is writing in the wake of Lucretius, who decried the violence and suffering of the Homeric world. Lucretius wanted a new world in which humans achieve a more dignified life through art and philosophy. He sees peace as essential to this vision. Virgil tells us that Lucretius’s aspiration is fair, but his formula will never achieve it. At the core of Virgil’s reply, the essential foundation for a peace, is the concept of novus ordo seclorum, a New Order for the Ages–and this order rests on law, justice and piety. The legal component of the Aeneid is striking and not much commented upon. No other poet of the Augustan age is so obsessed with law. But not just law. A large part of Virgil’s new order consists of the laws of war. This is a hallmark of the new order. A nation is civilized if it follows the laws of war; otherwise it has descended into barbarity. The new order of the Augustan age included a law of nations and a law of war. These were seen as essential tools to the creation of an Empire and to the assimilation of the newly incorporated peoples. They were seen as the foundation for the pax romana. When the American Founding Fathers turn to this classical phrase, they are making a proud claim–that the introduction of democracy in America would mark a new age for mankind–just as the Augustan age saw its law-based state as the natural next step in the evolution of humanity from the Homeric world. The Americans stake this claim on the new social and political order they have created, one in which heroes and kings pass into the mist, and the citizen rises as sovereign. And again, a new concept of the laws of war lies at the center of this idea. Their novus ordo seclorum is not only about democracy; it is also about the concept of humanitarian warfare. Indeed, the new order could never be without this. Virgil’s claim is crafted in literature and sustained by history. The Roman dream faded and their Empire fell, as is the invariable fate of all empires. The claim of the Founding Fathers likewise has withstood the test of time and the American Republic today faces the test of Empires. How will it weather this test. How can anyone say? On the back of the Great Seal of the United States, above the phrase novus ordo seclorum appears an all-seeing eye, and the phrase annuit coeptis, adapted from another work of Virgil’s (Georgics, bk i, l 40: Da facilem cursum, atque audacibus annue cœptis, “Let me take the easy way and favor my audacious efforts”). Thus it is a plea for divine favor, but also a reminder of our accountability before God and our fellow man. The words of the Great Seal reflect a deep vision of the Founding Fathers, an understanding wrestled from Virgil, a faith in a new order that the American Republic would bring the world. But with it rested a conviction that each generation would face a test, simple and profound: of fidelity to foundational values. When I think how we must score in this test today, I fear for my nation and my fellow citizens. Joseph Hickman discusses his new book, The Burn Pits, which tells the story of thousands of U.S. soldiers who, after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, have developed rare cancers and respiratory diseases. Donald Trump’s presidency signals a profound but inchoate realignment of American politics. On the one hand, his administration may represent the consolidation of minority control by a Republican-dominated Senate under the leadership of a president who came to office after losing the popular vote by almost 3 million ballots. Such an imbalance of power could lead to a second civil war—indeed, the nation’s first and only great fraternal conflagration was sparked off in part for precisely this reason. On the other hand, Trump’s reign may be merely an interregnum, in which the old white power structure of the Republican Party is dying and a new oppositional coalition struggles to be born. Over the past three years, the city of South Tucson, Arizona, a largely Latino enclave nestled inside metropolitan Tucson, came close to abolishing its fire and police departments. It did sell off the library and cut back fire-truck crews from four to three people—whereupon two thirds of the fire department quit—and slashed the police force to just sixteen employees. “We’re a small city, just one square mile, surrounded by a larger city,” the finance director, Lourdes Aguirre, explained to me. When I saw Ted Cruz speak, in early August, it was at Underwood’s Cafeteria in Brownwood. He was on a weeklong swing through rural central Texas, hitting small towns and military bases that ensured him friendly, if not always entirely enthusiastic, crowds. In Brownwood, some in the audience of two hundred were still nibbling on peach cobbler as Cruz began with an anecdote about his win in a charity basketball game against ABC’s late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. They rewarded him with smug chuckles when he pointed out that “Hollywood celebrities” would be hurting over the defeat “for the next fifty years.” His pitch for votes was still an off-the-rack Tea Party platform, complete with warnings about the menace of creeping progressivism, delivered at a slightly mechanical pace but with lots of punch. The woman next to me remarked, “This is the fire in the gut! Like he had the first time!” referring to Cruz’s successful long-shot run in the 2011 Texas Republican Senate primary. And it’s true—the speech was exactly like one Cruz would have delivered in 2011, right down to one specific detail: he never mentioned Donald Trump by name. Cruz recited almost verbatim the same things Trump lists as the administration’s accomplishments: the new tax legislation, reduced African-American unemployment, repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, and Neil Gorsuch’s appointment to the Supreme Court. But, in a mirror image of those in the #Resistance who refuse to ennoble Trump with the title “president,” Cruz only called him that. e is a nondescript man.

The renovations will restore two of the country's most important cultural sites - the Greek Orthodox Monastery of Apostolos Andreas and Hala Sultan Tekke, a Moslem mosque.As part of USAID's $60 million grant to the United Nations Development Program, the $5 million restorations were hailed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as a ""very constructive step forward."" The projects promote mutual understanding and tolerance between the geographically separated Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities and have taken place as unprecedented negotiations for a political settlement are ongoing between the two groups.USAID Assistant Administrator Dr. Kent Hill echoed the sentiments of the U.N. Secretary General and noted that ""this restoration, bringing together the two ethnic communities, is a sign of mutual respect for the island's multi-ethnic past and a symbol of peaceful coexistence."" Symbolic of the project's cultural tolerance, Greek Orthodox Cypriots are restoring the Moslem mosque while Muslim Turkish Cypriots are working on the monastery.The Monastery of Apostolos Andreas is located near the spot where St. Andrew is said to have come ashore for water while on a voyage from the Holy Land to Greece in the first century A.D. Hala Sultan Tekke, one of the holiest sites in Islam, is the most important religious location for Cypriot Muslims. It is revered as the burial site of Umm Haram, a close follower of the Prophet, and is one of the earliest Islamic sites dedicated to a woman.U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. Bandler visited both sites to review the work accomplished to date. In a time when cultural icons are often the target of destructive forces, Ambassador Bandler called this ""an inspiring example of two sides with unresolved differences cooperating to preserve their shared cultural heritage.""The USAID-funded restorations are implemented through the U.N. Bicommunal Development Program. They are one of many multi-sectoral, practical initiatives through which Greek and Turkish Cypriots carry out projects in areas of common concern. These projects address a wide range of issues that transcend the boundaries separating the two communities, including protection of the environment; maintenance of shared infrastructure; strengthening of civil society organizations, especially those focused on gender and youth; and tackling of public health concerns.USAID is the government agency providing U.S. economic and humanitarian assistance worldwide for more than 40 years."		factcheck

The International Astronomical Union (IAU), the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos, has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet. That’s right, the little dwarf will be rejoining the ranks of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Planet-X (the planet that will surely spell doom for all humanity).As many of you know, in 2006, the IAU made their infamousvote, deciding to demote everyone’s favorite planet to a “dwarf planet.” Their reasoning was that too many people would confuse Pluto (the doggy of Disney fame) with Pluto (the planet, of space and stuff). Immediately after this 2006 announcement, the public exploded with outrage. There were a number of campaigns launched that were aimed at ensuring that Pluto was reinstated as a planet. These met with no success. Pluto was officially classified as a dwarf planet.But all of that just changed, After years of deliberation, the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy world—they upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. “We simply underestimated the public’s attachment to Pluto.We realized our error shortly after the decision came down to demote it,” said Dr. Amy Joggy, professor at the Institute of Planetary Studies and head of the IAU’s Planetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force. “We didn’t think anyone would really care if a little clump of ice and rock on the outskirts of the solar system was reclassified. Clearly, we dun messed up, and that makes me super sad face.Today, we take steps to correct this most grievous of errors.In addition to Pluto’s reclassification, Dr. Joggy has also proposed that the IAU create a new category of planet called a “hyper-planet.” These hyper-planets, according to Dr. Joggy, are like regular planets but at least two times as awesome (thanks to the fancy, fancy name).It has also been proposed that Pluto be made an honorary member of this new planetary class. “In all honesty, we feel bad for the way we treated Pluto and, more importantly, all those that cared about it so greatly- the public showed us our error. Hopefully, the new class of planet will be created without a hitch, and Pluto will be added as the first member. It’s only fair.”Say it with me now, “Yay!”		factcheck

Israeli news outlet Maariv reported that during the meeting, Kerry told Agha to share a message with Abbas –urging him to “hold on and be strong” during talks with the Trump administration and “play for time…[and] not yield to President Trump’s demands.”Kerry, who served as former President Barack Obama’s secretary of state during his second term, also reportedly referred to Trump using derogatory language, and said he would not be in office for long, suggesting he could be out in a year. Kerry also allegedly asked Abbas not to attack the U.S. or the Trump administration, but rather focus attacks on the president himself.“The original story wasn't accurate, and I’ve read that Mr. Agha himself has made that clear. These are neither Secretary Kerry's views nor anything he would say,” a spokesman for Kerry told Fox News Friday.JOHN KERRY REPORTEDLY COACHES PALESTINIANS NOT TO 'YIELD' TO TRUMP IN PEACE TALKS, SPURRING BACKLASH Kerry also reportedly told Agha that he was considering running for president in 2020.“He’s said before, publicly, that he’s not thinking of it,” Kerry’s spokesman told Fox News in an email. “Nothing’s changed.”The White House did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Kerry’s alleged remarks.A spokesman for John Kerry denies that he gave advice to Palestinian Authority President Mahmood Abbas. (AP)The State Department told Fox News it would decline to comment on the report.Kerry’s meeting with the Palestinian Authority representatives comes just one month after the Trump administration decided, after years of U.S. promises, to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.According to Israeli media, Arab leaders in Davos this week expressed hope they could resume peace talks, despite the Jerusalem controversy.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Sources who've seen the warrants told Pegues it appeared to them that the real target of the raids was Mr. Trump. One source called it a ""search and destroy mission.""The search warrants also listed records related to the release of the so-called ""Access Hollywood"" tape, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News' Andres Triay and Len Tepper. The New York Times first reported the connection to the tape. The warrants executed at Cohen's office, hotel room and home became public knowledge Monday. Trump attorney says he's ""not worried"" by FBI raids The FBI raid of Cohen's home, office and hotel room stemmed from information gathered during the course of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling but is part of a separate federal investigation. The searches were spearheaded by the FBI's public corruption unit.Investigators were also looking for information related to non-disclosure agreements between Cohen and adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is cooperating with federal investigators. Cohen has admitted to paying Daniels $130,000 ahead of the election, although the White House has continued to deny any sexual encounter between Mr. Trump and the adult film starThe raids were personally approved by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

James has been doing a fabulous job. He understands these issues, knows exactly what our challenges are, and is working steadfastly every day to meet them.Thank you also to Katherine Reilly, Kate Sheehy, Chris Santoro, Edward So, David Neal, Chief Judge Keller, Lisa Ward, Jean King, Robin Sutman, and all of the leadership team.It is good to be with you today.Each one of you plays an important role in the administration of our immigration laws. Immigration judges are critical to ensuring that the Department of Justice carries out its responsibilities under the INA. You have an obligation to decide cases efficiently and to keep our federal laws functioning effectively, fairly, and consistently. As the statute states, Immigration Judges conduct designated proceedings “subject to such supervision and shall perform such duties as the Attorney General shall prescribe”. This responsibility seeks to ensure that our immigration system operates in a manner that is consistent with the laws enacted by Congress. As you know, the INA was established to ensure a rational system of immigration in the national interest.Of course there are provisions in the INA, consent decrees, regulations, and court decisions where the commonsense enforceability of the plain intent of the INA has been made more difficult. That's what you wrestle with frequently. President Trump is correct: Congress needs to clarify a number of these matters. Without Congressional action, clarity and consistency for us is much more difficult.Let’s be clear: we have a firm goal, and that is to end the lawlessness that now exists in our immigration system. This Department of Justice is committed to using every available resource to meet that goal. We will act strategically with our colleagues at DHS and across the government, and we will not hesitate to redeploy resources and alter policies to meet new challenges as they arise.Last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it will begin to refer as close to 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossers as possible to the Department of Justice for prosecution. The Department of Justice will take up those cases.I have put in place a “zero tolerance” policy for illegal entry on our Southwest border. If you cross the Southwest border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple.If someone is smuggling illegal aliens across our Southwest border, then we will prosecute them. Period.I have sent 35 prosecutors to the Southwest and moved 18 immigration judges to detention centers near the border. That is about a 50 percent increase in the number of immigration judges who will be handling cases at the border.”All of us should agree that, by definition, we ought to have zero illegal immigration in this country. Each of us is a part of the Executive Branch, and it is our duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”Ours is a public trust.And the United States of America is not a vague idea. It is not just a landmass or an economy. Ours is a sovereign nation state with a constitution, laws, elections, and borders. As you all well know, one of our major difficulties today is the asylum process.The asylum system is being abused to the detriment of the rule of law, sound public policy, and public safety— and to the detriment of people with just claims. Saying a few simple words—claiming a fear of return—is now transforming a straightforward arrest for illegal entry and immediate return into a prolonged legal process, where an alien may be released from custody into the United States and possibly never show up for an immigration hearing. This is a large part of what has been accurately called, “catch and release”.Beginning in 2009, more and more aliens who passed an initial USCIS credible fear review were released from custody into the United States pending a full hearing. Powerful incentives were created for aliens to come here illegally and claim a fear of return. In effect, word spread that by asserting this fear, they could remain in the United States one way or the other. Far too often, that rumor proved to be true. The results are just what one would expect. The number of illegal entrants has surged. Credible fear claims have skyrocketed, and the percentage of asylum claims found meritorious by our judges declined.That’s because the vast majority of the current asylum claims are not valid. For the last five years, only 20 percent of claims have been found to be meritorious after a hearing before an Immigration Judge. In addition, some fifteen percent are found invalid by USCIS as a part of their initial screening.Further illustrating this point, in 2009, DHS conducted more than 5,000 credible fear reviews. By 2016, only seven years later, that number had increased to 94,000. The number of these aliens placed in immigration court proceedings went from fewer than 4,000 to more than 73,000 by 2016—nearly a 19-fold increase—overwhelming the system and leaving legitimate claims buried.Now we all know that many of those crossing our border illegally are leaving difficult and dangerous situations. And we understand all are due proper respect and the proper legal process. But we cannot abandon legal discipline and sound legal concepts.Under the INA, asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems— even all serious problems— that people face every day all over the world.Today, exercising the responsibility given to me under the INA, I will be issuing a decision that restores sound principles of asylum and long standing principles of immigration law.We have not acted hastily, but carefully. In my judgment, this is a correct interpretation of the law. It advances the original intent and purpose of the INA, and it will be your duty to carry out this ruling.This decision will provide more clarity for you. It will help you to rule consistently and fairly.The fact is we have a backlog of about 700,000 immigration cases, and it’s still growing. That’s more than triple what it was in 2009. This is not acceptable. We cannot allow it to continue.At this time, when our immigration system and our immigration judges are under great stress, I am calling on you to use your best efforts and proper policies to enhance our effectiveness. To end the lawlessness and move to the virtuous cycle, we have to be very productive. Volume is critical. It just is. We ask you to evaluate your processes and disposition rates.We ask each one of you to complete at least 700 cases a year. It’s about the average. We are all accountable. Setting this expectation is a rational management policy to ensure consistency, accountability, and efficiency in our immigration court system. Thank you for working every day to meet and exceed this goal. You can be sure that this administration and this Department of Justice supports you in this critically important and historic effort.That’s why we are hiring more than 100 new immigration judges this calendar year. And we are actively working with our partners at DHS to ensure that we can deploy judges electronically and by video-teleconference where needed and to obtain appropriate courtroom facilities.Let’s be clear. These actions will not end or reduce legal immigration. These actions will be directed at reducing illegal immigration. Only Congress can change legal immigration.This is a great nation—the greatest in the history of the world. It is no surprise that people want to come here. But they must do so according to law. When we lose clarity or have decisions that hold out hope where a fair reading of the law gives none, we have cruelly hurt many people. As we resolutely strive to consistently and fairly enforce the law, we will be doing the right thing.The world will know what our rules are, and great numbers will no longer undertake this dangerous journey. The number of illegal aliens and the number of baseless claims will fall. A virtuous cycle will be created, rather than a vicious cycle of expanding illegality.The American people have spoken. They have spoken in our laws and they have spoken in our elections. They want a safe, secure border and a lawful system of immigration that actually works.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles now will be required by law to forward the records of all licensed drivers to California Secretary of State Alex Padilla’s office to be automatically registered to vote unless a driver purposefully opts out at the DMV.After non-citizens were given driving privileges in 2015, concerns over their impact on voter fraud were raised, leading Padilla to insist voter fraud was “ nearly nonexistent .”Coming under scrutiny, Padilla has said illegals won’t be able to vote in California, as his office is being trusted to cross-check citizenship before issuing the vote. But the new law raises eyebrows about the potential for illegal aliens to be granted the vote either by bureaucratic mishandling or intentional malfeasance. California is home to an estimated 2.3 million illegal immigrants and Padilla’s boss, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, has officially declared California a “ sanctuary state .” Last week, California also announced it would prosecute any private employer who aided federal immigration officials attempting to remove illegals. Amidst allegations of voter fraud in California during the 2016 election, Padilla refused to cooperate with a commission investigating illegitimate votes. In 2017 Secretary Padilla responded to the inquiry by saying, “The President’s Commission is a waste of taxpayer money and a distraction from the real threats to the integrity of our elections today: aging voting systems and documented Russian interference in our elections.”According to the Washington Times, at least one study suggests the 2008 general election may have had as many as 5.7 million non-citizens voting. In 2016, Virginia removed 5,556 votes in just 138 cities and counties for being non-citizens. Pew data from 2016 suggests 2.75 million people have voter registrations in more than one state, and 1.8 million voter were deceased.While President Trump was assembling his advisory team, Padilla called his appointments “a threat to diverse communities throughout our nation” and “an imminent assault on our collective voting rights and civil rights” for their critical stance against illegal immigration.Padilla’s own parents immigrated from Mexico to California.Pawl Bazile is a journalist and the Production Director for Proud Boy Magazine .

For permission to reprint or reproduce multiple copies, please see our copyright policy .Principal author(s)Dawn Davies; Canadian Paediatric Society, Bioethics CommitteePaediatr Child Health 2018, 23(2):125–130AbstractThe Supreme Court decision in Carter v. Canada (2015) has led to changes to the Canadian Criminal Code, such that physician-assisted death is now a legal option for consenting adult patients who have a ‘grievous and irremediable medical condition’ that causes ‘enduring’ and ‘intolerable’ suffering. In June 2016, Bill C-14 was enacted, allowing medical assistance in dying (MAID) for an eligible adult whose death is ‘reasonably foreseeable’. An independent report on the status of ‘mature minors’ (who are currently excluded under federal legislation), with focus on their potential eligibility for MAID, was required by the 2016 Act and is expected to be presented to Parliament by December 2018. Ensuring that newborns, children and youth receive the highest possible standard of care as they are dying is a privilege and a responsibility for physicians and allied professionals. Bringing a thoughtful, respectful and personal approach to every end-of-life situation is an essential and evolving duty of care, and the process should meet each patient’s (and family’s) unique social, cultural and spiritual needs. This statement describes the current Canadian legal and medical context of MAID and articulates a paediatric perspective that has emerged from—and been informed by—the broad, structured consultation process unfolding in Canada and elsewhere. Although ‘mature minors’ are the only youth currently mandated for further legislative consideration in Canada, the need to examine requests for and attitudes around MAID for minors of all ages remains compelling for two main reasons:Canadian health care professionals are increasingly being approached by the parents of ‘never-competent’ infants and children, including those too young to make a reasoned decision, and by youth themselves, to discuss MAID-related issues. Results from a Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) survey, discussed below, indicate that parents raise such questions with paediatricians more often than do minors.The discussion of MAID policy in Canada has been framed as much by the issue and context of suffering as by considerations of autonomy. While current legislation clearly prohibits MAID for incapable persons at the request of any other person, it is possible that parents may request MAID on behalf of their dying child.Keywords: Euthanasia; MAID; Mature minors; Medical assistance in dyingDEFINITIONSNow that ‘physician-assisted death’ has been expanded in Canada to include participation by nurse practitioners, the term Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) is used. MAID can take two forms:Euthanasia: At the patient’s voluntary request, a practitioner administers medication that causes the patient’s death.Practitioner-assisted suicide (PAS): At the patient’s voluntary request, a practitioner prescribes or provides medication that a patient can self-administer to cause their own death.For the purposes of this statement, specific references to Carter v. Canada may also include the language used in that particular case (e.g., physician-assisted death or dying).A mature minor is the category of minor identified by the government for further independent review under the Federal Act of June 2016, which amended the Canadian Criminal Code [1] to comply with Carter v. Canada [2].The mature minor doctrine recognizes that a patient’s comprehension of the nature and consequences of a treatment has determinants beyond age, and that children’s wishes should be granted degrees of deference that reflect their evolving maturity. The doctrine provides an opportunity for physicians to determine a child’s capacity for consent, using similar considerations as for an adult [3]. The mature minor doctrine is acknowledged under common law but is not recognized as such in the province of Quebec, which operates under the Civil Code of Quebec. Minors aged 14 years or older may independently consent to some forms of medical care or treatment in Quebec. Parental (or substitute decision-maker) notification is required if the child is in hospital or another health care setting for more than 12 hours. A parent’s (or substitute decision-maker’s) consent may also be required if the proposed treatment is either not required by the state of the child’s health or if it entails a serious risk to health and could cause serious and permanent effects [4].Substantive criteria are terms of eligibility that ‘qualify’ a person as a candidate to receive MAID [5]. Under the Federal Act, these include:Being 18 years of age and capable of making health decisions;Having a grievous and irremediable medical condition (more specifically, having a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability; being in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability; experiencing enduring, intolerable physical or psychological suffering; with natural death being reasonably foreseeable);Making a voluntary request for MAID; andBeing capable of giving informed consent (after having been informed of means available to relieve suffering, including palliative care).Procedural due care criteria refer to the safeguards in place to ensure that the substantive criteria outlined above are, in fact, satisfied [5]. Under the Federal Act, before providing MAID, the practitioner must:Hold the opinion that a person meets all substantive criteria;Ensure that a request for MAID is made in writing and that the document is witnessed, signed and dated after a person has been diagnosed with and informed by a practitioner as having a grievous and irremediable medical condition;Ensure the person knows that a request for MAID can be withdrawn at any point;Ensure that a second independent practitioner confirms in writing that all substantive criteria have been met;Ensure a waiting period of at least 10 clear days between the date of a signed request and the date on which MAID is to be provided. A shorter waiting period is possible when both the practitioner and the independent practitioner share the opinion that the person’s death or loss of capacity to provide informed consent is imminent;Offer the person the opportunity to withdraw their request and elicit their express consent to proceed immediately before MAID is provided.BACKGROUNDDebate around physician-assisted death in Canada came to the forefront of public policy in 2015, with the Carter v. Canada case [2] and Quebec’s Act respecting end-of-life care (or Bill 52, hereafter referred to as the Quebec Act). The latter was enacted and came into effect in Quebec in December 2015, even though Canada’s Criminal Code was not yet amended to comply with the ruling in Carter v. Canada [6]. See the Parliamentary report on the Federal Act for a full chronology and review of events [7]. Under the Quebec Act, euthanasia (or ‘medical aid in dying’) is a potential option for a capable, consenting patient ‘of full age’ who makes a ‘free and informed’ request and is suffering from ‘serious and incurable’ illness. Similar to the federal legislation, which allows access to assistance only for individuals ‘at least 18 years of age’ who are in an ‘advanced state of irreversible decline in capability’ and requires that death be ‘reasonably foreseeable’ [1], Quebec’s legislation restricts MAID to patients of full age in an ‘advanced state of irreversible decline in capability’ and at ‘end of life’. The Supreme Court did not expressly limit physician-assisted death to life-threatening or terminal physical illness in Carter v. Canada, which implies that a broader group of persons might eventually be eligible for medically-assisted death (e.g., those with a significant disability or intractable mental illness) [8].MAID AND PAEDIATRICS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONSAt present, The Netherlands and Belgium are the only two jurisdictions where legislation extends the practice of MAID to infants and/or children. In 1997, The Netherlands government ministry of security and justice convened a multidisciplinary commission to evaluate reporting on the frequency and reasons for ‘deliberately ending the life of a newborn’ (DELN) [9]. In 2005, the Dutch Paediatric Society (NVK) published the Groningen Protocol, a decisional process leading to DELN with parental consent [10]. This process is specific to infants who are judged by neonatologists to be experiencing ‘hopeless and unbearable suffering’. Infants defined as suffering include those who:Are deemed to have no chance of survival (i.e., they will die soon after birth, despite optimal care);Have minimal chance of surviving beyond the intensive treatment period, with a poor prognosis and poor quality of life; orMay not be dependent on intensive treatment, but whose prognosis is ‘hopeless’, along with a very poor anticipated quality of life.It is beyond the scope of this statement to describe the Groningen Protocol in detail, but the process has been controversial [11][12].With respect to minors other than newborns, a Dutch law of 2002 [13] allowed physicians to provide MAID to minors 16 to 18 years of age. Eligible minors must have a reasonable understanding of their interests and their parents or guardians must have been ‘involved in the decision-making process’, although they do not necessarily have to agree with their child’s decision for MAID to be permitted. Minors 12 to 16 years of age may also receive MAID upon request, provided they are ‘deemed to have a reasonable understanding’ of their interests and their parent(s) or guardian(s) agree with the child’s request. Surveys have shown that most Dutch paediatricians believe that physician-assisted dying can be an acceptable option for children younger than 12 years of age, although the practice is prohibited [14].A 2002 Belgian law [15] allowed MAID for adults and ‘emancipated minors’ who were conscious and competent when making their requests [16]. In practice to date, an emancipated minor is at least 16 years old and a judge’s involvement and determination is required [17]. A 2014 amendment extended permissibility for euthanasia—with the agreement from a legal guardian—to nonemancipated children without age restriction [18]. However, the child must possess ‘capacity for discernment’ as evaluated by a child psychiatrist or a psychologist, which will likely operate to exclude the youngest patients. Before euthanasia can be legal, the child’s illness must be incurable and terminal, and the physical pain untreatable [19].Other jurisdictions that allow MAID for adults, including Luxembourg and Columbia, prohibit this option for all minors, including mature minors. Switzerland and all American states that allow PAS similarly restrict this option to adults.POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY ISSUES FOR MATURE MINORS IN CANADAA panel of provincial/territorial experts on MAID, tasked with exploring options for a legislative response to the Carter decision, released its final report on November 30, 2015. Recommendation 17 stated that access to PAS should not be ‘impeded by the imposition of arbitrary age limits’ and that relevant changes to the Criminal Code should be based on ‘competence rather than age’ [20]. This wording raised the issue of access to MAID for youth who met ‘mature minor’ doctrine requirements.Although issues of suffering and autonomy apply to children and youth as well as adults, the first iteration of Canadian MAID legislation restricted access to services to adults ≥18 years of age. This decision was not arbitrary. A leading criteria (or qualifying condition) in the Supreme Court ruling was that the person seeking physician-assisted death must be an adult. Furthermore, the Supreme Court acknowledged (in para. 24) the trial judge’s finding in Carter v. Canada that:… while there is no clear societal consensus on physician-assisted dying, there is a strong consensus that it would only be ethical with respect to voluntary adults who are competent, informed, grievously and irremediably ill, and where the assistance is ‘clearly consistent with the patient’s wishes and best interests, and [provided] in order to relieve suffering’ (para. 358) [2].Whether children and adolescents can have legal access to MAID is a complex question that has yet to be fully considered and adjudicated by Canadian society, in Parliament and through courts of law. Competency can be assessed in children and adolescents in a variety of medical decision-making scenarios but does not resolve the ethical question of who can or should be able to access MAID.To help answer this fundamental question, an appointed Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying advised the government, in a February 2016 report to Parliament (recommendation 6), to:… implement a two-stage legislative process … the first stage applying immediately to competent adult persons 18 years or older, … followed by a second stage applying to competent mature minors …; and That the Government … commit to facilitating a study of the moral, medical and legal issues surrounding the concept of ‘mature minor’ and appropriate competence standards … and that this study include broad-based consultations with health specialists, provincial and territorial child and youth advocates, medical practitioners, academics, researchers, mature minors, families and ethicists … [21].This comprehensive consultation process provides an opportunity to study, reflect on and deliberate MAID issues as they relate to the mature minor population. Key stakeholders with valuable perspectives to share include:The parents/guardians of children and youth who are severely disabled or have terminal illness;Youth who are severely disabled or have a terminal illness;Bereaved parents whose children died from a severe disability or terminal illness; andHealth care professionals who care for such children and youth.A safe and open national dialogue that engages people with a range of backgrounds and diverse customs, beliefs and experiences, is essential for an optimal policy response on this sensitive and complex issue.CANADIAN PAEDIATRICIANS AND MAIDUntil recently, there were no Canada-specific data on the frequency of requests for MAID for minors. Nor were there data reflecting the opinions of Canadian paediatricians on MAID issues generally or their willingness to participate in MAID specifically. In response to this critical knowledge gap, the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) surveyed members and associates using two methods. The first study involved a one-time survey of the 2597 paediatricians who participate in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP-MAID). This tool was designed to document actual requests for MAID by and on behalf of minors (both mature minors and from the parents of infants or children who were considered ‘never competent’). The second study was designed to survey the MAID-related attitudes and opinions of CPS members (CPS-Attitudes). Key findings are summarized below.Exploratory conversations and explicit requests from mature minorsCPSP-MAID had 1050 respondents, a response rate of 40%. Thirty-five respondents reported having had exploratory discussions with 60 minor patients in the preceding year and nine reported explicit requests for MAID from a total of 17 minor patients. Findings indicate that while such consultations may be rare, minors in Canada are contemplating MAID-related concepts and approaching health care providers with MAID-related questions. Given the evolving legislative landscape, it is reasonable to anticipate that such questions will increase in the near future.The CPS-Attitudes survey received 574 responses out of a possible 1979 (a 29% response rate), with only 487 completing all the questions. Almost one-half (46%) of respondents were in favour of extending the MAID option to mature minors experiencing progressive or terminal illness or intractable pain. Fewer believed access should be extended to children or youth with an intolerable disability (29%) or with intolerable mental illness as the sole indication (8%). Thirty-three per cent of respondents said MAID should not be extended to the mature minor population under any circumstance. Regarding eligibility for MAID, 55% of respondents believed that an individual’s capacity was most important, compared with 22% who favoured a minimum stated age.Questions and requests from parents of never-competent children or youthAs of September 2017, both the Federal Act and the Quebec Act clearly prohibit non-voluntary euthanasia for all patients. However, given the human rights framework advanced in Carter v. Canada, the parents of a dying and/or severely disabled child who is deemed to be suffering may, in the near future, be looking to the courts to support a right to end their child’s life. Decision-making for treatment of never-competent children is based on the ‘best interest standard’: choosing among options that reasonable persons, acting in good faith on another’s behalf, would consider acceptable in similar circumstances [22]. In the foreseeable future, parents may challenge health care decisions in court on the grounds that continued life, as experienced by their dying or profoundly disabled child, is not in that child’s best interests.According to the CPSP-MAID study, 118 (11.2%) of participants reported having had exploratory discussions about MAID with parents, on behalf of 419 never-competent patients. No regional variability was evident. Practice types for these respondents included general paediatrics (32%), neonatology (18%) and palliative care (11%). Other specialties were represented by fewer than 10% of respondents.Forty-five respondents reported receiving explicit requests for MAID by parents, on behalf of 91 children, within the previous year. Over one-half of these requests pertained to neonates or infants under a year old. The CPS-Attitudes survey showed less support for parents accessing MAID on behalf of their never-competent children. However, 32% of respondents felt access could be supported in rare situations involving terminal illness or intractable pain, provided that the process was accompanied by significant oversight. Narrative comments from over 100 respondents revealed collective unease or disagreement concerning nonvoluntary euthanasia by parents (i.e., initiated without patient consent). Many narratives described a critical requirement for appropriate safeguards, such that MAID for never-competent children could only be considered by practitioners and parents as a last resort, and only provided that a formal process, with oversight by other external experts, was also in place.THE ROLE OF PALLIATIVE CAREFor all young patients facing life-limiting illness or an illness associated with prolonged suffering, having access to quality, evidence-based, compassionate paediatric palliative care is paramount. Health systems must provide and fund hospital, community and home-based palliative care services, and guarantee universal access to essential care. Current evidence suggests that many patients who could benefit from specialized paediatric palliative care do not receive it [23]–[26]. To meet this critical need, paediatric palliative care specialists need more support, and community-based physicians, nurses and home care providers need enhanced education and skills development.Palliative care and MAID provide philosophically and clinically distinct—though interconnected—medical services. Some parents and clinicians fear palliative care as being focused on death rather than on life, and education around palliative care often involves explaining its essential role in optimizing quality of life for as long as possible. If palliative care physicians were also to engage in the MAID process, some practitioners believe that fear and apprehension might intensify [27]. At the same time, however, palliative care practitioners have acquired invaluable wisdom and experience caring for individuals and families living with advanced illness. Requests for MAID may still arise in the context of excellent palliative care, and the expertise and experience of palliative care specialists must remain available to families considering MAID. Furthermore, paediatric palliative care physicians may also wish to participate in MAID [28], if and when legislative changes extend MAID to some paediatric patients. Irrespective of personal beliefs, access to high quality palliative care must be seamless for those in need, whatever end-of-life options are being contemplated.As Canadian legislation evolves, all requests for assisted death from or on behalf of children and youth must be treated with compassion and respect. Physicians should make sure to elicit and acknowledge the goals, fears, concerns and unmet needs of young patients receiving end-of-life care, and their families. Consultation with palliative care specialists is essential in situations where families are discussing MAID for a minor. Other interdisciplinary team members include spiritual care providers, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and child life specialists. Working together, a palliative care team can provide holistic and supportive counselling for end-of-life decisions. The CPS has a comprehensive statement on advance care planning [23].THE CLINICIAN’S DECISION TO PARTICIPATE IN MAIDEven if Canadian legislation were to evolve toward increasing access to MAID for paediatric patients, the CPS-Attitudes survey suggested that only 19% of responding clinicians would be willing to provide MAID to minors. MAID policy must strike a balance between the rights of patients to ask for medically hastened dying and the rights of physicians to conscientiously object to participating in MAID, especially given the additional considerations when minors are involved. Individual physicians are legally entitled to accept or refuse to participate in MAID. Obligations to inform or possibly refer a patient requesting MAID, however, arise through current professional codes and guidelines.RECOMMENDATIONSAn extensive and inclusive national discussion on MAID eligibility is currently underway in Canada. Access to high quality palliative care is an essential prerequisite for children or youth facing death, including those patients or parents who may be considering or exploring MAID.The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that clinicians advocate within health systems to:Design, fund and deliver child- and youth-focused palliative care, equipped to serve children and families in settings of their choosing, while improving access to palliative care services in homes and communities.To better understand the risks and benefits of extending MAID to mature minors in the Canadian context, the CPS recommends that governments:Evaluate and learn from current MAID policies and experiences for adult patients, both in Canada and elsewhere.Undertake a comprehensive consultation involving: the parents/guardians of children and youth who are severely disabled or terminally ill; youth who are severely disabled or terminally ill; bereaved parents/guardians whose children died from a severe disability or terminal illness; and health care professionals who care for children and youth who are severely disabled or terminally ill.Should legislation eventually permit competent minors to access MAID, the CPS recommends that:Governments at every level develop policies and procedures to safeguard young people from possible risks, harms or abuses of MAID, given their unique vulnerabilities.Procedures for assessing a minor’s personal capacity to make health decisions rest with the patient’s clinical team and parents, in consultation with other designated experts (e.g., bioethicists, psychologists, psychiatrists).The physician’s right not to participate in MAID must be respected, provided they consult and refer requesting patients or families appropriately.AcknowledgementsThis statement was reviewed by the following committees of the Canadian Paediatric Society: Acute Care; Adolescent Health; Community Paediatrics; Fetus and Newborn; and Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, and by the CPS Hospital Paediatrics Section.

The ban will heavily fine any smoker caught with a regular or electronic cigarette while a minor is in the vehicle. Honolulu’s mayor Kirk Caldwell signed the bill into law on October 17, days after the city council approved the measure by a unanimous vote. “They have to breathe in that secondhand smoke, and we know it can cause huge health problems down the road,” Caldwell said. The fines will reportedly go to the person caught smoking by police, who may not be the driver of the car. First time offenders will receive a $100 fine. A second offense will cost smokers $200 and go up to $500 if the person is caught again within a one-year period. It’s not clear how Honolulu police will effectively enforce the ban or determine if a person is under 18 years old without pulling over law-abiding drivers by mistake. City council members expressed confidence in law enforcement to uphold the ban. “HPD, which testified in favor, indicated they’ll do the best to enforce it. Police officers would be on the lookout for people smoking in vehicles,” council chairman Ron Menor said. The 50th state’s capital is the latest community to outlaw smoking around children in cars. Nine other states or U.S. territories – not including Massachusetts – have passed similar bills against smoking around youths under 18.	2017/10/19	factcheck

He reportedly made this announcement just one day after he was sworn in as Attorney General after advice from Obama lawyers in the Department of Justice.Last night, Fox News contributor and legal expert Gregg Jarrett told Sean Hannity that Sessions actually used the wrong law when he announced his recusal after Obama officials purposely misled him.“He betrayed the president,” Jarrett said. “He knew when he was sworn in that he was going to recuse himself and the very next day he put the recusal in motion. He never told the president about that. And by the way he cited the regulation in his recusal… He cited the wrong law. It didn’t apply.”“I think he was being advised badly at the time,” contributor Sara interjected.“Yeah, by Obama’s holdovers. Who in the world would believe them?” Jarrett said. This comes as rumors are swirling that Trump is considering firing Sessions, as the president is still frustrated at him for recusing himself from the Russia probe.“Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said last summer.Last weekend, Sessions said he stands by his decision to step down from the investigation.“I think that’s what I had to do,” Sessions said.Do you think it’s time for Trump to fire Sessions?

(2016 Getty Images)In a few weeks, Malia Obama will leave Pennsylvania Avenue for Madrid’s Serrano Street.President Barack Obama’s eldest daughter is planning to do a summer internship at the U.S. Embassy there, Spanish newspaper ABC is reporting.Malia Obama will turn 18 years old on July 4.After graduating from Sidwell Friends School, she reportedly decided to take a sabbatical year before starting at Harvard University in the fall of 2017.American embassies often take State Department interns during the year, usually recent college graduates. According to ABC, Malia’s decision to intern in the Spanish capital may be related to the Obamas' friendship with the U.S. ambassador in Madrid, James Costos, and his romantic partner of 14 years, interior designer Michael S. Smith.Costos was one of President Obama’s top donors during his reelection campaign in 2012. Before being appointed ambassador, he was a corporate executive in the retail and entertainment industries. Smith was commissioned to redecorate several rooms of the White House for Obama, according to ABC.Malia's Spanish would seem to be fairly functional. During Obama's historic March visit to Cuba, she acted as unofficial translator for her dad.Malia’s internship in Madrid could start as soon as Obama’s official visit to Spain (July 9 to 11) is over, the news outlet reported.According to official information released earlier this month, the president will meet with acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and King Felipe VI.“The visit to Spain, which is an important ally, is aimed at intensifying cooperation in terms of security and strengthening political and economic relations,” the White House said in a statement.The White House added that the president's visit to Europe would be taking place within the context of a NATO meeting that will take place in Warsaw between July 7 and 9.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & InstagramTrending in World	2016/06/28	factcheck

It is so sacred that military veterans have put their lives on the line to make sure that we still have this right in the country. People take voting very seriously. Its one of the essential parts of a democracy.Therefore when it comes out that people are messing with the peoples right to vote, it should be considered a big deal. And that is exactly what is happening in this country.The Democrats have been trying to fix the elections that have been going on in this country. They are doing this to make sure that they remain in power in the White House. Voter fraud has become so rampant that Fox News had a guest come on and say that there are at least four million dead people on U.S. voter rolls.Democrats and Bad Ideas go hand in handThe Democrats Are Trying To Rig The Election!Yes the dead people are voting! Except this isnt a joke like you would hear in Chicago, where the saying is vote early vote often. People that have been dead for years are suddenly rising out of the grave to vote for the Democrats. Elections expert J. Christian Adams has confirmed this and he is one of the leading experts on voting.He was the Voting Section Attorney at the United States Department of Justice, so it is fair to say that he knows what he is talking about. He has filed six lawsuits against Philadelphia and Broward County, Florida, where it was shown that the voter rolls are corruptedWhat the Democrats attempt to do is sue to make sure that the voter rolls stay exactly the way that they are. The reason is because that the current voter rolls greatly benefit the Democratic Party. The data also shows that the dead people that are voting are overwhelmingly in favour of the Democrats.So where is the Obama administration in this? They are doing absolutely nothing! They dont want to do anything because they are in favor of the Democrats. This also shows that the Obama administration is fully in support of the election fraud that is taking place because it will mean that they are going to win some of the elections!Adams has also said, Dead people are voting and its something this administration does not want to do anything about. They must like it. They must like who they are voting for... Now we have four million, four million Steve, ineligible and dead voters on American voter rolls according to the Pew Charitable Trust.Part of this is because of the online voting machines that the country has become used to. Obama has actually sold part of the online vote counting machines to George Soros and his foundation. Yes he has sold them to make sure that the Democrats can retain power that they need.If that means that he is going to take the voting machines that he has bought and make sure that they come up with a pro-Democratic result every single time. But this isnt just affecting the presidential election.This is affecting all election races! That means that all the elections that have Democrats in them, whether its the Senate, the House of Representatives, or even the presidential race, are going to turn out pro-Democratic. As we all know, having control of Congress is crucial to making sure that bills can get passed.Having a Republican controlled Congress would mean that they could pass laws that would be conservative in nature. Not to mention that Congress is also responsible for making sure that some laws that the President doesnt pass can get through.That was the sole reason that the 9/11 bill that would allow members of people that were killed in terrorist attacks are now allowed to file lawsuits against the governments that have sponsored terrorism. President Obama had unsuccessfully tried to veto the bill.Thanks to the Republican controlled Congress that bill was eventually passed and now people that are looking to get justice for their actions are now able to do so. But this is the reason that the Congressional races are just as important as the presidential race.But with Soros controlling part of the online voting machines, the Republican congress members are already at a disadvantage. This also means that they are going to try and pass bills that would further their globalist agendas.Conservative Daily Post has covered the event that the event that had the 9/11 bill passed despite the presidents veto. President Obama has tried to defend the Saudi Arabian government for their actions on 9/11. That is extremely un-American.But Obama has had a history of being un-American. He has released terrorists that have caused damage to the people of the United States. He released a terrorist that was responsible for the deaths of 17 United States sailors!Share this article to show that Obama is doing what he can to rig the election. He doesnt care that there are dead people and illegal people voting because they are voting for the Democrats. That means that he is going to stay in power.This is exactly why we need Donald Trump in office. He is going to put an end to this corruption that the Democrats are responsible for. He will restore the American right to vote.Related Items:ShareTweetShareEmailClick to commentLeave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

He’s actually on tape going ‘motherfucker.’ You cannot turn away.”Simmons is quick to point out that he’s not saying he’s supporting Trump. “He has said some very vile, unkind things,” he says. “But don’t kid yourself. He speaks off the cuff, and what you see is what you get. And he’ll double down. If you ask him about building a wall [between the U.S. and Mexico] he’ll say, ‘Fuck you, I’m going to make it 10 feet higher, just because you asked me.’ He’s not there to be your friend.”What fascinates Simmons is Trump’s ability to root out people’s feelings. “He’s good for the political system,” he says. “The middle, the centrists, they can say, ‘What do you think of this?’ because everybody is sick and tired of being politically correct. Secretly, tens of millions, perhaps 100 million people may actually have some positive feelings about a wall.“Macedonia is building a wall between Greece and Macedonia,” he continues. “There’s a wall between Israel and a neighboring country. There was a Berlin Wall. There was the Great Wall of China. So whether they’re good or bad for people, walls actually work. It’s unkind, but in terms of pragmatics, it actually works … The Pope has said the wall is unkind, but it’s interesting that at the Vatican there’s a wall. They don’t want people on the outside coming into the Vatican.”Ultimately, Simmons feels it will be up to Americans as individuals to make a private decision about Trump’s wall and his ability to be president. One thing he feels he knows for sure, however, is that “this guy has changed politics forever in America.” Showbiz has become politics, the singer says, referencing the way Marco Rubio felt a need to reference the size of Trump’s penis – and Trump replied.“What you can say about politicians is that they’re politicians,” says Simmons, who previously voted for Barack Obama and “in a lot of ways” felt dissatisfied with his decision. “Trump is not a politician. He does not need your money, and he will speak his mind, God damn it, whether you like it or not. And he has no problem saying ‘Fuck off.’“I like that,” Simmons continues. “Even if I disagree.”Watch some of Donald Trump weirdest moments on the campaign trail."	2016/03/30	factcheck

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/nasa-wont-pay-smoke-weed/	NASA Won’t Pay You to Smoke Weed	false	['National', 'fake news', 'NASA']	http://nextshark.com/	http://nextshark.com/drew-iwanicki-nasa-study	2017/05/26	To say the least, 28-year-old Drew Iwanicki took an uncommon path to making some extra cash. Last year, he was a part of a NASA study that paid him $18,000 to lie down in bed for 70 days straight. The study, titled CFT 70 (Countermeasure and Functional Testing in Head-Down Tilt Bed Rest Study), aimed to learn more about how human bone and muscle might deteriorate in space.In 2013, Iwanicki came across a Reddit post advertising the NASA study and applied out of boredom. He told NextShark about the initial process: I assumed that I would never hear anything about the study. But, sure enough, within a week I got a response from the NASA research team following up and asking for some more information. Then I went through probably 20 to 30 pages of my medical history, my familys medical history. Then they asked that I fly out to Texas for a physical examination.From there came a long period of waiting and traveling for examinations. A year from the time he applied, Iwanicki seemed to have lost all hope of getting selected. In August 2014, Iwanicki was unexpectedly laid off from his job as an artist manager. Serendipitously, he received the offer letter to join NASAs bed rest study the very next day.Instead of trying to find a new job, Iwanicki decided he needed a break and accepted NASAs offer, making it the very first research study hes ever participated in. Prior to Iwanicki, there had been 54 participants in the study; Iwanicki would be the last participant for the whole study, chosen out of a pool of 25,000 applicants.It was kind of perfect timing where I wasnt sure what I wanted to do next. Then I saw this crazy opportunity to do a once-in-a-lifetime thing, make a good chunk of money, and also take a step back and reflect on what I wanted my next move to be.Iwanicki told NextShark that the first five days in bed were the most difficult for him because his mind and body were adjusting to a whole new environment:Ive never had any serious type of hospitalization, so the idea of bed rest was a very foreign idea. Then the fact that I was not able to sit up makes it more extreme. Physically, it was a painful experience; the body is not used to laying down for extended periods of time. I experienced some serious headaches because the blood pressure increased in my head. My spine went through some serious pain. Staying horizontal is difficult. Ive been told that it is difficult for the spine to deal with all the pressure of the organs lying on the spine throughout the day.Iwanicki was not allowed to lay down flat like people might normally do. His bed was tilted at a negative six-degree angle with his feet over his head. Fortunately, Iwanicki was allowed to turn to his side and stomach:In the first couple of days, I would curl into the fetal position so I could extend my back and release some of the pressure. I spent most of my day rolling over from my back to my stomach to change things up and relieve some of the pressure on my spine.If that wasnt bad enough, Iwanicki also had to follow a strict sleeping schedule. He explained:I was on a regimented sleep schedule. Lights out at 10 p.m., lights on at 6 a.m. No napping allowed during the day, which is one of the cruelest jokes about being stuck in bed all day, not being able to nap.Iwanicki was monitored via camera 24/7, and the only private time he had was when he needed to urinate or defecate. In order to be able to do so, Iwanicki would push a button, which would summon a nurse to come close the curtains for him. He would then be able to relieve himself in a pee jug or a bedpan while lying down. Iwanicki explained that privacy was one of the things he grew the most appreciation for during his participation:The door to my room was always open, so if I was having a serious or difficult conversation on the phone, certainly the nurses could hear everything that was being said. It was just something I came to terms with.When asked how he showered, Iwanicki said:There was a room that they set up for showers, and I would come in and theyd wheel me over to the shower room where they had a plastic bed set up that I could shower on, and then I had a handheld shower head. So they would shut the door to the place and there was no window to see in or anything like that. I would shower myself.To pass the time, Iwanicki read books, studied for the LSAT, played Starcraft and went on the internet, which he said was average but good enough to stream movies on Netflix.I had a bedside table where I could keep a lot of my things. There was a bracket which could hold my laptop. I would clamp my laptop in and hold it over my head. I would be lying on my back and looking up at my laptop screen; it was pretty comfortable and convenient. But after using the computer for a long period of time I would be holding my arms up in the air, so they would get sore after a while I would have to take breaks to stretch out my arms and muscles. Iwanickis girlfriend also came to visit once, but their physical interactions were greatly limited. She wasnt allowed to be on the bed with him or be intimate. We were allowed to touch each other as far as hold hands, but we werent allowed to be intimate. There was another bed in the room and I asked if she could wheel that bed over and we could lay on it so at least were both at the same angle and she could look straight at my face, but they wouldnt even allow that. So basically for the three days that she came to visit, she just sat in the chair next to my bed. There were some tears and certainly some frustrations during her visit, but I think it was still worth it anyhow. The other part that was hard about that was we had adjusted to this lifestyle where we communicated through Skype and talk on the phone a lot, and then to get the opportunity to see each other and then realize it was going to be another two months before wed see each other face to face was difficult.The couple werent even allowed to share a meal since guests were not permitted to bring outside food into the unit. However, Iwanickis girlfriend may not have been missing much according to Iwanicki, the food was basically cafeteria food and had all been calculated and measured down to the calorie by a dietician so that he would neither gain nor lose weight during the study. He explained:I went into the study at 200 pounds and I left the study at 200 pounds three months later. Some of the other restrictions for the diet were that it had to be very low in salt content. Overall the food was decent.As difficult as it was to eat soup lying down, there was a potato soup that I really liked. There was another day that I would get with grilled cheese with tomato soup and I am a sucker for that. Actually the hamburgers were pretty good. I didnt like the breaded fish cooked in a microwave; it was extra funky.I was allowed 30 minutes to put myself up on my hands and elbows, and I would be allowed to extend my arms above my head, keeping my elbow all the way out and keeping my head up. I was not even allowed to bring my elbow directly below my head and hold myself up further. They were super strict with regulations.It was a little bit difficult in that food just sits in your chest because usually you are sitting up while you eat so you have gravity pushing the food down into your stomach and digestive system. But when you are laying down, it just lingers around your chest area. You get full quickly. You had to clean your plate with no bites left behind. If there were some ketchup on the side, you had to use every bit of ketchup. There were times where some of the condiments came out in funny amounts because they were calculating calories and nutrients. I would get French toast in the morning and they would bring me about four times the syrup that I wanted to use. There were a couple of occasions where I thought that I finished my breakfast and used enough of the syrup but they took a look at my plate and they would tell me to take a shot of syrup and finish my plate after I already had finished the meal.When asked how the numbers worked out in terms of pay, he said:The total, it came out to exactly $17,800 for 108 days, because there is a pre-bed rest period and a post-bed rest period. So, I showed up to NASA three weeks before going into bed rest. I went through a bunch of different testings both before I went into bed rest and after I got out of bed rest so they could look at the differences three weeks prior to bed rest and two weeks after bed rest.While $17,800 sounds like a lot of money, Iwanicki calculates he was paid only $10 for every hour he was awake. However, all expenses like accommodation, food and healthcare were covered during the study. He was paid every two weeks via direct deposit. He said:The money I made there went straight to the bank and for taxes unfortunately. It was sad at the end of the year when I had to cough up $5,000.Participants of the study were allowed to leave at any time if they didnt want to continue with the program. They would simply be paid the hours worked up to the point they quit. However, Iwanicki told NextShark that of the 55 people that participated, none voluntarily quit before the study was over:The people who showed up made it for the long haul. There were a couple they had to release from the study due to medical reasons. One guy could not normalize his heart rate in bed rest after exercise, so because of that they had to release him because of health concerns.On December 2, 2014, the study finally ended and Iwanicki was able to stand for the first time in 70 days. He recounted his experience in a post on Vice:As soon as the bed was tilted to the vertical position, my legs felt heavier than ever before. My heart started to beat at 150 BPMs. My skin became itchy; I was covered in sweat. Blood rushed into my legs, expanding the veins that had become increasingly elastic throughout the past several months of bed rest. I felt like I was going to faint. I was fighting to remain standing from the start, and it only became more difficult. Around the eight-minute mark, my pulse dropped from 150 down to 70. My body was about to collapse. As my vision started to go black, the staff saw my numbers drop on the machines and promptly returned the bed to the horizontal position.No matter how difficult the experience, Iwanicki doesnt regret his decision to do the study:I find myself attracted to these environments of deprivation, in part because it helps me appreciate what I have. Ive always been somebody that thinks the grass is greener on the other side; its just better for me to go to the other side to test it out. In this case I knew it wasnt going to be a pleasant experience, but I also had a tangible understanding that I was going to come out with a new appreciation for my normal life.I can still remember that first moment when I first left the hospital and just felt sunlight on my skin for the first time in two and a half months and I had the biggest smile on my face. To be able to be outside, feel the sun, feel a breeze and not be under fluorescent lights just felt so good. To come home, I remember having fries and ketchup and it being so good. The first beer I had, the first nachos I had, the first burrito I had, it was all so good. Everything had a new shine to it.Since the study ended, Iwanicki has been bitten by the research study bug and continues to find and participate in paid research studies. When asked what it takes to be chosen as a participant, he said:You have to be very healthy. You have to have a completely clean bill of health. You have to be completely clean of any drugs; they test for alcohol, nicotine and caffeine. You cant even be taking applied vitamin pills. Its pretty tricky to get in there, and theres also a big market of people that are trying to get in these studies its a good way to make money, especially for people that arent very qualified for other work. Ive met some crazy characters in these studies. You can also have a criminal record and they dont really care. Its a good way for a felon to make legal money.Currently, Iwanicki is studying for the LSAT with plans to go to law school and manage artists in the music industry, which is his passion.

That’s what the Clinton Foundation has tried to do, by creating opportunities and solving problems faster, better, at lower cost so that more people are empowered to build better futures for themselves, their families, and their communities. I am grateful to everyone in the U.S. and across the world who has been involved in our work, and especially grateful to Chelsea for her role in increasing scope and impact.From day one, the Foundation has pursued its mission through partnerships with governments, the private sector, other foundations, and philanthropists, creating networks of cooperation that are focused on results. In 2005, we convened the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to give people all over the world the chance to do the same thing.These efforts have improved millions of lives around the world. For example:More than 11.5 million people in over 70 countries have access to lifesaving HIV/AIDS drugs at 90 percent lower cost through our affiliated Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) , including more than 800,000 children. That’s more than half the adults and three quarters of the children on treatment today.CHAI has also organized the training of thousands of health care workers as part of an effort to address critical shortages in poor countries and help others build strong, self-sufficient health systems, and expanded access to high-quality, low-cost treatment and diagnostics for many other diseases and conditions.Through our work with the affiliated Alliance for a Healthier Generation , more than 18 million students in over 31,000 American schools, in every state, now have healthier food and more physical activity options, and our agreements with the beverage industry have reduced the caloric intake from drinks by 90 percent in the vast majority of U.S. schools.Our Health Matters Initiative is working in six communities to improve health and has worked with innovative drug companies to help reverse opioid overdoses and combat prescription painkiller misuse by lowering the cost of autoinjection naloxone and making naloxone nasal spray available to every high school in the U.S. at no cost.The Foundation’s Haiti initiative has promoted sustainable investment resulting in the planting of more than 5 million trees, the development of 5 new agricultural supply chains benefiting more than 4,000 smallholder farmers, and support for more than 20 entrepreneurial businesses. And members of CGI’s Haiti Action Network have made more than 100 Commitments to Action to strengthen the health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure sectors.Our climate change projects have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 33,500 tons annually across the U.S. We’ve also partnered on reforestation and land restoration efforts in South America and East Africa, and are working with island nations to develop renewable energy projects and reduce dependence on expensive imported diesel and petroleum.More than 500,000 people in Latin America are benefiting from social enterprises that connect people to job training, supply chains, and entrepreneurship opportunities.More than 105,000 farmers in East Africa have dramatically increased their yields and their incomes.And, through Too Small to Fail (TSTF) , we are working with the faith-based community, pediatricians, community and business leaders, and Head Start educators to provide parents with resources in everyday settings to support their young children’s early brain and language development, and have reached 155,000 parents with tips through direct text messages.I have found great joy in simple moments shared with people who are benefiting from our work: holding a baby who is alive and healthy because he now has access to AIDS medication; planting rows of seeds with smallholder farmers in Malawi and hearing about how our programs have lifted their incomes, enabling them to send their children to school and electrify their homes; meeting with female entrepreneurs in Peru who are earning a good living for the first time in their lives by providing essential goods to their remote communities. This work has been my life for the last 15 years, and I couldn’t be more grateful.“I am grateful to everyone in the U.S. and across the world who has been involved in our work, and especially grateful to Chelsea for her role in increasing scope and impact.”Since Hillary began her presidential campaign in 2015, Chelsea and I have made it clear that the work the Clinton Foundation started should continue if Hillary is elected, but that changes would be necessary. While it would be presumptive to assume a victory in November, now that Hillary is her party’s nominee, it would be irresponsible not to plan for it.If Hillary is elected president, the Foundation’s work, funding, global reach, and my role in it will present questions that must be resolved in a way that keeps the good work going while eliminating legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Over the last several months, members of the Foundation’s senior leadership, Chelsea, and I have evaluated how the Foundation should operate if Hillary is elected. Throughout the process, our top priorities have been preserving our most important programs, supporting the people who work for the Foundation and its affiliated programs, and resolving legitimate conflict of interest questions.If she is elected, we will immediately implement the following changes: The Foundation will accept contributions only from U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and U.S.-based independent foundations, whose names we will continue to make public on a quarterly basis. And we will change the official name from the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation.While I will continue to support the work of the Foundation, I will step down from the Board and will no longer raise funds for it.Much of the Foundation’s international work, like that of most global NGOs, is funded in part by donor governments’ bilateral aid programs. If Hillary is elected, we will transition those programs out of the Foundation to other organizations committed to continuing their work. Doing this in a way that ensures continuity and is respectful of all the employees working around the world will take time. We will complete these transitions as soon as we can do so responsibly.With respect to CHAI, I will step down from the Board. We, along with the CHAI Board, are additionally considering a range of options to ensure that its vital work will continue and will announce details soon.The Clinton Foundation was originally established to build the Clinton Presidential Center and Library in Little Rock , and the work there will continue regardless of the outcome of the election. Since opening its doors 12 years ago, more than 4 million people have visited the Center and it has helped to inspire new generations of leaders — including through the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, a bipartisan educational partnership with the George W. Bush Presidential Center, the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation, and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation. The Center has lived up to my vision and much more, including as an important educational and cultural resource and driver of economic growth for the Little Rock community.Finally, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) has accomplished even more than I dreamed when it began in 2005, and we’ve made the decision that the Annual Meeting this September will be the last, and that we will no longer hold our CGI America meetings. Nine years ago in my book Giving, I wrote, “I want to continue these meetings for at least a decade, with the objective of creating a global network of citizen activists who reach across the divides of our interdependent world to build real communities of shared opportunities, shared responsibilities, and a genuine sense of belonging.” That is exactly what CGI, its members, and its dedicated staff have done.“From day one, the Foundation has pursued its mission through partnerships with governments, the private sector, other foundations, and philanthropists, creating networks of cooperation that are focused on results.”We started CGI to create a new kind of community built around the new realities of our modern world, where problem-solving requires the active partnership of government, business, and civil society. We’ve brought together leaders from across sectors and around the world both to talk about our challenges, and to commit publicly to actually do something about them. It was something different, but our bet paid off: there was a hunger for the chance to make an impact that brought together people and organizations with the resources to make a difference with people who have the knowledge and experience to turn good ideas into action. Corporations, governments, and non-governmental organizations began combining their strengths and finding entirely new approaches to old problems. CGI quickly became an embodiment of what works best in the 21st-century world, and what has been behind all of the Clinton Foundation’s work since the very beginning: networks of cooperation.This partnership model, which may seem self-evident today, was simply not how philanthropy and corporate responsibility worked over a decade ago. Today, members of the Clinton Global Initiative have made more than 3,500 commitments that are already improving over 430 million lives in more than 180 countries. These projects will continue to make an impact around the world and in the U.S. The idea that working together beats going it alone has caught on well beyond our CGI community.It’s been one of the great honors of my life to be part of this special community, and I hope the hard work and benefits of CGI’s great staff and its members’ creative cooperation will keep rippling out into the world. The commitment model has been adopted by other forums and I hope that more will do so, or that new organizations will arise to do this work. While this year will be the last for the CGI Annual Meeting and CGI America, I hope and believe we can and should preserve CGI University (CGI U) , our meeting that brings university students together to develop innovative solutions to important challenges in the U.S. and around the world.“This partnership model, which may seem self-evident today, was simply not how philanthropy and corporate responsibility worked over a decade ago.”In addition to continuing CGI U and all of the activities of the Clinton Presidential Center, the Foundation will also continue those domestic programs that can be maintained with the funding restrictions we announced today.The process of determining the Clinton Foundation’s future if Hillary becomes President has not been easy. It’s an unprecedented situation, so there’s no blueprint to follow. Part of what has made the Foundation successful over the last 15 years has been our understanding that solving problems and creating opportunities faster, better, and in the most cost-effective way sometimes means changing course.Working alongside so many passionate people around the world who share our goals and believe in our approach has made these 15 years one of the most rewarding chapters of my life, as I know it has been for Chelsea. While my role in that work will change, the work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it.Chelsea and I are very proud of what the Clinton Foundation, its affiliates, and its partners have accomplished, and we are profoundly grateful to the staff, to those who have funded our work, and to all the people with whom we have worked and from whom we have learned so much. We will try to be faithful to them, their values, and their work in effecting this transition as quickly and effectively as possible.	2016/08/22	factcheck

Temporary scheduling order. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is issuing this temporary scheduling order to schedule six synthetic cannabinoids: methyl 2-(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate [5F-ADB; 5F-MDMB-PINACA]; methyl 2-(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3-methylbutanoate [5F-AMB]; N-(adamantan-1-yl)-1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide [5F-APINACA, 5F-AKB48]; N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide [ADB-FUBINACA]; methyl 2-(1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate [MDMB-CHMICA, MMB-CHMINACA] and methyl 2-(1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate [MDMB-FUBINACA], and their optical, positional, and geometric isomers, salts, and salts of isomers into schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. This action is based on a finding by the Administrator that the placement of these synthetic cannabinoids into schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this order, the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances will be imposed on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis, or possess), or propose to handle, 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA. This temporary scheduling order is effective on April 10, 2017. This temporary order will expire on April 10, 2019, unless it is extended for an additional year or a permanent scheduling proceeding is completed. Michael J. Lewis, Diversion Control Division, Drug Enforcement Administration; Mailing Address: 8701 Morrissette Drive, Springfield, Virginia 22152; Telephone: (202) 598-6812. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) implements and enforces titles II and III of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, as amended. 21 U.S.C. 801-971. Titles II and III are referred to as the “Controlled Substances Act” and the “Controlled Substances Import and Export Act,” respectively, and are collectively referred to as the “Controlled Substances Act” or the “CSA” for the purpose of this action. The DEA publishes the implementing regulations for these statutes in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), chapter II. The CSA and its implementing regulations are designed to prevent, detect, and eliminate the diversion of controlled substances and listed chemicals into the illicit market while ensuring an adequate supply is available for the legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States. Controlled substances have the potential for abuse and dependence and are controlled to protect the public health and safety. Under the CSA, every controlled substance is classified into one of five schedules based upon its potential for abuse, its currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and the degree of dependence the drug or other substance may cause. 21 U.S.C. Start Printed Page 17120812. The initial schedules of controlled substances established by Congress are found at 21 U.S.C. 812(c), and the current list of all scheduled substances is published at 21 CFR part 1308. Section 201 of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 811, provides the Attorney General with the authority to temporarily place a substance into schedule I of the CSA for two years without regard to the requirements of 21 U.S.C. 811(b) if he finds that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1). In addition, if proceedings to control a substance are initiated under 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1), the Attorney General may extend the temporary scheduling for up to one year. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2). Where the necessary findings are made, a substance may be temporarily scheduled if it is not listed in any other schedule under section 202 of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 812, or if there is no exemption or approval in effect for the substance under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. 355. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1). The Attorney General has delegated scheduling authority under 21 U.S.C. 811 to the Administrator of the DEA. 28 CFR 0.100. Section 201(h)(4) of the CSA 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(4), requires the Administrator to notify the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of his intention to temporarily place a substance into schedule I of the CSA. The Acting Administrator transmitted notice of his intent to place 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA into schedule I on a temporary basis to the Assistant Secretary by letter dated April 22, 2016. The Assistant Secretary responded to this notice by letter dated May 2, 2016, and advised that based on a review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there were no investigational new drug applications or approved new drug applications for 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA. The Assistant Secretary also stated that the HHS had no objection to the temporary placement of 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA into schedule I of the CSA. The DEA has taken into consideration the Assistant Secretary's comments as required by 21 U.S.C. 811 (h)(4). 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA are not currently listed in any schedule under the CSA, and no exemptions or approvals are in effect for 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA under section 505 of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. 355. The DEA has found that the control of 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA in schedule I on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, and as required by 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1)(A), a notice of intent to temporarily schedule 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA or MDMB-FUBINACA was published in the Federal Register on December 21, 2016. 81 FR 93595. To find that placing a substance temporarily into schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, the Administrator is required to consider three of the eight factors set forth in section 201(c) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 811(c): The substance's history and current pattern of abuse; the scope, duration and significance of abuse; and what, if any, risk there is to the public health. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3). Consideration of these factors includes actual abuse, diversion from legitimate channels, and clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3). A substance meeting the statutory requirements for temporary scheduling may only be placed into schedule I. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1). Substances in schedule I are those that have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(1). Available data and information for 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA, summarized below, indicate that these synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. The DEA's three-factor analysis, and the Assistant Secretary's May 2, 2016 letter are available in their entirety under the tab “Supporting Documents” of the public docket of this action at www.regulations.gov under FDMS Docket ID: DEA-2016-0020 (Docket Number DEA-446). Factor 4. Synthetic cannabinoids have been developed over the last 30 years as tools for investigating the endocannabinoid system (e.g., determining CB1 and CB2 receptor activity). The first encounter of SCs within the United States occurred in November 2008 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Since then the popularity of SCs and their associated products has increased steadily as evidenced by law enforcement seizures, public health information, and media reports. 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA are SCs that have been recently encountered (see “Supporting and Related Material,” factor 5). Multiple overdoses involving emergency medical intervention or deaths have been associated with 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA. Research and clinical reports have demonstrated that SCs are applied onto plant material so that the material may be smoked as users attempt to obtain a euphoric and/or psychoactive “high,” believed to be similar to marijuana. Data gathered from published studies, supplemented by discussions on Internet discussion Web sites, demonstrate that these products are being abused mainly by smoking for their psychoactive properties. The adulterated products are marketed as “legal” alternatives to marijuana. In recent overdoses, 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA have been shown to be applied onto plant material, similar to the SCs that have been previously available. Law enforcement personnel have encountered various application methods, including buckets or cement mixers, in which plant material and one or more SCs (including 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and/or MDMB-FUBINACA) are mixed together, as well as large areas where the plant material is spread out so that a dissolved SC Start Printed Page 17121mixture can be applied directly. Once mixed, the SC plant material is then allowed to dry before manufacturers package the product for distribution, ignoring any control mechanisms to prevent contamination or to ensure a consistent, uniform concentration of the substance in each package. Adverse health consequences may also occur from directly ingesting the substance(s) during the manufacturing process. 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA, similar to other SCs, have been encountered in the form of dried leave or herbal blends. The designer drug products laced with SCs, including 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA, are often sold under the guise of “herbal incense” or “potpourri,” use various product names, and are routinely labeled “not for human consumption.” Additionally, these products are marketed as a “legal high” or “legal alternative to marijuana” and are readily available over the Internet, in head shops, or sold in convenience stores. There is an incorrect assumption that these products are safe, that they are a synthetic form of marijuana, and that labeling these products as “not for human consumption” is a legal defense to criminal prosecution. A major concern, as reiterated by public health officials and medical professionals, is the targeting and direct marketing of SCs and SC-containing products to adolescents and youth. This is supported by law enforcement encounters and reports from emergency departments; however, all age groups have been reported by media as abusing these substances and related products. Individuals, including minors, are purchasing SCs from Internet Web sites, gas stations, convenience stores, and head shops. Factor 5. SCs, including 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA, continue to be encountered on the illicit market regardless of scheduling actions that attempt to safeguard the public from the adverse effects and safety issues associated with these substances. Numerous substances are encountered each month, differing only by small modifications intended to avoid prosecution while maintaining the pharmacological effects. Law enforcement and health care professionals continue to report abuse of these substances and their associated products. As described by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), many substances being encountered in the illicit market, specifically SCs, have been available for years but have reentered the marketplace due to a renewed popularity. The threat of serious injury to the individual following the ingestion of 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA and other SCs persists. Numerous calls have been received by poison centers regarding the abuse of products potentially laced with SCs that have resulted in visits to emergency departments. Law enforcement continues to encounter novel SCs on the illicit market, including 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA (see factor 5 in “Supporting and Related Material”). The following information details information obtained through NFLIS (queried on November 7, 2016), including dates of first encounter, exhibits/reports, and locations. 5F-ADB: NFLIS-2,311 reports, first encountered in September 2014, locations include: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin. 5F-AMB: NFLIS-3,349 reports, first encountered in January 2014, locations include: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 5F-APINACA: NFLIS-1,936 reports, first encountered in August 2012, locations include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. ADB-FUBINACA: NFLIS—942 reports, first encountered in March 2014, locations include: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. MDMB-CHMICA: NFLIS—227 reports, first encountered in March 2015, locations include: Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. MDMB-FUBINACA: NFLIS—507 reports, first encountered in July 2015, locations include: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. Factor 6. 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA have all been identified in overdose and/or cases involving death attributed to their abuse. Adverse health effects reported from these incidents involving 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and/or MDMB-FUBINACA have included: Nausea, persistent vomiting, agitation, altered mental status, seizures, convulsions, loss of consciousness and/or cardio toxicity. Large clusters of overdoses requiring medical care have been reported involving 5F-AMB, MDMB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and 5F-ADB. Reported deaths involving these SCs have included 5F-ADB (8); 5F-AMB (6); 5F-APINACA (1); ADB-FUBINACA (2); and MDMB-CHMICA (4). The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has reported an additional 12 deaths involving MDMB-CHMICA; and MDMB-FUBINACA (1) (see factor 6 in “Supporting and Related Material”). In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3), based on the available data and information summarized above, the continued uncontrolled manufacture, distribution, importation, exportation, conduct of research and chemical Start Printed Page 17122analysis, possession, and abuse of 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA pose an imminent hazard to the public safety. The DEA is not aware of any currently accepted medical uses for these substances in the United States. A substance meeting the statutory requirements for temporary scheduling, 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1), may only be placed into schedule I. Substances in schedule I are those that have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Available data and information for 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA indicate that these SCs have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. As required by section 201(h)(4) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(4), the Administrator, through a letter dated April 22, 2016, notified the Assistant Secretary of the DEA's intention to temporarily place these six substances into schedule I. A notice of intent was subsequently published in the Federal Register on December 21, 2016. 81 FR 93595. In accordance with the provisions of section 201(h) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 811(h), the Administrator considered available data and information, and herein set forth the grounds for his determination that it is necessary to temporarily schedule methyl 2-(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate [5F-ADB; 5F-MDMB-PINACA]; methyl 2-(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3-methylbutanoate [5F-AMB]; N-(adamantan-1-yl)-1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamide [5F-APINACA, 5F-AKB48]; N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamide [ADB-FUBINACA]; methyl 2-(1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1 H-indole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate [MDMB-CHMICA, MMB-CHMINACA] and methyl 2-(1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate [MDMB-FUBINACA] into schedule I of the CSA to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Because the Administrator hereby finds it necessary to temporarily place these SCs into schedule I to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, this temporary order scheduling these substances will be effective on the date of publication in the Federal Register, and will be in effect for a period of two years, with a possible extension of one additional year, pending completion of the regular (permanent) scheduling process. 21 U.S.C. 811(h) (1) and (2). The CSA sets forth specific criteria for scheduling a drug or other substance. Permanent scheduling actions in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(a) are subject to formal rulemaking procedures done “on the record after opportunity for a hearing” conducted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557. 21 U.S.C. 811. The permanent scheduling process of formal rulemaking affords interested parties with appropriate process and the government with any additional relevant information needed to make a determination. Final decisions that conclude the permanent scheduling process of formal rulemaking are subject to judicial review. 21 U.S.C. 877. Temporary scheduling orders are not subject to judicial review. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(6). 1. Registration.

Liability. Any activity involving 5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and/or MDMB-FUBINACA not authorized by, or in violation of the CSA, occurring as of April 10, 2017, is unlawful, and may subject the person to administrative, civil, and/or criminal sanctions. Section 201(h) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 811(h), provides for a temporary scheduling action where such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As provided in this subsection, the Attorney General may, by order, schedule a substance in schedule I on a temporary basis. Such an order may not be issued before the expiration of 30 days from (1) the publication of a notice in the Federal Register of the intention to issue such order and the grounds upon which such order is to be issued, and (2) the date that notice of the proposed temporary scheduling order is transmitted to the Assistant Secretary. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1). Inasmuch as section 201(h) of the CSA directs that temporary scheduling actions be issued by order and sets forth the procedures by which such orders are to be issued, the DEA believes that the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) at 5 U.S.C. 553, do not apply to this temporary scheduling action. In the alternative, even assuming that this action might be subject to 5 U.S.C. 553, the Administrator finds that there is good cause to forgo the notice and comment requirements of section 553, as any further delays in the process for issuance of temporary scheduling orders would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest in view of the manifest urgency to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Further, the DEA believes that this temporary scheduling action is not a “rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 601(2), and, accordingly, is not subject to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). The requirements for the preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis in 5 U.S.C. 603(a) are not applicable where, as here, the DEA is not required by the APA or any other law to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking. Additionally, this action is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), section 3(f), and, accordingly, this action has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This action will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) it is determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. As noted above, this action is an order, not a rule. Accordingly, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) is inapplicable, as it applies only to rules. However, if this were a rule, pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, “any rule for which an agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, shall take effect at such time as the federal agency promulgating the rule determines. 5 U.S.C. 808(2). It is in the public interest to schedule these substances immediately because they pose a public health risk. This temporary scheduling action is taken pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(h), which is specifically designed to enable the DEA to act in an expeditious manner to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. 21 U.S.C. 811(h) exempts the temporary scheduling order from standard notice and comment rulemaking procedures to ensure that the process moves swiftly. For the same reasons that underlie 21 U.S.C. 811(h), that is, the need to move quickly to place these substances into schedule I because they pose an imminent hazard to public safety, it would be contrary to the public interest to delay implementation of the temporary scheduling order. Therefore, this order shall take effect immediately upon its publication. The DEA has submitted a copy of this temporary order to both Houses of Congress and to the Comptroller General, although such filing is not required under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Congressional Review Act), 5 U.S.C. 801-808, because, as noted above, this action is an order, not a rule. 1. 2. (11) methyl 2-(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3-methylbutanoate, its optical, positional, and geometric isomers, salts and salts of isomers (Other names: 5F-AMB). Dated: April 4, 2017. Acting Administrator. 1. Though DEA has used the term “final order” with respect to temporary scheduling orders in the past, this notification adheres to the statutory language of 21 U.S.C. 811(h), which refers to a “temporary scheduling order.” No substantive change is intended. 2. As discussed in a memorandum of understanding entered into by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the FDA acts as the lead agency within the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) in carrying out the Secretary's scheduling responsibilities under the CSA, with the concurrence of NIDA. 50 FR 9518, Mar. 8, 1985. The Secretary of the HHS has delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the HHS the authority to make domestic drug scheduling recommendations. 58 FR 35460, July 1, 1993. 3. The National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) is a national drug forensic laboratory reporting system that systematically collects results from drug chemistry analyses conducted by state and local forensic laboratories in the United States. 4. A publication error occurred with the December 21, 2016 notification (81 FR 93595), which resulted in 21 CFR 1308.11 being amended. As a result, a correction was issued by the Federal Register on January 9, 2017 (82 FR 2218), and the amended text was removed. The original notice of intent was republished on January 9, 2017 (82 FR 2280), with the corrected non-amendatory language. [FR Doc.	2017/04/10	factcheck

If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it. This is not news to most readers, but the intricacies of Soros’s operations surely are. Here is a first in a series of articles to illuminate a real arch villain. Today we will focus on Soros and the American presidency.In America a surreal presidential race is winding toward its ultimate crescendo. In a symphony of unbelief, a people of a once great nation are serenaded by two bitterly sour notes droning in the air. “Hillary for president” leaves people of any real moral fortitude screaming inside their heads, as if they’ve been blasted with a shrieking air raid siren. As for Donald Trump’s bid for America’s highest office, jittery liberals and conservatives alike shudder at the thought of “The Donald’s” first state of the union address. Neither major candidate is what anyone would call “presidential”. Election 2016 is going exactly as manipulators like George Soros planned. Another presidency is set to be owned, lock-stock-and-barrel, by the biggest thieves in the world.Donald Trump is the ideal fall guy to set up Hillary Clinton. Boisterous, controversial, and very scary, the notorious billionaire developer is like Ronald Reagan with a penchant for acting like the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. If Trump brought two six shooters to his next speech, and lifted himself off the ground by unloading both at his feet, scarcely anyone would be surprised. The reason he was chosen to run is transparent, no one else on Earth possesses the same divergent qualities. Trump is at once a credible celebrity power figurine, and at the same time totally unacceptable as a realistic choice. Stay tuned, there is method to the madness.News George Soros has committed more than $25 million to Hillary and the now defunct Democratic Party is no surprise. It was Soros who helped ram Barack Obama down America’s throat. The New York billionaire has a history with Hillary and husband, dating back to Bill’s administration. It is in this relationship we see a rather diabolical pattern, if we look closely enough. No American schoolteacher will ever recount how an American president helped topple a legitimate and thriving nation like Yugoslavia, but a George Soros may certainly be implicated. When Soros created “Soros Yugoslavia”, it was not to elevate the people of that nation. Read the recap at Open Society Foundations today, if you believe I am dreaming up conspiracies. Soros is so proud of his efforts to destroy Yugoslavia, he’s commissioned a booklet enumerating his efforts entitled; “Building Open Society in the Western Balkans, 1991-2011”. Soros is, if anything a captain of the banking elite, a nation state destroyer, and a builder of a world of indebted peoples. His mission requires control of the US presidency, and a free hand in building revised nations in need of cash to rebuild. The mission is twofold. First create a credit vacuum with upheaval and civil war, then fill the void with selected investor capital, creating armies of Open Society collaborators. It’s safe to say that a large percentage of academics, media, and governmental players you see at work today, were “recruited” by Soros and others in the game. But let’s not venture too far afield, it’s the presidency-Soros connection we aim to illuminate.A few years before George Soros and the Yugoslavian puppet ruler Ante Marković signed the deal for establishing the Soros Yugoslavia efforts, Soros and the westerners were instrumental in helping break apart the government of Branko Mikulić, the $21 billion in debt to western bankers being insufficient to the Soros types. In his stead, Ante Marković was put in place as the last leader of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Then the country began to melt down, Clinton played his role, and a war shattered lives and infrastructure, and credit would need to be extended. Instead of the $21 billion Yugoslavia owed, 7 weaker states would be formed up to become satraps. This is the irrefutable ends, to which Soros’s and Bill Clinton’s strategies were aimed. Yugoslavia, a stable buffer in between rampant capitalism and new eastern ideas, it was destroyed. The legacy of Prime Minister Tito died a horrible death, one revisionist historians were paid to whitewash. And make no mistake, George Soros is chief among the revisionists. Key opposition players like Slobodan Milošević (“Sloba”) were the predecessors of Libya’s Gaddafi, and Saddam Hussein, you see. Useful for the Americans and Brits for a time, these authoritarians were backstabbed, betrayed, once their usefulness was at an end. Milošević was more or less murdered, left to get sicker and die in a Hague prison, and without any substantial proof of the crimes he was charged with. Clinton led NATO to bomb the hell out of Yugoslavia, and then trumped up allegations just as Bush did in Iraq.Soros’s inside man, Ante Marković is dead now along with most of the other bigger players in the Balkans conversion. All anyone really knows about Soros Yugoslavia is, a week after approval was granted by Marković, Yugoslavia disintegrated leaving behind what author and European expert Bat Ye’or called “Eurabia”, or a Muslim state in the heart of Europe. The BBC back then was a lot more on the level:“President Clinton has authorized an all-out campaign to topple Slobodan Milosevic, according to sources close to the US Government. Earlier this spring, Mr. Clinton signed a secret presidential ‘finding’ giving the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the green light to try to bring down the Yugoslav president, said sources quoted in the US news-magazine Time.”This report on the New English Reviews by Ares Demertzis, is detailed in revealing what the author called “Bill Clinton’s Bastard Army”. Open Society Foundations dogma today puts forward “Soros history” on the 1989 – 1991 situations, at least loosely. However, the real story behind Yugoslavia’s internal pressures is not just overlooked, but hidden. This quote via Global Research , from former NATO supreme commander, General Wesley Clark, it tells us just how the Balkans became so fragmented after Tito’s death.“From 1979, he (Soros) distributed $3 million a year to dissidents including Poland’s solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union. In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary and pumped millions of dollars into opposition movements and independent media. Ostensibly aimed at building up a ‘civil society”, these initiatives were designed to weaken the existing political structures and pave the way for eastern Europe’s eventual exploitation by global capital. Soros now claims with characteristic immodesty, that he was responsible for the “Americanization” of Eastern Europe.”As you can glean from all this, the Soros types of the world are not geniuses, but practitioners. Templates for success, templates for profit, this is all these people know. The purposes may be seen in a manifest diversity of money streams and policy motifs here, but it all boils down to the narrow minded focus of limited intellect. The Rothschilds and Rockefellers, and their Soros minions win on the margins, they win on the wars, and the win on building back civilizations. This is not rocket science; it is not even innovative economic theorem. Tearing countries down to scarf up their resources, the Robber Baron strategies of old, neo-colonialism, whatever we call it – it is mediocre and lazy. But this is simply my opinion of these so-called “banksters”. I am really sorry for them, for their legacies could be cemented in the finest marble, carved into our highest peaks, and into the hearts of generations. Instead, they plod like pitiful predators, too greedy to even fear death.Look at the world today. News that a taxpayer-funded pressure group called Media Diversity Institute (MDI) is demanding the media promote only positive views of minorities in Europe may seem just a liberal footnote for more. Learning that MDI is funded by the European Commission, George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, and the United Nations shows how deeply entrenched Soros interests and his methods have become. In 2014 Open Society Foundations funded an MDI project to counter so called “xenophobic attitudes” in order to paint migration more positively in the midst of the European Union election campaign. While Russophobia and other forms of discrimination are promoted, Soros and his allies continually point the finger at the victims, calling concerned European citizens names, chastising any effort contrary to “the goal”, which is certainly to finalize global conquest by the banking elite.Soros funding of the Clinton campaigns, the Obama campaign, and his feigned dislike for the likes of the Bush presidents is a deadly game. Soros is the ultimate henchman of the men behind. And believe me, they are mostly men. Right now the United States of America is undergoing dramatic change too, though few can see this. Truth be told, most people in the region formerly known as Yugoslavia fail to grasp what was taken from them. What Soros and his handlers always count on, it the local and personal focus human beings are possessed of. An American factory worker is happy just to have a job. Little does he know that without these mediocre leaders, he might have retired by now. In Croatia or Montenegro, a laborer is incapable of seeing his or her role in a massively successful Yugoslavian society. Lost potential is the most fleeting realities. Soros types continually manipulate and fool all of us into being satisfied with less, while promising much more.Soros destroys, then professes good, does evil, and has the people pay for their own misery. Then he loans them hope, sells them the illusion of a new society, a better world, as the Rothschilds take a cut. They get governments to tax us, then fund their indebtedness plans, and blame any problems on all adversaries. It’s nice game for them, even if unimaginative, but its effectiveness is running out. Maybe this is why today’s crisis seems so desperate, why a Trump must run against a second Clinton, and why Europe has to call the terrorists a taxi to their next killing.Phil Butler, is a policy investigator and analyst, a political scientist and expert on Eastern Europe, exclusively for the online magazine “New Eastern Outlook” .	2015/10/24	factcheck

Wikipedia Commons/AjepbahThe Local9 June 201717:29 CEST+02:00US President Donald Trump reportedly struggled at first to find a place to stay on his first official visit to Germany. But the Hamburg city government has come to his rescue, German media report.Is it just that there wasn’t any space left in the inn?With 6,000 delegates set to attend the G20 summit in Hamburg in July, plus security personnel and several thousand journalists, there is high demand for rooms in the port city.So maybe this is the reason that the swanky Four Seasons Hotel told Trump back in April that they couldn’t offer him a room for the event, despite having hosted former Secretary of State John Kerry in December, according to a report in the Hamburger Abendblatt.Rumour had it that the US President’s team had been unable to find him suitable accommodation in the port city, deciding instead to book him a room in Berlin and fly him to Hamburg for the summit on each of the two days.But Bild reported on Friday that the White House has now secured a roof over the President’s well-coiffed head.The Hamburg city government has offered Trump a villa it uses as a guest house, according to the tabloid.US Secret Service teams are set to visit the location next week with German colleagues to assess its security.

The aquifer is located beneath the surface of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and is the second largest-known aquifer system in the world.Reported by Correiodo Brasil the major transnational conglomerates are “striding forward” with their negotiations to privatize the aquifer system. Meetings have already been reserved with authorities of the current government, such as Michel Temer, to outline procedures required for private companies to exploit the water sources. The concession contracts will last more than 100 years. The first public conversation about this dilemma was scheduled on the same day the process of voting for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff was opened. As Central Politico reports, “This coincidence was fatal for the adjournment of the meeting.”“There must be another list of projects to be granted or privatized in the medium term, with auctions that may occur in up to one year, such as Eletrobras energy distributors and freshwater sources,” adds the news site, translated via Google from Portuguese.This issue extends beyond South America, as all humans will be affected by the decision to privatize the second-largest aquifer system in the world. Essentially, the corporations are profiting off a natural resource that should be freely available to all.Under the Guarani Aquifer Project’s Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development Project, known as ANA’s Guarani Aquifer Project (SAG), the aquifer would be managed and preserved for present and future generations. Following the conservatives’ victory in Argentina and the coup d’état, pressed for by the ultra right in Paraguay and Brazil, only Uruguay was left to vote on the privatization of the aquifer.Approximately two-thirds (1.2 million km²) of the reserve is located in Brazilian territory, specifically in the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Future generations will ultimately suffer if this deal goes through, which is why human rights organizations around the world are getting involved.“Organized civil society is alert to possible privatization strategies of transnational economic groups. Since 2003, the Organization of American States (OAS) and the World Bank, through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), have implemented the Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development project to gather and develop research on the Guarani Aquifer , with the objective of implementing a common institutional, legal and technical model for MERCOSUR countries,” says a document from the Human Rights Organization Terra de Direitos.Nothing will change if we, as a populace, sit idly by and watch greedy individuals exploit the environment and snatch precious resources from present and future generations.

Insurance companies would be allowed to reduce coverage and to force patients to pay more out of pocket, meaning plans would provide less value to the consumer.Watch the video below from Fox News.Don't let Silicon Valley control what you see.

I do think the standard is too high,” the nation’s top law enforcement officer told NBC News . “There needs to be a change with regard to the standard of proof.”Holder told Politico there should be “serious consideration” to lowering the bar for such investigations. There are many ongoing – just like the protests led by people with increasingly lower expectations of the government but insistently high hopes for a grassroots movement they say is just getting started.graphic of deathsCompiled by Tom McCarthy; illustrations by Nate Kitch/The Guardian“Sadly, I wish I could say I was surprised,” Ashley Yates of Millennial Activists United said of the Martin investigation. “This is yet another example of how the American justice system, as it stands, does not work for black people.”Calls for the implementation of a so-called Trayvon’s Law, drafted by the historic National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and supported by the thousands of young protesters, have also fallen flat in states around the country.The draft law called for an end to racial profiling, a repeal of stand-your-ground laws, which contributed to Zimmerman’s self-defense claims, and an end to the “school-to-prison pipeline” by rolling back on zero-tolerance disciplinary proceedings in education.The Justice Department decision – based on the high threshold for federal charges – has not just dealt a blow to Martin’s family, who have maintained their fight for justice for going on 1,100 days. So have the families of many other young people. But coupled with the lack of progress on other reforms both locally and nationally, the end of the federal investigation into Martin’s death has raised an occasion for questions about whether the ongoing movement will be able to achieve its goals, and if it does, what the next steps might be.‘We have lost faith in these institutions’Dream Defenders formed in the wake of the Martin killing. Agnew, then a pharmaceutical salesman, organised a small march of around 50 people from Daytona Beach to Sanford, the city where Martin was killed. Now the group is widely credited with bringing activism surrounding the case into the national spotlight. Agnew himself was one of seven young leaders to meet with Barack Obama as the president’s policing task force set to work. (Its first set of recommendations is expected on Monday.)Agnew’s organisation boast chapters in seven cities around the state. It staged the largest sit-in in Florida’s history, a 31-day protest outside Florida governor Rick Scott’s office in July 2013 after Zimmerman’s acquittal and sent a representative to the United Nations calling for an overhaul of stand-your-ground laws.Yet calls for legislative change in Florida have failed and stand-your-ground laws have been expanded . At least 22 states still have stand-your-ground laws on their books, according to a report released late last year by Everytown for Gun Safety .For Agnew, who is resolute that this week’s Justice Department decision will not signal an end of organising around Martin’s case, the legislative setbacks are emblematic of a wider political gulf.“Now we will decide what justice looks like,” he says, “It will no longer be up to prosecutors, district attorneys, the DoJ, institutions and people that specialize in [political] theatre nor have any regard for love and justice to decide what ‘Justice for Trayvon’ means.“The center of the matter now, is that we have lost faith in these institutions that readily serve false hopes and promises.”But just what that new form of justice might look like – with demands often as unclear as their responses – remains vastly unclear.“Unfortunately, this movement is fighting for a lot of the rights our elders thought they had secured during the wins arising from the civil rights movement,” said Yates, who also met with Obama at the White House late last year. “But we have sadly seen … the wins obtained through Brown v Board, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act have been circumvented by failing school systems, the school to prison pipeline, red-lining, gentrification, voter ID laws.”The anger that seethed outside the Florida courthouse when a jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder in July 2013 reverberated a year and a half later on the streets of Ferguson when a grand jury declined to charge a white officer over the shooting death of Brown, and just days later on Staten Island, where a grand jury there decided to bring no charges against a New York police officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner .Black Lives Matter emerged as the most cohesive movement, with membership across the country and sweeping demands – if not exactly an organisational structure as familiar as establishment civil rights groups. Many smaller groups and coalitions also formed in the wake of the 2014 police killings, but have failed, at least so far, to bring about major changes to local and federal law.Michael McPhearson, executive director of Veterans for Peace and a member of the Don’t Shoot Coalition, remains optimistic about institutional and legislative change. He cited the long history of the civil rights movement as evidence that such cultural shifts take time.“We like to romanticize the civil rights movement, but it took over a decade to really manifest itself to where the kind of changes we needed to see happen actually happened,” McPhearson said. “You’re not going to see a movement succeed in seven months or a year.”The demands of the Don’t Shoot Coalition, which was formed in the aftermath of Brown’s death, are local and threefold: end racial profiling in the St Louis metro area, bring in better tools to hold law enforcement officers accountable, and build police departments that reflect the communities they serve.McPhearson said he was not discouraged by the slow and piecemeal progress, legislatively or otherwise, that’s been made in the years since Martin’s death.“The struggle is long,” he said. “And post-civil rights movement, this is clearly the most activity that you’ve seen from a large swath of the black community, taking interest and actually being very active in the streets and demanding changes. I really don’t think that that’s going to go away.“I’m not expecting there to be a savior,” McPhearson said. “Change has to come from us.”‘Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago’A single gunshot wound to the chest meant Martin would never realize his college dreams.The teenager was walking back from a convenience store in Sanford, where he had gone to buy a packet of Skittles and a can of iced tea.Zimmerman, who saw Martin walking through his neighborhood in a now infamous grey hoodie, called 911 and associated the innocent 17-year-old with a recent spate of crime in the gated community he patrolled. He pursued him against the advice of officers who picked up the emergency call and shot him dead from near point-blank range after an altercation.“He took a life, carelessly and recklessly, and he shouldn’t deserve to have his entire life walking around on the street free,” Sybrina Fulton, Martin’s mother, told the Associated Press on Wednesday . “I just believe that he should be held accountable for what he’s done.”On Thursday, Obama once again made reference to the case , as Fulton and Trayvon’s father, Tracy, were received at the White House for a Black History Month event.“Showing all of our kids – all of them, every single day – that their lives matter, that’s part of our task,” Obama said. “Where we are today didn’t come easy. It came through thick and thin.”Following Zimmerman’s acquittal, Obama unexpectedly compared the 17-year-old to himself at the same age. “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” he said. The president hasn’t said anything quite so strident on the killing of young black men since.Three years later, the end of the federal investigation into Zimmerman will probably be the final formal attempt for a conviction. Martin’s parents, through their attorney Benjamin Crump, told the Guardian they had no plans to launch a civil claim. Fulton said she would prefer to channel her grief into the foundation she established in her son’s honor. The Trayvon Martin Foundation helps support and advocate for families who have lost children to violence.Crump himself has gone on to represent the families of Brown and Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy shot dead by Cleveland police, whose case has also been taken up by the Black Lives Matter movement.And though change will certainly be hard-fought, the protesters’ regular marches, “die-ins” and events continue – and their demands are being heard. Earlier this week, the head of the nation’s largest police force, the New York police commissioner, Bill Bratton, told an audience during a Black History Month event that “many of the worst parts of black history would have been impossible without police, too.”Just days earlier, the director of the FBI, James Comey, acknowledged in a major speech on race and law enforcement that Americans must accept that racism is the country’s “cultural inheritance” and that police officers must “get out of their cars” to overcome deep mistrust between minority communities and officers. During the address, Comey also called for better federal data collection, admitting that he couldn’t say with certainty how many Americans are shot by police each year.A federal investigation into Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Wilson is ongoing but news reports indicate the case will result in no prosecution . The Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Garner’s death at the hands of white police officer Daniel Pantaleo.As Agnew, the Florida activist, said: “This country is not ready to acknowledge that George Zimmerman may have murdered Trayvon Martin and that this country made it possible.”Topics	2015/02/27	factcheck

Because of the political push to make sure that guns are blamed for the problems, the Second Amendment has been under attack.That attack has caused conservatives everywhere to stand up for their rights to bear arms and protect themselves from tyranny in every form. In some cases that stand is taken in town hall-style meetings or calls and letters to representatives. And just like everything else in our lives today, much of it is done on social media.Sadly, for some social media users, this is getting them a big backlash. Not only are some accounts or posts being taken down by the private companies that own social media accounts, but the FBI is even investigating those who they consider might be a threat. While it’s certainly the FBI’s job to look into possible threats, the current political climate seems to be pointing to any proud gun owner as a possible threat. The True Pundit reports about one strong conservative voice that got a visit from his local sheriff in the wake of his social media post that went viral:“It appears Twitter and the FBI are working together — not to stop Conservatives from being harassed — but to harass Conservatives.Just ask Brenden Dilley, a recent GOP Congressional candidate in Arizona and outspoken journalist who has criticized corruption in the FBI.Dilley was sacked on Twitter days ago, losing 135,000 followers because he Tweeted and defended the Second Amendment, in addition to frequent negative critiques about the FBI in recent months.Today, the FBI came knocking.”EMERGENCYTHE FBI JUST SENT OUT THE LOCAL SHERIFF TO SEE IF I WAS A THREAT BASED ON MY 2ND AMENDMENT TWEET. https://t.co/pKr7jKChWl #FBI #2ndAmendment #TheStorm #QAnon— Brenden M Dilley (@TheRealHublife) April 3, 2018Too bad they didn’t send someone to Nicholas Cruz’s house after one of the two credible threats he made were reported to them at the FBI.— Burnt Peacock (@Burntpeacock) April 3, 2018This technique isn’t a new one. In fact, it’s something that the FBI and local law enforcement have been doing for years now. As early as 2012, CNN reported that law enforcement was beginning to use the wide world of social media to get information on possible suspects:“Police look at what information is public and sometimes create fake online identities to befriend suspects and view their private information. Authorities also can request private data directly from social networks with subpoenas or warrants, or make an emergency request for user information if they think there’s an imminent threat of danger.These techniques are slowly catching on across the country. According to a recent survey of 1,221 federal, state and local law enforcement who use social media, four out of five officials used social media to gather intelligence during investigations.Half said they checked social media at least once a week, and the majority said social media helps them solve crimes faster. The online survey was conducted by LexisNexis Risk Solutions and had a 2.8% margin of error.The survey found that Facebook is the most fruitful social network for law enforcement, followed by YouTube.Some ‘public’ information takes a bit of maneuvering to find. Someone can have their Facebook settings as private as possible, but their friends or relatives might not be as savvy, allowing police to collect information by looking at what a suspect posts on their friends’ public pages. Drug dealers have been known to post innocuous public updates that include location information so clients — and unwittingly, law enforcement — know where to find them, police said.Police even have been using Facebook as a way to help victims identify suspects.Going undercover on FacebookA more controversial approach to getting information from social networks is going undercover online — creating fake profiles to befriend suspects.‘We do have some covert accounts for targeted enforcements,’ said Cincinnati’s Gerard.Facebook, where almost 9% of accounts are believed to be fakes or duplicates, frowns on this practice, however.‘It just undermines the integrity of our whole service if we allow people to use false accounts,’ said Joe Sullivan, Facebook’s chief security officer, in an interview with CNN last month. Creating a fake profile is against Facebook’s terms of service, even for law enforcement. Sullivan said there is no context in which Facebook allows fake identities, and that it has a ‘large commitment’ to finding and disabling false accounts.While these fake accounts may violate a social network’s rules, they are not illegal. And evidence collected in this way can still hold up in court.‘In other, nondigital circumstances, these types of practices have been upheld,’ said Hanni Fakhoury, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet civil-liberties organization, in an email. ‘For example, the police oftentimes pose as young girls to capture people for soliciting a minor to engage in sexual activities. Or they pose as a potential drug buyer in order to arrest individuals on drug crimes.'”The problem with social media posts being censored is one issue, but it’s a business problem because the companies are privately owned. The problem of police considering legal gun owners to be a threat, however, is a far more disturbing issue. The government will always try to overreach because it’s the nature of the beast. It’s up to their bosses (that’s the voters) to keep them in check.	2018/04/01	factcheck

Bennett did not single out law enforcement or any particular group as someone or something he disagreed with but instead said Americans need to try and bridge prejudices and stop acts of hatred.""I hope that I can activate everybody to get off their hands and feet and go out into the communities and push helping each other,"" he told reporters after Sunday's game. ""Sit down with somebody that's the opposite sex, sit down with somebody that's the opposite race, different religion and understand that people are different and go out and join the community and try to change the society, change what you're a part of. If you don't like it, keep changing it.""The racial protests Saturday in Charlottesville, Va., which led to death and injuries, helped foster his decision to sit for the anthem, Bennett said. Yet, this move was clearly not a knee-jerk reaction.""Charlottesville had a lot to do with it but I think it's just the journey of who I am as a person. I think everybody has a time where they feel like they need to be who they are and stand up for what they believe in,"" Bennett explained.Bennett has spoken on racial, religious and other political issues for more than a year. He also has held camps, given time and money and supported some of the causes which he has addressed.Those actions didn't drive enough attention, which is why Bennett said that he decided to not stand for the playing of the national anthem before games -- a gesture that has evoked emotions, supportive and not.Bennett and several of his Seahawks teammates addressed racial turmoil and other issues throughout last season. Players typically locked arms in solidarity before games during the national anthem, something many did Sunday.Kaepernick's decision to not stand for the national anthem before a preseason game last season drew ire and praise but also made him a lightning rod for controversy, which still resounds loudly. Kaepernick has drawn the wrath of politicians, some military, supporters of the armed forces and in particular members of law enforcement -- the main target of his protest.Kaepernick remains unemployed, in part because of the stance he took -- a stance that has made him one of the most recognizable athletes in our era. The Seahawks are the only team to bring Kaepernick in for a face-to-face interview this summer but they opted not to sign him.Bennett said he has nothing against the military and that his stance is to encourage bridge building, not further separation or hate. He said he expects negative backlash but that he feels he must stand up for his beliefs by not standing for the anthem.""Of course I'm going to face backlash. This is bigger than me. This is bigger than football. This is bigger than anything that we have any different. This is about people. This is about bringing opportunities to people, giving people equality. This is bigger than a sport,"" said Bennett.Coach Pete Carroll said he did not see Bennett sit and he did not know that he would. Bennett said he did not discuss his plan with anyone because he doesn't want to bring someone into a potential cauldron of controversy. Based on what happened with Kaepernick, that likely will be unavoidable.Bennett said he did not speak to his former teammate, Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch , who did not stand for the playing of the national anthem during Saturday's loss against the Cardinals . Several Seahawks players did not know if Lynch's gesture was any type of protest. Some added that he usually did not stand or wasn't on the field during the national anthem when he played for the team.Seahawks officials said it was never brought to their attention when Lynch didn't stand for the national anthem that it was any type of protest."	2017/08/14	factcheck
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/no-treason-or-bust-for-obama/	No ‘Treason’ or ‘Bust’ for Obama	false	['National', 'false stories', 'Barack Obama']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/he-threatened-to-kill-the-president-now-he-is-seeking-public-office/2017/03/08/ec31f768-0381-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.8f1f22fc1ada	2018/06/07	When accountant Nathan D. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to threatening to kill the U.S. president, an admission that led to 16 months in federal prison and three years of supervised release. Since then, among other things, he has advocated for legalizing incestuous marriage and making it harder to win a court restraining order against an allegedly abusive spouse. “If [voters] had asked about it, I would have told them,” said Larson, who describes himself as a libertarian, although party leaders say they have disavowed him. He hopes to run as an independent to replace Republican L. Scott Lingamfelter (R-Prince William) in Virginia’s 31st District, which includes portions of Fauquier and Prince William counties. He has submitted more than the required 125 signatures and has until June 3, the day of the primaries, to file candidacy papers. Larson’s criminal record precluded him from running for office until last year, when Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) restored voting and other civil rights to thousands of convicted felons across the state. The executive action drew outrage and a successful court challenge from Republicans, but McAuliffe found a way to proceed with rights restoration on a more limited basis. Now, it is propelling Larson’s otherwise quixotic bid for public office into Virginia’s heated governor’s race. “This is the problem when you have a blanket restoration of rights like this,” Ed Gillespie, the leading Republican gubernatorial contender, says in a video posted to his Facebook page in which he criticizes his Democratic opponents for their support of McAuliffe’s order. “I would like to know why Congressman Tom Perriello and Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam think it’s a good idea for people like Nathan Larson and for those who are the most violent felons in the commonwealth should not only have their rights restored and be able to vote but also to be able to run for office and put them on a path to be able to obtain a weapon,” Gillespie says. Northam spokesman David Turner said in a statement that the Democrat “finds Nathan Larson’s threats, beliefs and behavior abhorrent” and considers him unfit for public office. “However, Ed Gillespie’s attempts to attack important steps forward in criminal justice reform to score political points underscores how he is stuck in the D.C. swamp,” Turner said. Larson, 36, says his candidacy is rooted in a genuine desire to bring positive changes to Virginia. He called a letter he sent to the Secret Service in 2008 that warned of his imminent plans to assassinate either President George W. Bush or President Barack Obama an act of civil disobedience meant to call attention to what he believes is the tyranny of the U.S. government. “It doesn’t allow people to secede or do anything like that,” Larson said. His platform includes legalizing child pornography as well as incestuous marriage; allowing men to have multiple wives and physically discipline them; repealing the 19th Amendment; and abolishing state funding for girls and women to attend high school and college. Larson also wants to strengthen fathers’ rights in child-custody cases and make it tougher to win a court restraining order against a spouse — positions that he said are inspired by personal experience. In 2015, after he returned to Virginia from Colorado, his then-wife was granted a court restraining order against him shortly after they were officially divorced. He later learned she was pregnant with their daughter. The daughter’s mother committed suicide after the baby was born, Larson said, and the girl is being raised by relatives in Colorado. He has met the child only once and has since remarried, he said. Larson has been convicted of several misdemeanors, including a 2003 charge in Fairfax County for “use of computer for harassment” and two earlier convictions for marijuana possession, court records show. And he argues that his experience with police and courts gives him a leg up on Lingamfelter and the two Democratic candidates for the delegate’s seat, Sara Townsend and Elizabeth Guzman. “If you’ve been through the system, you’ve seen it from that perspective, and you know more about how the justice system works,” he said. Manassas resident Jane Lakeman, the first voter to sign Larson’s petition for candidacy, was taken aback when she learned Wednesday that she had supported the political ambitions of someone who had threatened to kill a U.S. president. “I’m a little bit uncomfortable that he was at my door,” Lakeman said. Lakeman, a Democrat, said Larson described himself as a Libertarian who wanted to present voters in Virginia with more options, an idea she supported. “It was a very short conversation,” she said. “He seemed okay.	2017/03/08	factcheck

Immigration to America is a privilege, not a right. If you want to come and stay, you must contribute.President Trump’s administration will be looking to roll out more restrictions on immigrants planning to enter the U.S., as well as those already in the country. The administration would be seeking to “deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge” and develop standards for “determining” whether an immigrant can be deported after five years, if that person receives a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid.The second order, titled “ Executive Order on Protecting American Jobs and Workers by Strengthening the Integrity of Foreign Worker Visa Programs” calls for eliminating the jobs magnet that is driving illegal immigration to the United States. The order would rescind any work visa provisions for foreign nationals found not to be in “the national interest” or in violation of U.S. immigration laws.Illegal Immigrants living in sanctuary cities can apply for and get, public assistance without fear of deportation. Their illegal status is kept confidential. They come and go at will.The term “sanctuary city” is a generalized description where city funds are not used to implement federal immigration laws. These cities have decided by legal regulation not to inquire about the immigration status of the people in which they come in contact. In other words, it’s another form of “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Sanctuary cities continue to be a festering public-safety concern throughout the country. ICE has identified about 300 cities that are uncooperative and obstruct immigration enforcement. There are four whole states, California, Connecticut, New Mexico, and Colorado that have declared as sanctuary states.A detainer is the primary tool used by ICE to gain custody of illegals for deportation. It’s a notice to other law enforcement agencies that ICE intends to take custody of the alien. It also includes information on the alien’s criminal history, immigration violations and potential threat to public safety. While many Americans, even veterans, struggle with getting adequate medical care, not so with the illegals. Medical care provided to illegal immigrants is costly for New York City’s legal residents. A 2002 report by the United States General Accounting Office, in-patient care in hospitals provided to illegal immigrants cost the state $474 million. However, this figure fails to include the out-patient costs associated with treating the illegal immigrant population in emergency rooms. When these figures are included, the overall taxpayer-funded, non-reimbursed medical outlays for health care provided to the state’s illegal immigrant population amount to an estimated $690 million a year.Almost half the households headed by an illegal immigrant are receiving welfare, food assistance and health benefits for their children. In total, the illegal immigrant population residing in New York costs the state’s taxpayers more than $5 billion per year for education, medical care and incarceration costs. On a per person basis, the annual tax burden amounts to about $874 per New York household headed by a native-born resident. That’s just for New York! Sanctuary city status has really paid off for them. Multiply New York’s cost of public assistance for illegals by 300, the number of sanctuary cities, and a clearer picture is shown. We can’t continue this way.In Your Neighborhood?This flies in the face of globalism and open borders. Just look how that’s worked out for Europe. Angela Merkel and European Union leaders are reeling from the defeats they’re facing from their open borders policies. Their globalist agenda is being challenged by the voters in their respective countries. The United Nations won’t give up on it and plans to push for the New World Order.Brexit is an abbreviation for “British exit,” which refers to the June 23, 2016, referendum whereby British citizens voted to exit the European Union. With an austerity program in place and its economy barely out of recession, Britain is one of several European countries whose voters appear disenchanted with mainstream politicians and worried about social and economic issues, including immigration. The proposed changes would make it easier to deport foreigners who commit serious crimes, increase fines on companies that use illegal labor and force private landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants. Temporary immigrants would also be required to pay for some of their health care.On immigration, the government said its new measures would seek to stop immigrants from using public services to which they are not entitled, make it harder to appeal deportation orders, regulate access to health care for immigrants, and prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining driver’s licenses.I Love My Food Stamps!The conditions that exist today in Germany are like what they were in the 1920’s in respect to immigration. Now as then, it could lead to extreme elements coming forth to apply their version of nationalism. We’ve learned through history that’s a dangerous place for Germany to be. It’s a dangerous place for our country to be.Germany has been under siege from a flood of refugees from Syria. The backlash from the far-right has been intense. Copies of Mein Kampf have been flying off the shelves.“Besides naturalization that is acquired through the fact of having been born within the confines of a State there exists another kind of naturalization which can be acquired later. This process is subject to various preliminary requirements. “One condition is that, if possible, the applicant must not be a burglar or a common street thug. It is required that he shall not be a burden to the State of which he wishes to become a citizen. In this realistic epoch of ours this last condition naturally only means that he must not be a financial burden. If the affairs of the candidate are such that it appears likely he will turn out to be a good taxpayer, that is a very important consideration and will help him to obtain civic rights more rapidly.” —- Adolf Hitler Extremism leads to extremism. We have some challenging times ahead as we take back control of our country. Thankfully, we have the strong leadership of Donald Trump to get us there. We’re going to need it.	2017/01/31	factcheck

Trump welcomed four families adversely affected by Obamacare to the White House for a listening session. These victims of Obamacare shared stories of skyrocketing premiums, denied access, restrictions, and low reimbursement rates due to Obamacare’s failing infrastructure.President Trump Gives a Statement on HealthcarePresident Trump Gives a Statement on HealthcareAmong the group visiting the White House was the Ackison family from Marysville, Ohio. Melissa Ackinson was denied coverage after her eight-week old child was mistakenly omitted from their insurance plan. Melissa was concerned by the lack of coverage for her infant as her other son had recently returned from hospitalization due to an unnamed infectious disease. While Melissa had the opportunity to pay for the immunizations out-of-pocket, she could not afford the high cost of premiums and even higher deductibles on her marketplace plan.The Finn family from Morgantown, West Virginia, decided to try Obamacare to cover employees in their family business, but suffered the effects of a 200% rate increase on deductibles after the first year, leaving them unable to provide healthcare coverage to those working for the company.download-full-size-imageMembers of the Weer family from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina voiced concerns over the stability of the current healthcare system. Their three-year-old son Monty was diagnosed with Spina Bifida. Since his birth, he has been with two different insurance companies and healthcare plans which has made continuity difficult. Because Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only insurance company available in their area, the family is continually negotiating with clinics or traveling outside of the state.The Witzig family from Washington, Illinois, also attended the listening session. Erin and Andy Witzig own a small business, and desire to have the best coverage possible for their six children. Their youngest daughter Poppy has a rare genetic condition, Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB). This requires her to be in bandages from neck-to-toe every day. These specialty bandages are used by burn victims and are extremely costly. Every year since the implementation of Obamacare, their private insurance plan for Poppy has been discontinued and replaced with a new, supposedly equivalent, policy that is always more expensive and has far less benefits.download-full-size-imagePresident Trump and Vice President Pence met with the healthcare victims and their families, ensuring that the Administration was committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The President then gave remarks, reaffirming his mission to find a healthcare solution that will better serve the American people.“To every member of the Senate, I say this: The American people have waited long enough. There’s been enough talk and no action. Now is the time for action. We are here to solve problems for the people. Obamacare has broken our healthcare system — it’s broken, it’s collapsing, it’s gone. And now it is up to us to get great healthcare for the American people. We must repeal and replace Obamacare now,” President Trump stated.The White House	2017/07/24	factcheck

It faces some daunting challenges: a drop in fund-raising during the campaign; uncertainty about the scale of the former president’s ambitions; and questions about leadership, including how long its president, Donna E. Shalala, will stay, and whether Mrs. Clinton might rejoin the charity.Mr. Clinton, in a letter to be released with the foundation’s annual report this week, went so far as to ask supporters for advice on its future. “We seek both your input and your ideas,” he wrote, noting that the organization would work to expand its impact.Ms. Shalala, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledged the difficulties. “Last year was a tough year,” she said, “because people were beating on us with nonsense,” a reference to bruising political attacks claiming that donors were using the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons.Image“Last year was a tough year,” said Donna E. Shalala, president of the Clinton Foundation, whose tenure is in question.CreditRodrigo Varela/Getty ImagesRevenues were down for 2016, Ms. Shalala acknowledged, in part because of voluntary restrictions and the fact that the charity’s major fund-raisers — the former president and his daughter, Chelsea — were campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. Revenues “dropped during the economic downturn, too,” Ms. Shalala said.Still, both Mr. Clinton and Ms. Shalala, who also cited concerns in keeping talent, expressed optimism. “At the end of the day,” she said, “I think this is going to be as it always was: a creative, dynamic foundation that helps to improve the lives of millions.”As the foundation looks within, many experts said it was right to assess its future, including whether a great enough need still existed for its most prominent asset: the ability to bring the private sector together with charities to help underserved causes.“It’s certainly a different landscape than it was” when the foundation’s work began, said Carolyn Miles, president and chief executive of Save the Children, one of the foundation’s early partners. “I would say you have to come back as something slightly different.”In recent weeks, the foundation has completed a planned shutdown of the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosted a high-profile annual meeting, and laying off most of the initiative’s staff of about 100. Foundation officials confirmed on Thursday that two major programs, including one in Haiti, would transfer out of the foundation.ImageMr. Clinton greeting children at a hospital in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic in 2007.CreditWin McNamee/Getty Images for the Clinton FoundationThe organization has also considered scaling back other efforts, according to several people familiar with the discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Staff members have prepared options for Bill and Chelsea Clinton to consider, which include some new endeavors, Ms. Shalala said.Meanwhile, foundation officials are striving to project an image of business as usual. The new annual report highlighted the organization’s efforts across the world, including opening a health clinic in Malawi and expanding its role in countering the opioid crisis in the United States. During the holidays, Mr. Clinton reached out to donors offering to match year-end contributions. Chelsea Clinton and foundation staff members in January packed grapefruits at a community service event in New York with City Harvest. And Ms. Shalala announced a new partnership to enhance the health of children in San Diego County.President Trump’s executive order banning federal assistance for international health groups if they counsel women on or provide abortions has also contributed to fears of a broader decline in funding for global health work. Ms. Shalala said she had discussed how to contend with that possibility in a recent conversation with Bill Gates, whose charity has supported the Clinton Foundation and many other nonprofits.The foundation was formed in 1997 during Mr. Clinton’s presidency and has raised roughly $2 billion since then. Its work has spanned 3,500 projects and 180 countries including the United States, with projects as varied as earthquake recovery in Haiti and health initiatives in Rwanda .During the presidential campaign, political opponents pounded the foundation, criticizing its dealings with foreign donors and financiers. No evidence emerged of a quid pro quo while Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, but the overlapping interests of foreign donors to the foundation and official international affairs dogged her candidacy.ImageMrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, and Melinda Gates at the inauguration of a global partnership on maternal and child health in 2011.CreditCliff Owen/Associated PressThe philanthropy was a focus for Mrs. Clinton after her time as secretary of state and before her recent presidential run. In terms of deciding whether to re-engage, “we are not there yet even remotely now,” Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said.Ms. Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under Mr. Clinton and seemed destined for a White House role if Mrs. Clinton had prevailed, said it was unclear how long she would stay as the foundation’s president. For the moment, hiring appears muted: Most of the job postings on the foundation’s website are for food service and catering jobs at the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Ark.Many believe the foundation’s future will depend on Mr. Clinton, now 70, always its driving force. “Does he still have the energy, passion, desire and the good health in order to devote energy to it?” Neal Keny-Guyer, the chief executive of the global humanitarian organization Mercy Corps, asked during a phone interview from Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum in January.On Thursday, Ms. Shalala described the former president and Chelsea Clinton, who both serve on the foundation’s board, as engaged, “main influences” on decision-making, with Mr. Clinton still a draw for donors. “He’s got a lot of friends,” Ms. Shalala said.But others saw obstacles ahead.“The big issue they are going to face is to what degree can they raise money now that the Clintons seem to be out of national leadership positions,” said Leslie Lenkowsky, a philanthropy expert at Indiana University. “They have lost a little bit of their luster.”ImageChelsea Clinton helping volunteers prepare free medical kits for distribution around the world in 2015. The foundation is scaling back some efforts and seeking advice on its future.CreditBrennan Linsley/Associated PressIn 2015, the charity’s revenues were nearly $300 million, down from $338 million in 2014, according to its annual report. It has not yet released figures for 2016, but Ms. Shalala acknowledged that they were lower. Internal goals of raising $20 million in unrestricted funds in 2016 were surpassed, but “took a lot of effort to get there,” she said.In August, at the official start of the general election campaign, the foundation announced its decision to shutter the Clinton Global Initiative, a yearly gathering that Douglas J. Band, a longtime aide of Mr. Clinton’s, had conceived of as a way to connect wealthy donors and corporations with worthy causes. It held its final meeting in September.By contrast, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, known as CHAI — a separate but affiliated entity — halted a series of moves designed to disengage from the Clintons in the event that Mrs. Clinton won the White House.Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for CHAI, said the group’s work was continuing amid discussions about its future.“None of it’s resolved,” said Dr. Paul Farmer, a board member of CHAI, which has health programs in 70 countries that include promoting AIDS treatment and strengthening health systems, in a telephone interview from Haiti. “Knowing what to do in this climate is a tough call.”ImageMorning rounds in 2015 at University Central Hospital of Kigali, Rwanda, where the Human Resources for Health Program was part of the Clinton Health Access Initiative.CreditMartina Bacigalupo for The New York TimesAcross the worldwide outposts where the Clinton Foundation has a presence, speculation about its future has been rampant. In some foreign countries, CHAI has been accused of using the Clintons’ influence to pressure governments into pursuing certain initiatives, or rewarding favored American development partners.“If they disappear it would be very ironic,” said Dr. Patricia A. McQuilkin, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.Speaking from Liberia, she said CHAI’s initiatives in the wake of the Ebola epidemic had sidelined longtime academic partnerships like hers. “They insinuate themselves into the whole process and try to take it over,” she said.Development experts, including Daniel F. Runde, a former director of the Office of Global Development Alliances at the United States Agency for International Development, generally expressed the belief that the foundation could continue to attract support for its work.“It’s a damaged brand,” Mr. Runde said, “but there remains an international demand for them.”For years, the Clinton Foundation has worked with organizations founded by other former presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to George W. Bush. In recent months, Ms. Shalala said, foundation officials have offered advice for former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, on their own foundation, which will focus on national and international community building programs. “They called and asked some questions,” Ms. Shalala said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: Uncertainty at Clinton Foundation in Trump Era.

Photograph: Adam Gabbatt for the GuardianA motorcycle group’s plan to “raise awareness” of the threat of homegrown jihad by riding to an all-Muslim New York town backfired on Sunday, when only five motorcyclists showed up. Hundreds of people, meanwhile, flocked to the town to show their support for its residents.Islamville, South Carolina's all-Muslim town, faces Trump effect: 'We feel unsafe'Read moreAmerican Bikers United Against Jihad spent months calling for people to take part in the event, which organizers described as a “ride for national security” and promised would see “hundreds” of bikers riding past Islamberg, in upstate New York .But the five riders who showed up found themselves completely overshadowed when more than 400 people travelled to Islamberg – some driving for hours to get there – to take part in a “peace rally and community day”.As the motorcyclists rode past the town, about three hours north-west of New York City, residents and supporters stood along the street. Some waved American flags, some called out “Welcome!” Others chanted: “Freedom, justice, USA!”“I don’t know what they’re riding against,” said Islamberg mayor Rashid Clark. “My only concern is for our safety. It doesn’t provoke me.”After witnessing the ride-by, the supporters – who included people from Christian churches and other faiths – were welcomed into the town. Residents laid on food, music and speeches from community leaders.“We just decided, ‘OK, if you want to ride by we’re going to hold a peace rally,’” said Clark, 46. “And that idea came from the fact that all these community members, all these people you see here, they also found [details of the rally] online and they called us, and said they wanted to come and support. This turnout is not our doing.”The majority of Islamberg residents are African Americans. The town was established by The Muslims of America in 1984, and is home to around 25 families. The organization has established more than a dozen towns across the US, with Islamberg serving as its headquarters.A series of online conspiracy theories have given rise to the idea that Muslims of America towns are home to jihad training camps. The notion has been repeatedly debunked by law enforcement officials, but this has not deterred extremists.In April 2015, a man named Robert Doggart pleaded guilty to planning to attack Islamberg . He faces trial this summer. In November 2015, the FBI issued a warning to New York police after Jon Ritzheimer, a man later involved in the occupation of the Malheur wildlife refuge in Oregon , posted a video online saying he planned to drive to Islamberg and confront residents.American Bikers United Against Jihad planned to set off for Islamberg at noon. Ram Lubranicki, the main organiser, described the ride as an “educational” event designed to draw attention to “jihad camps” in the town.PinterestMayor Rashid Clark of Islamberg, New York. Photograph: Adam Gabbatt for the GuardianLubranicki, from New Jersey, called for bikers to congregate in a parking lot in Deposit, around seven miles from Islamberg. At 11.45am, there were three bikers present.“So far it’s a little disappointing,” Lubranicki said. “If we had great weather we could easily have a few hundred bikers here.”Lubranicki was upbeat.“There’s certainly a lot of excitement about this idea,” he said. “We’re in the process of developing a website.”Lubranicki was not riding a motorcycle. He said he was conscious he would be required to talk to the press – there were two journalists present – and there would be a lot of organizing to do.Lubranicki had travelled from New Jersey in a champagne-colored Hyundai Sonata. As he waited for bikers to arrive, he draped a banner over the rear of the car. It bore the logo of the American Bikers United Against Jihad: a skull draped in the American flag with a sword alongside.Beneath the banner there was a bottle, functioning as a collections jar. It contained $23.A fourth motorcyclist – a man named Hal, who was wearing a skull cap and a black leather vest with a large Grateful Dead patch on the back – arrived at 11.55am. Another turned up at 12.05.The riders delayed the start for an hour, in case any attendees were late arriving. None were.The group drew out of the parking lot at 1pm, the five bikers following Lubranicki’s Sonata. Three other cars were present, bringing the number of ride against jihad attendees to 12 people and one dog.State troopers were posted along the route to Islamberg, but the ride passed without event. The riders finished their tour at a parking lot beyond the town, before going their separate ways.Back at Islamberg, hundreds were enjoying food prepared by the town’s residents. A large tent had been erected: attendees chatted as they dined on chicken, pasta, potato salad and salad.Josie Hovis, 15, had heard about the peace rally through her church, Cooperstown First Presbyterian, and had travelled the two hours with her parents and brother.“You hear a lot of nasty information in the news, especially in this presidential campaign, and it makes you sad and depressed about the state of things in the world,” she said.“But most of the time people don’t really do anything about it. And this was an opportunity to really take action about the bigotry we see today.”Dr Bilqees Abdullah, who declined to give her age but described herself as “seasoned”, has lived in Islamberg for around 30 years. She works in a local hospital as well as providing care for the elderly in the town.“It was very, very heartwarming,” she said of the peace rally. “To see so many people come and join and actually say: ‘This isn’t right, this isn’t fair, and we’re not going for it,’ it’s wonderful. Very wonderful.”Topics	2016/05/16	factcheck

Following strong bipartisan criticism of the administration’s decision to allow imports of trophy carcasses, a practice that was halted under the Obama administration, Trump moved Friday to put the imports on hold. On Sunday, Trump said on Twitter that he would announce a final decision this week. He suggested that he does not buy the argument advanced by pro-hunting advocates within his Interior Department that the imports help protect endangered African elephants. Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.— Donald J. Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal. It was not immediately clear whether the reference to “any other animal” might mean he is also reconsidering his administration’s separate lifting of import bans on lion trophies last month. That decision received little attention at the time but has since come under fire as the elephant decision received wide attention. The president’s abrupt reversal Friday means that elephants shot for sport in Zimbabwe and Zambia cannot be imported by American hunters as trophies. “Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,” Trump wrote Friday evening on Twitter. “Under study for years. Will update soon with [Interior] Secretary [Ryan] Zinke. That halted a decision by his own U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday to end a 2014 government ban on big-game trophy hunting in Zimbabwe and Zambia. Under U.S. law, the remains of African elephants, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, can be imported only if federal officials have determined that hunting them benefits the species more broadly.	2017/11/19	factcheck

Sloan Foundation, Democracy Fund, Omidyar Network, Arnold Foundation, and Facebook in supporting independent scholarship that addresses the urgent and profound questions regarding technologys role in civic discourse, the open exchange of ideas, and other hallmarks of a liberal democracy, here and around the world, said Koch Foundation president Brian Hooks. These questions, like others addressing some of the most pressing issues of our day, will benefit from open inquiry and academic exploration.This massive research operation is not specifically named in Zuckerbergs prepared remarks to Congress in his testimony but is a part of his broader topic of how to improve Facebook security in light of Cambridge Analytica and Russia abusing the platform.Mark Zuckerberg will be answering questions before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees and on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose names and office phone numbers are linked above. The committees are likely to ask questions about the safety measures being put in place to prevent this new wave of data from finding political use. Until Congress clarifies the issue, it seems we just have to trust the Koch Brothers with our data.Zuckerberg did not answer Grit Posts calls to his cellphone, nor to text messages requesting comment.

Couric, hired with great fanfare in 2013 by then-Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, will continue to work with Oath — the new Verizon division that consolidates AOL and Yahoo — on a project basis. Some of the Yahoo shows she was a part of, such as “Cities Rising” and “Now I Get It,” will continue on Yahoo News. “Over the last four years, Katie has created a vast portfolio of work that has been equal parts inspiring, thought-provoking and fun to watch,” an Oath rep said in an emailed statement. The news that Couric was leaving Yahoo was first reported by Recode’s Kara Swisher. According to the report, Couric’s contract expired in March and was renewed through June, whereupon she decided to shift to a project-based relationship with Oath. When Couric re-upped with Yahoo in 2015, she reportedly received $10 million per year in cash and stock, up from $6 million when she first signed in 2013. Mayer’s big bet on hiring of Couric was supposed to jump-start Yahoo’s bigger foray into video, which included the company picking up and funding several bigger-budget original series. But the strategy never gained traction, and Mayer pulled the plug on the video effort to focus on bulking up Yahoo’s search business. Couric previously had a long career in TV, having anchored the CBS Evening News and NBC’s “Today.” Her jump to Yahoo was viewed by some observers as a reflection of the growing importance of internet video in the media landscape. But Couric never seemed to break back into the zeitgeist while at Yahoo News, where she interviewed newsmakers and celebs ranging from Edward Snowden to Sen. Lindsey Graham and from Gal Gadot to Sherry Lansing. While at Yahoo, Couric remained a special contributor to ABC News. With Verizon’s closing of the Yahoo acquisition last month, Mayer — as expected — left the company. Oath is run by Tim Armstrong, formerly CEO of AOL.	2017/07/28	factcheck

He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.Most Popular >>	2017/03/16	factcheck

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/horner-hoax-remix/	Horner Hoax Remix	false	['National', 'falsehoods', 'Hoaxes', 'Paul Horner']	http://www.idahostatesman.com/	http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/state/idaho/article84829787.html	2018/02/16	Authorities are denying reports that Syrians gang-raped a child at knife-point in a Twin Falls apartment complex earlier this month, saying the false claims are being spread to incite anti-refugee sentiments. “There were no Syrians involved, there was no knife involved, there was no gang-rape,” Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said Monday morning. His comments largely refute several differing accounts about the incident circulating on anti-refugee resettlement and conspiracy websites and anti-Muslim blogs. Most of those accounts claim a group of Syrian refugees sexually assaulted a mentally disabled girl at knife-point June 2 in the laundry facilities of Fawnbrook Apartments, a low-income housing complex in Twin Falls, and that the attack was celebrated by the perpetrators’ families as city officials orchestrated a cover-up. Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. Investigators and the prosecutor were quick to dismiss nearly all those claims Monday. Loebs said he didn’t want to “fan the flames of anti-Syrian refugee people” but suspects the false reports are the work of a local group opposed to refugee resettlement who hoped to stir up trouble by claiming the incident involved Syrian refugees who committed a violent sexual assault. “There is a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees, and thus far they have not been constrained by the truth,” Loebs said. An incident did occur, Loebs said, and two juveniles have been charged after authorities obtained video shot on a cellphone. But the details of the case don’t match what’s being reported by anti-refugee groups, the prosecutor said. The criminal cases against those juveniles have been sealed, as is customary when children are charged. Although prosecutors and police are barred from discussing certain details in sealed juvenile cases, Loebs laid out the basics in an interview Monday with the Times-News. And Twin Falls Police Chief Craig Kingsbury briefed the public on the incident at a City Council meeting later in the evening, saying he wanted to clear up falsehoods circulating on social media. According to those officials, three boys were involved, ages 7, 10 and 14, and the alleged victim was a 5-year-old girl. The boys are from Sudan and Iraq; none are Syrian. They are being held at a juvenile detention facility. Officials suspect the boys have been in the Uniteds States fewer than two years, but their refugee status wasn’t immediately clear to the police chief. There were no adults involved, Loebs said, the boys didn’t have a knife, and the incident wasn’t a “gang-rape” instigated by the oldest boy. “All those involved are juveniles, and the older one didn’t touch the victim in any way,” Loebs said. Only one person is alleged to have touched the victim, said the prosecutor, though he declined to elaborate. The police chief also said there is no evidence to support claims the suspects’ fathers high-fived or praised the boys for committing the alleged assault, as has been reported on anti-refugee websites. The prosecutor received a report Thursday from police. Further refuting claims made in the stories online that police bungled the investigation or tried to cover it up, Loebs said the police investigated the incident thoroughly, interviewed everyone who needed to be and followed proper protocols. The police chief told the public the victim’s health and safety were the department’s first priority, and apprehending the suspects was the second — regardless of either’s ethnicity or religious beliefs. Kingsbury also addressed claims that it took the police department more than two hours to respond. “Simply, that just is not true,” the chief said. Loebs said sex cases between minors aren’t uncommon and implied that this case is being exploited by the local anti-refugee movement to make a political point. Refugee-resettlement officials called the online reports deceptive attempts to incite anti-refugee sentiments. Only a handful of people from Syria live in Twin Falls County — 11 Syrians were receiving food stamps in the county and eight were on Medicaid in 2015, according to state statistics. No Syrians have been settled in Twin Falls through Idaho refugee programs, said Jan Reeves, director of the Idaho Office for Refugees. “There have been periodic website postings about hundreds of Syrians coming to Idaho that have all proven to be false in the past, and this is probably just one of those attempts to try and stir up hatred and bigotry,” he said. Zeze Rwasama, director of the CSI Refugee Center, said he knows no details about the incident or the names of those involved but is deeply concerned about what the online claims and misinformation are doing to the community. “I think the community has seen a lot of negativity around the refugee programs,” Rwasama said. Echoing statements by the prosecutor, Rwasama said refugee opponents are trying to promote an agenda, particularly against Syrian refugees. He asked residents to confirm facts and refrain from speculating online. “It breaks my heart when people in the community are divided around issues of resettling refugees,” he said. Last week, residents at a City Council meeting called on city officials to release more information about the incident and questioned whether authorities were covering it up. The story blew up over the weekend when the juveniles were arrested, and differing accounts were widely circulated on conspiracy-oriented blogs such as Dr. Rich Swier, Refugee Resettlement Watch, Creeping Sharia and Info Wars. People packed the Council's meeting on Monday, some speaking in favor of refugee resettlement and others warning that resettlement was a federal government plot overseen by President Barack Obama to allow Muslims to infiltrate the United States. Supporters of the family started a Facebook group, “Justice For Our Children,” that had almost 9,000 members as of Mondaymorning. They have also started a GoFundMe page to raise money to help the family move and an online petition that had more than 1,100 signatures from all over the country as of Monday. The incident is just the latest to rekindle a debate in Twin Falls over refugees, security, culture and religion. News last year that Syrians fleeing a years-long civil war could be among about 300 refugees to be resettled in Twin Falls this year touched off an anti-refugee movement that sought to close the local resettlement office. Those efforts failed when organizers couldn’t gather enough signatures to put the measure before voters. Critics of the program have raised concerns about security and refugee vetting, but some of the movement’s most prominent members have also pitched wild conspiracy theories and tried to frame the debate around religion by frequently making disparaging remarks against Muslims. Though no Syrians refugees have been resettled in Twin Falls, 36 have been resettled in Boise. “These were all families,” said Reeves, the director of the Idaho Office for Refugees. “They’re now resettled here. Aside from denying false rumors that are swirling around the Internet, prosecutors and police are saying very little about an alleged sexual assault by three juveniles that occurred June 2 at the Fawnbrook Apartments in Twin Falls. In that way, this case is just like any other of its nature. Police and prosecutors treat sexual assault cases very carefully no matter what the age of the victims or alleged perpetrators, and when only juveniles are involved, the cases are often kept completely sealed. On its website, the Idaho Supreme Court explains that juveniles charged with a crime first appear in court for an “admit or deny hearing,” which is similar to an adult arraignment. “At this hearing the court shall also determine the confidentiality status of juvenile case records and proceedings,” the Supreme Court says. On Monday, no juvenile cases were opened to the public. “A judge could unseal it if it’s in the public interest,” Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said of the Fawnbrook case. But he doesn't expect it to be. Juvenile cases involving sexual misconduct are “not that uncommon,” the prosecutor said. The reason for sealing juvenile cases is to protect juvenile perpetrators as much as to protect victims. As for protecting victims, Twin Falls Police Chief Craig Kingsbury addressed that Monday night while briefing the Twin Falls City Council on the case, saying sexual assaults take time to investigate properly and “can’t be done in an hour” like on TV. He said most cases are reported well after the sexual assault occurs, and neither patrol officers nor detectives take statements from juvenile victims — that’s left to St. Luke’s Children at Risk Evaluation Services, or CARES, a team specially trained to interview children involved in sexual assaults. “The questions and question formulation when interviewing young victims is so important,” the chief said. At a CARES interview, the juvenile victim is in a comfortable, neutral place — not a police station — and the interviewers “are trained to provide questions that are developmentally appropriate for that child” to make sure the child can comprehend the questions, Kingsbury said. CARES interviewers are “properly trained forensic interviewers” who also interview young perpetrators of sexual crimes to try to find out why they commit such acts, Kingsbury said.	2016/06/20	factcheck
