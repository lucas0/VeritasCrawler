He has had personal experience of the effects of Alheimzer's through his late father-in-law and chose to donate part of the proceeds to the charity.Mr Buckley said: ""I have known Gordon King for about 20 years. I approached Darcey Bussell out of the blue and she was very willing to help from the start."" He accompanied Mr King to the Royal Opera House to do the original sketches and photographs.The launch also provided the latest project for website design company E-creation, also in Gerrards Cross, which Mr Buckley found through the Register of Accredited Service Providers supported by Thames Valley Business Link.He said: ""It was not only the quality of service, but the level of support that E-creation provided which was impressive.""The prints, priced between £225 and £265 are being sold either direct from Ever English Ltd at 31 Howards Wood Drive, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 7HR or via the internet at www.everenglish.com"	2015/03/17
http://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO	Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food	false	['Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/	2015/03/09	Share192K TweetMadrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January.The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient.The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch.A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure.The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before he died.The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola.They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life.At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans.The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies.However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing.The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons.More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-gold-formula	Claim: The Apple Watch Edition has less gold than typical 18k gold	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Dr Drang', 'Gold', 'Leancrew.com']	http://leancrew.com/	http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/apple-gold/	2015/03/07	March 7, 2015 at 10:53 AM by Dr. DrangTwitter user Sumocat got some blowback for this tweet:@marco_org Apple has a patent that can reduce the gold content of their 18k gold by half. veg.gy/ZhMF2— Sumocat ( @SumocatS ) Mar 6 2015 1:58 PMIt’s inartfully put (140 characters is a bitch), but as a practical matter he’s correct. Apple’s patent application is for a method that allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold.How can this be? It’s because Apple’s gold is a metal matrix composite , not a standard alloy. Instead of mixing the gold with silver, copper, or other metals to make it harder, Apple is mixing it with low-density ceramic particles. The ceramic makes Apple’s gold harder and more scratch-resistant—which Tim Cook touted during the September announcement—and it also makes it less dense overall.The karat measure of gold is based on the mass fraction. One hundred grams of 18k gold has 75 grams of gold and 25 grams of other material. If that “other material” is a low-density ceramic, it takes up a bigger volume than if it’s a high-density metal. Because the casing of a watch is made to a particular size (i.e. volume), not to a particular weight, the Watch will have less gold in it than an 18k case made of a conventional alloy.As an example, assume a conventional 18k gold alloy with 75% gold (19.3 g/cc), 15% silver (10.5 g/cc), and 10% copper (8.96 g/cc) by weight. The alloy will have a density of[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.15}{10.5} + \frac{0.10}{8.96}} = 15.6\;\mathrm{g/cc}]A cubic centimeter of this alloy will contain[0.75 \times 15.6 = 11.7\;\mathrm{g}]of gold.Now assume an 18k gold with 75% gold and 25% boron carbide by weight (that’s one of the ceramics mentioned in Apple’s patent). Boron carbide has a density of 2.52 g/cc , so a gold/boron carbide metal matrix composite would have a density of about[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.25}{2.52}} = 7.24\;\mathrm{g/cc}]A cubic centimeter of this material will contain only[0.75 \times 7.24 = 5.43\;\mathrm{g}]of gold. Here, the gold takes up[\frac{5.43\;\mathrm{g}}{19.3\;\mathrm{g/cc}} = 0.28\;\mathrm{cc}]or 28% of the volume.Table 1 of Apple’s patent gives other configurations and shows the gold savings.Some of these numbers look flatly wrong to me. For example, changing from a baseline of 25.8 g of gold in a particular part to 12.1 g is not a savings of 43%, it’s a savings of 53%. Maybe I’m reading the table wrong.In any event, the patent makes it clear that saving gold is one of the goals of the process. I suppose it’s not surprising that Tim didn’t make a big deal out of that in September.	2015/03/07
http://www.emergent.info/gold-Apple-Watch-straps	Claim: Apple will offer gold Watch straps	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Accessories', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	http://daringfireball.net/	http://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	iFixit : The free online repair manual for everything, written by everyone.Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize there’s little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point — in two days, we’ll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next week’s event. So let’s have some fun.First, there’s this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member “pgiguere1” created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruber’s speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell it’s not from Apple — the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way they’re used is wrong. But it’s close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. I’ve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if I’ve seen this “leaked price list”.So let’s put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. It’s speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, it’s off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1’s speculation that I hadn’t really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1’s list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. I’m torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isn’t referring to the two sizes as women’s and men’s — some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 — but in broad strokes the 38 is the women’s version and the 42 is the men’s. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine “Modern Buckle” is only available for the 38mm size, and the “Leather Loop” is only available for 42mm.“Bigger costs more” makes sense — and it’s true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, I’d bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport — $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because they’re made from solid 18K gold. I’m not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Apple’s messaging back in September was misleading, and I don’t think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste — that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact — from my email and tweets — that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.I don’t think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThere’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendts’s first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought I’ve considered myself:Apple’s letting the $10,000–20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe it’s for the same reason: maybe the Edition won’t be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe it’ll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when it’s announced.That’s certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the “$499” slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPad’s entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment — everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The “best” iPad — 64 GB with cellular networking — cost $829, which isn’t that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we don’t know is how much the higher-end models will cost. ↩︎Previous:	2015/03/08
http://www.emergent.info/larger-Apple-Watch-more-expensive	Claim: Apple will charge more for the larger Apple Watch	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	http://daringfireball.net/	http://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	iFixit : The free online repair manual for everything, written by everyone.Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize there’s little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point — in two days, we’ll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next week’s event. So let’s have some fun.First, there’s this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member “pgiguere1” created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruber’s speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell it’s not from Apple — the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way they’re used is wrong. But it’s close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. I’ve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if I’ve seen this “leaked price list”.So let’s put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. It’s speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, it’s off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1’s speculation that I hadn’t really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1’s list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. I’m torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isn’t referring to the two sizes as women’s and men’s — some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 — but in broad strokes the 38 is the women’s version and the 42 is the men’s. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine “Modern Buckle” is only available for the 38mm size, and the “Leather Loop” is only available for 42mm.“Bigger costs more” makes sense — and it’s true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, I’d bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport — $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because they’re made from solid 18K gold. I’m not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Apple’s messaging back in September was misleading, and I don’t think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste — that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact — from my email and tweets — that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.I don’t think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThere’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendts’s first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought I’ve considered myself:Apple’s letting the $10,000–20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe it’s for the same reason: maybe the Edition won’t be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe it’ll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when it’s announced.That’s certainly possible.

I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits.

And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different.

There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThere’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendts’s first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought I’ve considered myself:Apple’s letting the $10,000–20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe it’s for the same reason: maybe the Edition won’t be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe it’ll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when it’s announced.That’s certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the “$499” slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPad’s entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment — everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The “best” iPad — 64 GB with cellular networking — cost $829, which isn’t that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we don’t know is how much the higher-end models will cost. ↩︎Previous:	2015/03/08
http://www.emergent.info/steel-Apple-Watch-sport-band	Claim: The steel Apple Watch with a sport band will cost $749/799 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	http://daringfireball.net/	http://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	iFixit : The free online repair manual for everything, written by everyone.Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize there’s little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point — in two days, we’ll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next week’s event. So let’s have some fun.First, there’s this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member “pgiguere1” created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruber’s speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell it’s not from Apple — the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way they’re used is wrong. But it’s close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. I’ve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if I’ve seen this “leaked price list”.So let’s put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. It’s speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, it’s off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1’s speculation that I hadn’t really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1’s list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. I’m torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isn’t referring to the two sizes as women’s and men’s — some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 — but in broad strokes the 38 is the women’s version and the 42 is the men’s. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine “Modern Buckle” is only available for the 38mm size, and the “Leather Loop” is only available for 42mm.“Bigger costs more” makes sense — and it’s true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, I’d bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport — $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because they’re made from solid 18K gold. I’m not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Apple’s messaging back in September was misleading, and I don’t think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste — that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact — from my email and tweets — that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.I don’t think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame.

And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.I don’t think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThere’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendts’s first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought I’ve considered myself:Apple’s letting the $10,000–20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe it’s for the same reason: maybe the Edition won’t be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe it’ll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when it’s announced.That’s certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the “$499” slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPad’s entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment — everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The “best” iPad — 64 GB with cellular networking — cost $829, which isn’t that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we don’t know is how much the higher-end models will cost. ↩︎Previous:	2015/03/08
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-notifications-wrist	Claim: The Apple Watch only receives notifications when on the wrist	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Features', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	http://techcrunch.com/	http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/06/the-apple-watch-is-time-saved/#InYuXY:HADe	2015/03/06	Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch, I’ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it. There are a lot of interesting details, some of which we’ll get into. But, by far, the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one. After these discussions, it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day. People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far, far less than they used to. A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone, unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. That’s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade. There are a few ways Apple is making this happen. Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could. For example, it takes your heart rate periodically, providing you with a last-checked time, which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes. Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications. The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone — both on the developer and user side of things. These are seen right away rather than at some point. You act on them quickly and they don’t stack up like they do on the phone. There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it, which means that time-sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. If you’re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be. And, as a user, those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen, allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding, unlocking or other junk. These are immediate, actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone. MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small, there has been a lot of talk about its use as a “notification window.” Yes, notifications are a powerful part of it, but the mechanics of the device actually support much, much more than that. People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive. This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily. (As a note, the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the “hot” spots for apps will be at the edges, rather than the center. This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app. Your “bottom row” will become your “outer ring.”)The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist. When your attention is on the Watch, you’re going to want to do more there than you think, rather than having to move over to your phone. This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist. This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps. They shouldn’t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones; there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they’re doing. Battery life is also much better than some previous reports, so Apple has been working on it. In a normal day of on-and-off use, the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent, which means that you should be able to make it through a full day. It only takes around two hours to charge fully. The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity. This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen, as you’re not chasing the scroll with your finger. It’s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off, and now has more friction for a weightier, higher-end feel. Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri, which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch. It can be used for labeling, directions, commands executed by the phone and more. If — and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me — if it is truly a “say it and forget it” experience, the confidence in using your wrist as a “commander” for your life is expansive. Why Watch? So, let’s discuss. Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a $500 accessory to return to a normal life? Sure. But such is the deal. You’re not going to give up your smartphone. That Faustian bargain has already been struck. We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar. But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and, more importantly, time back to you. If you argue the Watch isn’t going to sell or do well, it’s worth pointing out that there are very, very, very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME. This will be the Apple Watch metric to track: time saved. We’re getting a tad metaphysical here, but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time. Kings don’t have more of it than peasants. Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch (or even an iPhone), but if they’re in an economic situation where that’s feasible then they’re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time. And that is the target market of the Apple Watch. Not “rich people” (though there’s a model specially for them), not “tech geeks” and not “Apple fanatics.” It’s people who want more time, and that is a very large target. This, for some reason, is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating. This is the primary use case of the Watch. It’s not just that it’s a “notification center”; it’s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction. For now, the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives. But one day something will come along to destroy it. And, as Apple has expressed many times in the past, it is willing to be the one that finds that thing. With the Apple Watch, we could be seeing the beginnings of that process. Perhaps someday, the Apple Watch could do the impossible: it could make you stop using your phone.

http://www.emergent.info/international-school-lunches	Claim: Photos comparing school lunches from around the world include a meagre offering from the U.S.	false	['Michelle Obama', 'Photos', 'School Lunches', 'United States of America']	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2958640/Photos-school-lunches-served-world-reveal-just-meager-America-s-meals-compared-cash-strapped-nations.html	2015/03/02	Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky.Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll.The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough. What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nationsThe first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients. Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com. But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David, Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page. Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren. While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items. Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow. Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink UK school dinner of frankfurters and beans, a baked potato, corn on the cob, slice of melon and a box drink Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes (courtesy Sweetgreen) In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish School lunch in Alba, Spain (left): white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peasIn France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie. This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans. And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples. The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive. A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries. more videos123Watch video Tony Blair: Second referendum is only way to resolve BrexitWatch video Russian reality TV star launches jealous attack on his girlfriendWatch video 'It's not gonna happen': Philip Schofield gives May a hard timeWatch video The latest Lotto draw results from Saturday 1st December 2018Watch video People burn cars and trees in Paris as protest turns violentWatch video Police investigate scene where man was shot in Lacock CloseWatch video French riot police violently beat a lone protester in Paris streetWatch video Theresa May says 'there's a lot more for me still to do'Watch video Katya Jones accidentally headbutts husband in Strictly rehearsalWatch video Sir Keir Starmer calls for a confidence vote in May if she losesWatch video Tractor driver tips bucket of manure over Lincoln Hunt SaboteursWatch video The 41st President of the United States George H.W.

This is accompanied by a small portion of pasta, a simple caprese salad of tomatoes, mozzarella and basil, a crusy roll and a bunch of grapes.

Such followers, who would become impotent, can be used as potent weapon against his enemies”.Hans Raj was a sadhu in Dera Sacha Sauda from 1996 to 2012 and worked as a musician for Dera chief’s religious programmes.Hans Raj said he was awed by Dera chief’s power. But when one after another sadhus who dared to raise voice against the chief were eliminated, he decided to face his fear by filing petition for a CBI probe in July, 2012.The court had then directed the state government to investigate the case and a medical examination found his testis surgically removed, which is in sync with his claims that over 400 followers were castrated at Sirsa Dera. On why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation. “Castrated followers were not allowed to meet their family or venture outside DSS campus on their own,” he said.While handing over the probe to CBI, the HC had observed that Haryana police’s investigation was worthless.Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya Insan rubbished the allegations. He said all the allegations were false and baseless and the petitioner in the case had left dera 3 years ago. He said the controversies were the handiwork of drug mafia who were up in arms against them.First Published: Dec 27, 2014 20:44 IST	2014/12/27

Scroll down for video Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right).

Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to. DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.' When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlersIt is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day. DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video postsLike others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'. The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighbours The entrance to the gated community where DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videos DeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a year Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquartersBut the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando. Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?' Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried awaySome of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biographyDaily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls.	2015/02/24

(Updated: Feb. 24, 2015 8:49 P.M.)GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.Related	2015/02/22

He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”The shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”This story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts	2015/02/21
http://www.emergent.info/priest-says-god-is-female	Claim: A Catholic priest who was declared clinically dead says he met God and she's a woman	false	['Catholic Church', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/catholic-priest-who-died-for-48-minutes-claims-that-god-is-a-woman/	2015/02/22	Share8K TweetBoston | A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal ONeal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.Doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital say that Father ONeal is extremely lucky to be alive, while he is convinced that it is God who sent him back to tell the world who she really is.The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead.He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like Being of Light.Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting states the Catholic priest. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mothers embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesnt disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. OMalley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father Oneal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isnt a female.Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father ONeal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the Holy Mother.I wish to continue preaching says the elderly cleric. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman...The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father ONeal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

Read MoreRAMPUR: All was going well at the wedding ceremony of 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, a resident of Moradabad, and his 23-year-old bride Indira from Rampur. That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishore’s medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the ""varmala"" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven ""pheras"".Meanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.Kishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used — spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm.Kishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district, which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO, Milak police station, RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding.“Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" Solanki said. ""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.”Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News .FROM AROUND THE WEB"	2015/02/17
http://www.emergent.info/ISIS-harvesting-organs	Claim: ISIS is harvesting and selling human organs to help fund its operations	unverified	['Iraq', 'ISIS', 'Medicine', 'Organ Harvesting']	http://www.al-monitor.com/	http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/12/islamic-state-financing-funding-human-trafficking-extortion.html#	2015/02/18	Islamic State reaps profits from organ traffickingAuthor Nassir al-Hassoun December 5, 2014pArticle SummaryThe militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.REUTERSAn Islamic State militant uses a megaphone to announce to residents of Tabqa city that Tabqa air base has fallen to Islamic State militants, in nearby Raqqa city, Aug. 24, 2014.The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding .According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding . The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking . The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering.Continue reading this article by registering and get unlimited access to:The award-winning Middle East Lobbying - The Influence GameArchived articles	2014/12/05

However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Quote:As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb.Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))Quote:Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate.They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection."	2014/01/06
http://www.emergent.info/feminist-blogger-abortion	Claim: A woman aborted a fetus after discovering it was male	unverified	['Abortion', 'Blogging', 'Feminism', 'Hoaxes']	http://injusticestories.com/	http://injusticestories.com/i-aborted-my-baby-because-it-was-a-boy/	2015/02/11	I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy12083Facebook TwitterShareOver the past 3 years, I have lost many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me. I now know that these are “adults” who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 – Editor’s note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasn’t really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for women’s rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldn’t talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me “B****** like you need to learn their place”. Stunned, I screamed “ASSAULT!” while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene. [sociallocker id=”86″] As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* – Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldn’t make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off – time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call “Sandy” did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. “Would you like to know the gender?” Sandy asked. I thought to myself “That machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldn’t tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted to”“Sure” was my response.“It’s a boy”…..……“What?” I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. “JUST STOP RIGHT HERE” I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just….sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldn’t bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didn’t matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think “These men aren’t so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?”Not all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on “I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy”My internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because it’s a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesn’t all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. It’s all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this. I feel like you’re taking the wrong mentality with this. Part of how we change society is by teaching our children. If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality. He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth. I’m not saying a girl doesn’t also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality. I support a woman’s right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary. Be it an inability to care for the child, the woman’s life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few. However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as it’s extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway. Nothing can be changed and what you’ve done cannot be taken back so I won’t dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender. If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them what’s right so they can pass it down. If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter. The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all you’re doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesn’t matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:’’Teach them to be strong like you currently are’’….Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You don’t deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you won’t damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss. Your son would have loved you with all his heart. You would have been the most beautiful woman in the world to him. You would have been the most important person in his life forever.You won’t know the caring, loving man he could have been. You won’t know how great men can be…how great your son could have been. Your loss.Paul says:January 29, 2015 at 4:50 pmWhy is his value defined in terms of what he could do for her? He has value just because he’s human. I think the greater loss is his but I dread to think what his life would have been like with a mother like that.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:This almost made me cry I’m a sucker for words of sadness…but so trueCorey says:You are not a Feminist. You are a misandrist, plain and simple.Jen says:that’s the most immature thing done by a sane adult.unborn says:You clearly have no idea what assault is.Ted says:January 25, 2015 at 6:37 pmWhile I find the choice horrendous, I can’t fault the logic involved. If abortion is truly a woman’s choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice? As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion? It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter. It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to. And if the second is true, again, why should it matter? Aborting for ANY reason would be murder. (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child) In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant. The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, it’s entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point. In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Um…not clear on how a fetus can be called a ‘boy.’ It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person. It would certainly have been a feminist.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:She said, “I don’t see how she would know the gender- it’s an ultrasound, not a crystal ball” and ur rightTenny Mucho says:So, what was a wealthy person who flies first class and has a chauffeur doing going to an OWS rally?Me_Love_You_Long_Time says:Speaking truth to power, of course.Eline Piepo says:January 29, 2015 at 2:54 amQuestion for Lana (the mother): What are you going to tell your little girl, when she finds out that she’s actually only alive because mommy couldn’t stomach raising a boy? Don’t you think that’s going to produce a dent in her self-confidence, and maybe even her attitude towards feminism?calam says:January 29, 2015 at 3:08 amI am shocked and disgusted at this. YOU my dear are not a feminist, aborting your child because it’s a boy :-0.. The anger that fills me right now can not be put into words. Women like you give the rest of us who are feminists an awful name.I have a son, I adore him and he’s my world. . My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and we’ll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . It’s heartbreaking.I’m not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because it’s the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan “my body, my choice” a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex — that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And she’ll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that won’t change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel. On whatever the internet looks like then, she will find intelligent, thoughful and outspoken women like Erin Pizzey, Karen Staughan and the rest of the Honey Badgers. She will listen to what they have to say, see that it has merit and she will think of what you did to her brother.And she will become a vocal Men’s Human Rights Activist. You will have raised the next leader of the MHRM. Just by being who you are, doing what you do.Like making light of a horrendous crime. A man on a plane says something mean to you and you have the gall to claim you feel like you had been raped? Can you even imagine how reading such a sentence must feel to an actual victim of rape?But maybe you do. Everything that you write makes it very clear that you are harboring some kind of trauma. Maybe something really bad happened to you at some point in your life, maybe you even inherited it from your parents.But one thing is very clear: Joining a hateful ideology is not a healthy and productive way to process trauma. Therapy is.B20January 29, 2015 at 8:42 pmWhat the author is describing, frankly, is full-on, cold-blooded, willful, premeditated murder, and a hate crime against that. Misandry doesn’t begin to cover it. Whatever wrongs you may have suffered in your life, you had no right take it out on your child like that. That’s flat-out inhuman. And yes, you earned every bit of derision and disgust expressed in these comments.Duffy says:January 29, 2015 at 9:13 pm“One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally.” “……and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.”*Trigger warning* – Extreme Sense of entitlement coupled with a shocking lack of self awareness.Noneya says:January 29, 2015 at 10:36 pmThere is no love that is like the love a son feels for his mother. From infancy, tiny hands clutching helplessly, embracing the loving warmth of his mother’s touch, to the childhood years of bumps and bruises and the tender healing love that only a mother provides.And you threw that all away. There are no going back. When you are lying down at night in bed, cold and alone, maybe then you’ll feel consequence. When your bed is a few degrees colder, and the spot next to you is empty and barren, where someone with absolute love and adoration could have been, nestled lovingly against you.	2015/01/17

http://www.emergent.info/brokaw-wants-williams-fired	Claim: Tom Brokaw wants Brian Williams fired	false	['Brian Williams', 'NBC', 'Tom Brokaw']	http://pagesix.com/	http://pagesix.com/2015/02/05/tom-brokaw-wants-brian-williams-fired/	2015/02/06	You know youre in trouble when Tom Brokaw is out for your blood.NBCs most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadnt traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire.Brokaw wants Williams head on a platter, an NBC source said. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft.Brokaw, 74, was still the Nightly News anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk.Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it, the source said.NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale.Williams still took the anchors seat for his Nightly News broadcast Thursday evening and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didnt address the issue during the broadcast.He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News, a network source said.Many of Williams colleagues believe his claim that he simply conflated two versions of what happened in 2003.There have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously, the NBC source said.But we believe that Brians apology on the air speaks for himself. He admitted over time he conflated the events.NBC brass hasnt been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said.NBC bosses dont understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it, the source said.One longtime NBC employee who has worked with Williams on several occasions had a few dirty words to describe the celebrated anchor, calling him a real pompous piece of st.Hes an ahole, he fumed. Hes not a journalist. Hes a reader.Oh, the fireworks that are going off inside, he said. Its embarrassing. Hes the face on NBC. Hes a liar.Everyone knew it.On Friday, Brokaw responded to reports that he wanted Williams axed.I have neither demanded nor suggested Brian be fired, Brokaw said in an email to The Huffington Post. His future is up to Brian and NBC News executives.

She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,"" said Khoza.Khoza said he had been dating the schoolgirl since December.""We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I stilldon’t know how it got onto social media,"" he said.In the viral video that AENS has seen to verify the claims, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, who was in her school uniform, to the bed. She appeared not to notice that she was being filmed while they had sex.The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but doesn't see the point.""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won’t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,"" said Khoza.He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.Most read"	2015/02/02
http://www.emergent.info/McDondalds-pizza-still-being+served	Claim: Two locations in the U.S. are still serving the original McDonald's pizza	false	"[""McDonald's"", 'McPizza', 'Ohio', 'Pizza', 'West Virginia']"	http://o.canada.com/	http://o.canada.com/life/food-drink/attention-children-of-the-90s-you-can-still-get-mcdonalds-pizza	2015/01/29	Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath? Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time. In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza. And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course. It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps. And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask? Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing. McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonald’s headquarters says it’s not the exact recipe, but it’s also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test. Canada.com will surely keep you abreast if we ever get around to doing that.	2015/01/20
http://www.emergent.info/Texas-Sharia-law	Claim: A jurisdiction of Texas is now under Sharia law	false	['Dallas', 'Sharia Law', 'Texas']	http://www.breitbart.com/	http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/01/27/hold-islamic-tribunal-confirmed-in-texas-its-voluntary-says-attorney/	2015/01/29	Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims ‘It’s Voluntary’Islamic Tribunal Website27 Jan 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system. “The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal,” El-badawi stated. “The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her.” He called it “two paths to the same result.” The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation. It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the “dower” that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid. Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq (divorce).El-badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support, visitation, and custody. He said that in most cases, custody of children is awarded to the mother.Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.The website for the Islamic Tribunal states, “The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers. Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment.”It goes on to state, “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”In explaining Sharia law, the website states, “Stoning adulterers, cutting of the hands, polyandry and the like (all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice), are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law. In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari’ah. It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding, that is Criminal Law, to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms.”The website lists four “ judges :” Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr. El-badawi. It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes, divorce (Talaq) cases, community problems, serious family problems, and Khula.El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

http://www.emergent.info/IBM-job-cuts	Claim: IBM will cut more than 110,000 jobs this week	unverified	['IBM']	http://www.forbes.com/	http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcringely/2015/01/22/next-weeks-bloodbath-at-ibm-wont-fix-the-real-problem/	2015/01/26	"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.I am a Silicon Valley iconoclast who writes about technology.Share to facebookShare to twitterShare to linkedin[Updated on Jan. 27 with comment from IBM after fifth paragraph and on Jan. 26 at bottom of post. Click here to read a follow-up post.]I’ve been hearing since before Christmas about Project Chrome, the code name for what has been touted to me as the biggest reorganization inIBMhistory. Well, Project Chrome is finally upon us, triggered I suppose by t his week’s announcement of an 11th consecutive quarter of declining revenue for IBM. Project Chrome is bad news, not good. Customers and employees alike should expect the worst.To fix its business problems and speed up its “transformation,""nextweek about 26 percent of IBM's employees will be getting phone calls from their managers. A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork. Project Chrome will hit many of the worldwide services operations. The USA will be hit hard, but so will other locations. IBM's contractors can expect regular furloughs in 2015. One in four IBMers reading this column will probably start looking for a new job next week. Those employees will all be gone by the end of February.In the USA mainframe and storage talent will see deep cuts. This is a bit short-sighted and typical for IBM. They just announced the new Z13 mainframe and hope it will stimulate sales. Yet they will be cutting the very teams needed to help move customers from their old systems to the new Z13.The storage cuts are likely to be short-sighted, too. Most cloud services use different storage technology than customers use in their data centers. This makes data replication and synchronization difficult. IBM's cloud business needs to find a way to efficiently work well with storage systems found in customer data centers. Whacking the storage teams won't help with this problem.Project Chrome appears to be a pure accounting resource action — driven by the executive suite and designed to make IBM's financials look better for the next few quarters. Global Technology Services, the outsourcing part of IBM, is continuing to lose customers. That rate of loss — one Lufthansa-size customer every six weeks — seems to be holding. The size of Project Chrome cuts suggest IBM is trying to get three or four quarters ahead of the expected business losses. At this point IBM's business losses have become a self-fulfilling process with deep cuts followed by increasingly bad service, increasingly madder customers, and more lost business.When reached, IBM sent the following response: ""We do not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones. If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported. Last year, IBM hired 45,000 people, and the company currently has about 15,000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies. This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace.""The biggest reorganization in IBM's history will not really begin until the Project Chrome resource actions are done. People let go will be excluded from consideration for the new business units. In a few months those new business units will start to work calling on IBM customers to sell them on the new CAMSS (Cloud, Analytics, Mobile , Social and Security ) stuff. They will walk into a hornet's nest.Some reorganizations are well thought-out and absolutely essential but Project Chrome won’t be one of those. It will traumatize the corporation and put most accounts into immediate crisis. While survivors dig out from the devastation IBM will change their managers and their job descriptions. With fewer people and changing roles, things IBM has contractual obligations to do for its customers will start to be overlooked. If you are an IBM customer you should probably should start working on plans to keep your projects moving forward and your systems running.If you are an investor or Wall Street analyst it’s time to take a closer look at IBM’s messaging. Stop believing everything you hear from IBM. Big Blue is a master at controlling the discussion. They state or announce something, treating it as fact whether it exists or not. They build a story around it. IBM uses this approach to control competitors, to manage customer expectations, and to conduct business on IBM's terms.So while IBM is supposedly transforming, they are also losing business and customers every quarter. What are they actually doing to fix this? Nothing. In saying the company is in a transition and is going to go through the biggest reorganization in its history, will this really fix a very obvious customer relationship problem? No, it won’t.Response from IBM (via its Hong Kong office's blog) :IBM does not comment on rumors or speculation. However, we’ll make an exception when the speculation is stupid. That’s the case here, where an industry gadfly is trying to make noise about how IBM is about to lay off 26 percent of its workforce. That’s over 100,000 people, which is totally ludicrous.The fact is that IBM already announced, after 3Q earnings report, that the company would take a $600 million charge for restructuring. That’s several thousand people. Not 10,000, or 100,000. Moreover, IBM currently has job postings for more than 10,000 professionals worldwide, with more than half of them in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security and mobile technologies. IBM’s new cloud leader, Senior Vice President Robert LeBlanc, told Fortune this week that IBM has plans to hire 1,000 cloud professionals.A little perspective on IBM’s earnings is in order. The company still makes huge profit… $21 billion in operating pre-tax profit last year. And IBM’s “strategic imperatives” represent 27% ( and growing ) of the company’s total revenue… $25 billion in revenues, up 16 percent. We have high growth in a substantial portion of the portfolio, and those areas (CAMSS) have better-than-normal margins in areas that matter most to clients today — that’s the heart of the IBM transformation.I came to Silicon Valley in 1977 and helped start companies now worth a total of more than $1 trillion.

Animals are our brothers and sisters and what she has done to my eyes is comparable to mass murder she explains. She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth. I hope she goes to jail for a very long time Legal experts assess the 85-year-old woman could spend up to 18 months in jail for her crimes. Share962K Tweet	2014/12/15

Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’Â biological father.In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”	2014/12/27

Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry – ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.”	2014/12/23

Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald’s?

Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference.""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can impose censorship here in the U.S.,"" he added.Obama: Sony made a 'mistake'Related: FBI: North Korea responsible for Sony hackThe FBI has officially linked the cyberattack at Sony to the North Korean government.""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement.The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday.""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.""The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.""It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.""The email was titled ""Message from GOP.""

Others have rallied around Sony's predicament.George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying ""we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands"" -- but no one was willing to sign it.""It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,"" Clooney said without naming names.The petition said, ""This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,"" and it concluded, ""We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.""It's outdated now, since Sony did cancel ""The Interview.""

http://www.emergent.info/high-school-trader-worth-72-million	Claim: A N.Y. high schooler earned $72 million in the stock market	false	['NYC', 'Stock Market']	http://nymag.com/	http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2014/mohammed-islam-stock-trading/	2014/12/15	"ShareThis(Photo: Bobby Doherty)Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school.Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million.An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school’s Investment Club, was basically a genius.As the news spread, Mo’s stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of “ 20 Under 20 ,” and Mo became “a celebrity,” as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. “A VIP!”Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. “He’s quiet today,” said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. “Humble.” And tired: “This is our third meeting of the day,” Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. “We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you …”“Next we’re going to see a hedge-fund guy,” Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.“He basically wants to give us $150 million,” Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. “Freshly squeezed apple juice,” Damir said, passing them around. “It’s very good. Do you like caviar?”After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (“Aren’t you the kid who made all that money?” a teacher asked him.) So he “reconnected” with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, “the one percent of the one percent.”The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. “I call the poker game ‘Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. “Here, have some caviar.”Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. “There are a lot of steps we have to follow through,” said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. “But we’re on the right track.” They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. “Mo’s our maestro,” Patrick said. “He’s going to be earning the big bucks. We’re just going to try to fill his needs.”All three plan to attend college next year, but they’re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: “A billion dollars!” Damir said. “By next year!” Mo affirmed the number with a nod. “But it’s not just about money,” he added. “We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”“Like in Wolf of Wall Street!” Damir interjected. “And Mo is Jordan Belfort.”“No, but, not like that,” Patrick said, blanching slightly.Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of risk—the way his hand shook making the trade—but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said. He was 9.It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Mo said. “But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ” Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “high eight figures.” More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan—though his parents won’t let him live in it until he turns 18—and acquire a BMW, which he can’t drive because he doesn’t yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones’s Greenwich house for inspiration. “It’s because he is who he is that made me who I am today,” Mo said.Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. “A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think it’s a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating—”“Money never sleeps!” Damir added. “That’s from the Wall Street movie.”“It all comes down to this,” Mo continued. “What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400.“New York, that’s where the money’s at,” Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card.This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that’s where the money is. Damir grinned. “My father has a quote,” he said. “It’s really dope: ‘You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank.’ ”Patrick buried his face in his hands. “At the end of the day,” he said, “we’re young kids.”"	2014/12/15

Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isn’t “aware of any future plans” to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an “autonomous data machine” that provides a “commanding but friendly physical presence.” Basically, it’s a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (it’s 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there’s some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, there’s GPS and “laser scanning” ( LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences — like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that there’s a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things — or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes — but if you don’t move, an “ear-piercing alarm” is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isn’t equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isn’t just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, there’s also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ.Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when it’s running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard — plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something — a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, they’ll eventually be equipped with weapons — perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.	2014/11/17
http://www.emergent.info/amazon-streaming-video	Claim: Amazon will launch an ad-supported video streaming service in early 2015	unverified	['Amazon', 'Video']	http://nypost.com/	http://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/	2014/11/23	Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.The ad-supported option part of an overhaul of its media offerings poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. It wont be $99 a year.Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflixs current monthly price of $7.99.Who wouldnt switch if you were poor or youre a cord-cutter? he added.Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazons plans.The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesnt want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share, the source said.The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that its a definite go.Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesnt disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.While Primes big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazons broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including The Wire, True Blood and Boardwalk Empire. Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.Amazon didnt return a call seeking comment.Share this:FacebookTwitterFlipboardWhatsAppEmailCopy	2014/11/21

There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""The 19-year-old broke the news on Facebook (SWNS.com)In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward.Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.""It was really weird seeing her on television.""Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.Her furniture deliverer father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."	2014/12/23

The ongoing rodent problem at Vogue, however, might give some prospective tenants pause. Even Anna Wintour is worried.Multiple sources tell Gawker that the offices of Vogue, located on floors 25 and 26 of 1WTC, are dealing with a rat infestation.

http://www.emergent.info/seth-rogen-woz	Claim: Seth Rogen will play Steve Wozniak in a film about Steve Jobs	true	['Apple', 'Seth Rogen', 'Steve Jobs']	http://variety.com/	http://variety.com/2014/film/news/seth-rogen-steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-biopic-1201338038/	2014/10/31	Seth Rogen has been set to star as Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic, sources confirm. Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting. Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role. Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle. Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama “The Social Network,” has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011. Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987. Last year’s independently financed “Jobs” starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million. He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.	2014/10/30
http://www.emergent.info/matt-Taibbi--first-look	Claim: Journalist Matt Taibbi has left First Look Media	true	['First Look Media', 'Matt Taibbi']	http://nymag.com/	http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/matt-taibbi-disappears-from-omidyars-first-look.html	2014/10/28	"Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyars First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyars organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today. (UPDATE: Taibbi has left the company. See statement below.)Taibbis abrupt disappearance from the companys Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn.When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbis website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the simultaneously funny and satirical voice associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, editor of the Hairpin.Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people, Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. Its appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role.Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by ""independent"" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbis name at Rolling Stone and before that, as a co-founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look.Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbis absence, the launch date for Racket which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming in a month now appears to have been pushed off.We have a target date but I wouldnt make a launch date public, said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. I dont comment about internal matters and I dont comment on personnel matters. ... I mean were a private company, so why would we ... no.Related Stories .related-story .bg-story-CYdwEb7t .img { background-image: url(https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/07/magazine/07-matt-taibbi-encounter.w710.h473.2x.jpg); } Raging Against Hacks With Muckraker Turned Magazine-Maker Matt Taibbi .related-story .bg-story-caAqDkge .img { background-image: url(https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/05/08/08_matt-taibbi.w710.h473.2x.jpg); } Matt Taibbi Is Latest Journalist to Hop on Start Your Own Site Trend .related-story .bg-story-9rLuGIFC .img { background-image: url(https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/05/08/08_matt-taibbi.w710.h473.2x.jpg); } Matt Taibbi Is Latest Journalist to Hop on Start Your Own Site Trend Taibbis absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused digital magazines. In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the governments voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety.In August, Temple told me Taibbis site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics.Were supporting Matt in creating something unique and its Matts, Temple told me. Hes building a team and theres great esprit in Matts team.Taibbis clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalists own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring.UPDATE: Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company. Heres the full statement posted on FirstLook.org:I regret to announce that after several weeks of discussions, Matt Taibbi has left First Look. We wish him well.Our differences were never about editorial independence. We have never wavered from our pledge that journalistic content is for the journalists to decide, period.Were disappointed by how things have turned out. I was excited by Matts editorial vision and hoped to help him bring it to fruition. Now we turn our focus to exploring next steps for the talented team that has worked to create Matts publication.I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the kind of independent journalism found at The Intercept and the site we were preparing to launch. As a startup, well take what weve learned in the last several months and apply it to our efforts in the future.Above all, we remain committed to our team and to the First Look mission."	2014/10/28

http://www.emergent.info/ESPN-domestic-violence-panel	Claim: ESPN planned a special domestic violence panel that didn't include any women	false	['ESPN', 'NFL']	http://www.esquire.com/	http://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/espn-has-a-women-problem?src=soc_fcbks	2014/09/29	"Sep 26, 2014Rob Poetsch/FlickrUPDATE: The original opening sentence of this piece was widely interpreted as saying that ESPN was set to run a special panel, hosted only by men, which would address the specific subject of domestic violence in the NFL. In fact, we believed the pre-game show was to run as normal, with a segment on domestic violence. We apologize for the confusion that the language of our opening statement created and we have been told that ESPN was not planning to cover this topic in such a format and has covered domestic violence on air before with its female commentators . The first sentence and headline have been amended to reflect this change.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdditionally, we would like to apologize for saying that ESPN is not in the business of journalism. They have produced excellent journalism over the years, such as last year's NFL At a Crossroads: Investigating a Health Crisis .—Kate Lewis, VP, Content Operations & Editorial DirectorESPN has issued a statement in response to this story, as seen below.Statement from John Wildhack, ESPN EVP, Programming and ProductionContrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.Here is a rundown of tonight's show .On Monday night, during Monday Night Football's two-hour pregame show, I thought it likely that the regular commentators were going to discuss domestic abuse in the NFL. Last week, seven men, but no women, discussed Ray Rice's punishment in the opening block of Monday Night Countdown. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24 .When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.These people are not allowed at the table.On Monday, you will hear the voices of 11 men tripping over themselves to condemn the actions of one man who knocked his wife unconscious and dragged her motionless body into a casino lobby, and another man who head-butted his wife because she would not have sex with him.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowYou will hear their beliefs on the commissioner who did not punish Ray Rice appropriately and whose investigation into Rice's domestic violence incident is currently unclear, and might have been intentionally obfuscated or covered up.But you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar.""You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.Last week, ESPN suspended one of its editors, Bill Simmons, for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""a liar"" and daring his bosses to suspend him for it. They suspended him for it.Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: It is now time for you to walk out with him.This is the kind of moment that separates a ""journalist"" from a ""commentator."" What do you want to be?Simmons' suspension at ESPN will last three weeks—one week longer than Ray Rice's initial suspension by Goodell himself. Ray Rice punched his fiancée in the face, knocking her unconscious. Bill Simmons called the head of a corporate interest a liar. His suspension is one of the longest in the history of his company .Simmons' ascendence is credited to his willingness to say sentences exactly like this. By refusing to wait in line or repeat pabulum and talking points all the way to a potential columnist job later in life, he gained an audience. The network hired Simmons to absorb his growing readership into its offshoot Page 2 section, developing a major success in spite of itself.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowSimmons disabused the language of testosterone-soaked talking heads, and it worked. He avoided the intentionally adversarial outrage only created for TV ratings purposes, like the collection of recent controversies by Stephen A. Smith.Before the second, damning tape in the Ray Rice incident became available, Smith initially attempted to deflect the blame of Ray Rice's domestic incident onto Rice's fiancée , Janay.""What I've tried to employ the female members of my family — some of who you all met and talked to and what have you—is that: Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong actions. Because if I come—or somebody else come, whether it's law enforcement officials, your brother or the fellas that you know—if we come after somebody (who) has put their hands on you, it doesn't negate the fact that they already put their hands on you.""Smith had seen Ray Rice dragging a lifeless body out of an elevator and assumed the victim was somehow asking for it.He was suspended for one week for those comments. Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks.Not even six weeks after returning from his suspension, Smith was back on First Take, an ESPN morning debate show, having a partial statement read to him from the National Organization for Women about Roger Goodell and Ray Rice. In the statement, NOW President Terry O'Neill implored Goodell to resign. Exactly 39 seconds after hearing her words for the first time in his life, Smith said that the President for the National Organization for Women had ""lost her mind.""Advertisement - Continue Reading Below""I'm sorry, I think this woman is off her rocker. I think she's lost her mind. That's right, I said it. This is the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever heard in my life. Roger Goodell deserves to lose his job?"" he said. ""That's crazy. That's crazy.""It was a temper tantrum. Smith was not suspended. Simmons was suspended for three weeks. ESPN has no affiliation with the National Organization for Women. ESPN has a broadcasting agreement with the NFL until 2021.Still, this week, ESPN's ombudsman Robert Lipsyte called this ""ESPN's finest hour during my tenure.""Last night, Lipsyte defended Simmons' suspension with this sentence : ""Bill Simmons has no license to call him (a liar) without more justification than 'I'm just saying it.'""Six weeks ago, this is how Stephen A. Smith defended advocating for the discussion of ""the elements of provocation"" that could lead to a man hitting a woman : ""I don't think that's broached enough, is all I'm saying.""Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks. Stephen A. Smith was suspended for one.In the old boys club of sports media—one with no room for reflection and one that empowers only those who can speak about a base emotion in the fastest and loudest way—Simmons succeeded by writing differently. When his contract expired, Simmons was convinced to stay after ESPN promised him his own outlet, Grantland. The site has since produced thoughtful pieces from different voices—not just retired, bravado-filled athletes or 50-something male anchors who have paid their corporate dues, but also writers who would rather drill deep into statistics, experiment with art and new media, or write contemplatively, creatively and passionately, sometimes under pseudonyms.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowGrantland finally allowed for the journalism and opinions of, basically, anyone else.When female contributors write features for Grantland, they are equal—another voice amidst other smart ideas. Women at Grantland are not cast aside to a separate, less-visited section of their website. That's precisely what happens at ESPN proper, the home of ESPNW—a well-intentioned, largely ignored property at the bottom of ESPN.com , called upon only when ""women's issues"" affect sports.This is the kind of tokenism that affected FoxSports.com's Katie Nolan. In August, before the elevator footage of Ray Rice's domestic abuse incident was released, Nolan had the chance to ask Roger Goodell about why he didn't suspend Rice for more games, based on the first video. She didn't. ""I'm really going to hear about it from my bosses,"" she said. ""It's really not my role,"" she said. ""I played the role that had been assigned to me,"" she said.A month later, she understood this to be a part of a culture of quiet repression. ""Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,"" she said. ""Sometimes they even let us monitor the Internet from a couch.""She said all of this in a video on FoxSports.com. She ended it with, ""I'm ready when you are, Fox.""She was not suspended. She was applauded on the company's website .Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAnd that is the problem with ESPN and the old-wave of sports media: Sports are not now being infiltrated by ""women's issues"" that demand one-off responses. Women are half the population of the world—and sports are a part of that world.There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimes—and ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.ESPN personalities—even those 11 men—have spent the last two weeks on television defending their position atop a moral high-ground. Each retired player and 60-year-old man has had his chance to spout tough talk about how he would never personally commit or condone domestic violence.Now that their company is standing behind—as ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann put it— ""an enabler of men who beat women"" instead of an employee, where have these personalities gone?They are silent.Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: Those condemnations mean nothing if you don't stand up for your ideals, your integrity, and the rights of women when your paycheck is on the line.It means you, too, are just like your bosses: When faced with reporting the truth or collecting a paycheck—even at the most critical moment of your journalistic career—you will take the paycheck.It means every word spoken about morality from now on is simply just posturing to protect your public image.It means you are not a journalist. It means you are a commentator, for now and forever.So stand up. You'd stand for the defining issues of the moment: Corporate entanglement, equal rights, the idea of journalism, and your own integrity.You would be vindicated in the eyes of history during this very tiresome moment. You would be standing for the truth.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below"	2014/09/26

Superman Batmobile Been Stolen In Detroit? (UPDATE)Has The Batman Vs. Superman Batmobile Been Stolen In Detroit? (UPDATE)Posted by Rich Johnston September 12, 2014 CommentThe scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.It would not be the first time a Batmobile has been nicked in Detroit. Though that was just a $200 replica of the TV Series version back in 2o10.Anyway, if you are driving around and get overtaken by this……do get in touch.Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.UPDATE: Okay, well we didn’t expect that to happen. The story above got picked up by f ar more serious news organisations such as CBS who ought to know better. Thankfully the Detroit Free Press were on hand to scotch the story.Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.Unless… there are more than one Batmobile being used for filming.

http://www.emergent.info/nhl-vegas	Claim: The NHL will announce an expansion to Las Vegas in 2014	false	['Las Vegas', 'NHL']	http://www.theprovince.com/	http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Tony+Gallagher+Bettman+changed+tune+expansion/10150984/story.html	2014/08/27	Gallagher: Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansionTony Gallagher (The Province)Updated: August 28, 2014 9:56 AMFiled Under:EmailNHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the National Hockey League will ‘listen to expressions of interest’ in adding teams.Photo by Mark HumphreyIt wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.	2014/08/25

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said: “It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.”He said the restaurants were one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.CONNECT WITH THE SCOTSMAN• Subscribe to our daily newsletter (requires registration) and get the latest news, sport and business headlines delivered to your inbox every morning• You can also follow us on Facebook , Twitter and Google +	2015/01/12

Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday nights Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award. West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy from him. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down.Beck beat out both the nights top winner, Sam Smith, and the categorys expected winner, Beyonce.The incident was a repeat of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech after Swifts You Belong With Me beat Beyonces Single Ladies for Female Video of the Year.Yo, Taylor, Im really happy for you, Ima let you finish, West said after taking the microphone at Radio City Music Hall, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!West was roundly criticized for his action and was even called a jackass by no less than President Obama.After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, Peoples Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the West boycott.No more Kanye West on live TV!

http://www.emergent.info/manson-fiance-wants-his-corpse	Claim: Charles Manson's fiance wanted to marry him to obtain custody of his corpse	unverified	['Charles Manson', 'Marriage']	http://nypost.com/	http://nypost.com/2015/02/08/charles-mansons-fiancee-wanted-to-marry-him-for-his-corpse-source/	2015/02/10	This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson.Mansons engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book.Mansons fiancee, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone.Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Mansons remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenins Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money.But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. Hes finally realized that hes been played for a fool, Simone said.Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. He feels he will never die, Simone said. Therefore, he feels its a stupid idea to begin with.Charles Manson in 2011 (left) and in 1970APMansons and Burtons marriage license expired Thursday. They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months, says a statement posted on Burtons and Hammonds website.Burton and Hammond who uses the nickname Gray Wolf could not be reached for comment.The wedding was postponed due to an unexpected interruption in logistics, the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said.California prison officials would not comment on either Mansons medical condition or his whereabouts.Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, The Retrial of Charles Manson. Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail.According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Mansons corpse about two years ago.Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies.Manson and BurtonMansonDirect.com/POLARISHe didnt give them a yes, he didnt give them a no. He sort of strung them along, Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said.When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says.If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Mansons remains upon his death, Simone said.Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will, he said.Another Simone book, The Lufthansa Heist, about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with GoodFellas mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012.Share this:FacebookTwitterFlipboardWhatsAppEmailCopy	2015/02/08
http://www.emergent.info/snowy-owl-killed-mate	Claim: A snowy owl killed her mate because his penis was too small	unverified	['Animals', 'CEN', 'Poland']	http://metro.co.uk/	http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/08/owl-kills-mate-because-he-has-a-small-penis-5054093/	2015/02/09	A sexually frustrated snowy owl, nicknamed the Black Widow, has killed her mate because his penis was too small. Staff at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest in Poland where she lives, had introduced a male snow owl into her enclosure to offer her company. However, two days later, her mate was found dead and half-devoured. Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal said: ‘The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. ‘We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. ‘At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped. For any Harry Potter fans out there, this may change your opinion of Hedwig who was also a female snowy owl.	2015/02/08
http://www.emergent.info/miracle-cat-back-from-grave	Claim: A cat that was hit by a car and believed dead dug himself out of his grave	true	['Animals', 'Cats', 'Florida', 'Zombies']	http://humanesocietytampa.org/	http://humanesocietytampa.org/miracle-cat-comes-back-from-the-grave/	2015/01/28	"Miracle Cat Comes Back From The Grave! UPDATE! February 2, 2017 Here is how comfortable Bart feels in his new home: His mom purchased a soft, stuffed elephant as a Christmas present for her baby niece. Bart proceeded to pilfer through the bag, drag the elephant out, carry it to his sleeping spot and snuggle up with it for a nap. It’s been his ever since and is the only toy in the house the other animals don’t dare touch. The niece did receive a holiday gift, just not the elephant. UPDATE! September 14, 2016 Itâs Official, Bart is OURS! After 20 months in our care, countless hours of paperwork, and millions of prayers and well-wishes from across the world, we finally have been legally granted ownership of Bart the Miracle Cat to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay! But he was only ours for a few hours as his foster family prepared to make his place in their home permanent. At 1:00pm Wednesday, September 14th at our shelter we celebrated the end of the custody battle and, consequently, his adoption, with a âGotcha Dayâ party (“Gotcha Days” are adoption birthdays in the animal welfare world). In January 2015 Bart became an internet sensation after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing his way out of his grave. He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as âZombie Catâ but to us heâs always been nothing short of a miracle. Not because we believe he rose from the dead, but because his gentle spirit, will to survive, and resilience in the face of extreme trauma embody all that we love and admire about animals. He is truly an ambassador for second chances and continues to inspire people the world over. We love you, Bart, always and forever. var lsjQuery = jQuery;lsjQuery(document).ready(function() { if(typeof lsjQuery.fn.layerSlider == ""undefined"") { if( window._layerSlider && window._layerSlider.showNotice) { window._layerSlider.showNotice('layerslider_10','jquery'); } } else { lsjQuery(""#layerslider_10"").layerSlider({sliderVersion: '', responsiveUnder: 0, layersContainer: 0, hideUnder: 0, hideOver: 100000, pauseOnHover: 1, skin: 'v5', skinsPath: 'https://humanesocietytampa.org/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/static/layerslider/skins/', type: 'responsive', showCircleTimer: false}); } }); UPDATE! April 24, 2016 We know you haven’t heard from Bart in awhile, but he is still doing GREAT! In fact, he recently got visits from a couple of his fans. First, he and this special young lady really bonded when she was with us for Critter Camp. When he saw her last week he got so excited and rolled right over so that she could pet him. Second, this wonderful lady has been following his story since the beginning and came by to see how healthy and happy he has become. He was happy to show her the ropes of life at HSTB (sleep, eat, play, snuggle, repeat). And, finally, we wanted you to see how exhausting the celebrity life can be; here is Bart mid-yawn and ready for a nap after his morning of socializingUPDATE! February 23, 2016 Bart really is the sweetest thing but, every once in awhile, the cattitude comes out! While being visited by a friend, Bart promptly plopped on top of the toy basket so that the curious interloper would not have access. Silly kitty, we love you! UPDATE! January 13, 2016 See how Bart is doing nearly one year after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing from his grave! Thanks to FOX 13 News for shooting the footage. UPDATE! January 1, 2016 Happy New Year from our sweet boy, Bart! As you can see, he is fairly unimpressed with the festivitiesUPDATE! November 29, 2015 Looks like Bart had a little to much Thanksgiving. Well, he deserves it! UPDATE! October 30, 2015 You asked for it, you got it! Many of you have been wondering how our famous, one-eyed friend is doing. Well, he’s fantastic and happier than ever, and we’re still waiting on the courts to decide custody. Here, he is guarding the entrance to the break area where the staff keeps their snacks because, you know, he gets first dibs. UPDATE! September 22, 2015 Here is a picture of handsome Bart taking a moment out of his play time to pose for the camera. Such a silly kitty. He is doing well, loving life and getting more spoiled by the day. Still no news on the legal case with his previous “owner”… so for now he’s still living it up at HSTB. UPDATE! July 22, 2015 It was a snuggle up and nap kind of day for Bart. Or, is that the Princess and the Pea? Whichever, the more layers of fluff, the better the snooze! Still no update on the pending court case, we apologize! UPDATE! June 25, 2015 We post a lot about how much love Bart is getting, and he is! BUT, we may have neglected to inform you about how much love and joy he brings to US! He is a courageous, friendly, silly and affectionate kitty who greets us each day with happy enthusiasm and makes us laugh with his goofy way of jumping on our keyboards and trying to eat our lunches. Here, he made a volunteer’s day by giving her a cuddle and a kiss when she went visited him over the weekend. UPDATE! June 19, 2015 While we don’t have any information to share about the court case (still in process) we do have a cute picture to share. Yesterday, Bart got a visit from an avid fan and had a wonderful time showing off his skills with his favorite toys. The little girl had so much fun, she and her mom went out and bought him a laser toy then came back to give it to him and play some moreUPDATE! June 8, 2015 While there is still no news about the ongoing court case, we can report that Bart is doing very well in our care. He is a happy, playful and affectionate kitty who LOVES to meet new friends, like the little girl pictured here. She came in with her mom to finish registering for Critter Camp and was so excited to meet Bart. They played together for quite awhile and we’re sure she’ll be back to say hello. UPDATE! May 12, 2015 Bart had to share his space with a former adoptable who was visiting for the day. Bert the gentle giant, and Bart the feisty feline were doing great until the unknowing pit mix traveled too close to the room where Bart’s food is kept (behind and to the left of Bart). At that point there was a hallway stare down with kitty growls and doggie whimpers. The poor, intimidated pup quickly loped off to find a different office to nap in while Bart pranced around in victory. Note: Bert belongs to a staff member and is gentle with cats. We know him very well and he was supervised at all times, as was Bart. UPDATE! April 29, 2015 This lovely Canadian family was vacationing in Tampa Bay and took time out of their week to come visit with Bart! He loved meeting them and showing the children how good he was at chasing his toys around the desk. He’s an international star who just wants to be snuggled and loved! UPDATE! April 24, 2015 It’s getting pretty warm here in Tampa Bay, so Bart spent this lazy, hazy afternoon fishing. UPDATE! April 16, 2015 Bart helps comfort a nervous kitten who recently arrived at the shelter. UPDATE! April 14, 2015 Bart got a visit from a two-legged friend who came by to read him a story before his afternoon nap. [easingslider id=”24342″]UPDATE! April 13, 2015 Today, depositions began in the custody case for Bart. Ellis Hutson and Dusty Allbritton were deposed today and HSTB Executive Director Sherry Silk will be deposed next week. We wanted to let you all know that the case is in process. We are still hopeful of a victory so that Bart can continue to thrive (see pictures above) and find a loving forever home. UPDATE! April 2, 2015 Is Jack searching the basket for the perfect toy to share with his friend, Bart? Or is he simply hoarding all the goods? Either way, these two are TOO CUTE together! UPDATE! April 1, 2015 No April Fools joke here, Jack actually allowed Bart to nap in his favorite purple bed! They are becoming fast friends. Unfortunately, our staff member was without a desktop for a little while! UPDATE! March 30, 2015 Bart is a happy camper as he recently got the wires removed from his jaw and received some further repair to his palate. Dr. Justin Boorstein is very happy with his healing progress and how well he came through the surgery, although it will still be quite some time before his mouth is completely healed. He said that Bart should soon be able to start eating dry food again! In the picture above, he is happily giving himself a post-surgical bath while overseeing some of the staff in their office. UPDATE! March 25, 2015 Today, our good friends from Humane Society of Pinellas came by for a visit and got to play with Bart. He showed them his favorite toy and how he has mastered the art of snagging that ribbon! UPDATE! March 20, 2015 Bart got a visit from some young fans today and got to take his first unselfie with them! He continues to do well and will most likely get the wires removed from his jaw in the next two weeks. We’ll keep you updated! UPDATE! March 12, 2015 Bart got a visit from some very generous fans who personally presented him with his very own stroller! They wanted him to be able to get some fresh air, safely! These wonderful ladies from Sunshine Accessories in Tarpon Springs had a great time visiting with Bart and introducing him to his new ride. We can’t thank them enough! Â UPDATE! March 11, 2015 Today, the author of Buzz Beau Blatt the Wonder Cat sent Dr. Justin Boorstein (Bart’s surgeon) a signed copy of her children’s book In Honor of Bart! As you can see, Bart was much more interested in a snuggle with his favorite doc, but that’s OK; this book will be perfect for our Critter Camp to help teach humane values and the resilience of animals! Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt! UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, don’t you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes. UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer. UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff. UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didn’t budge from the bed or offer to share, but we’ll give it some time! We’re just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again! UPDATE! February 25, 2015 It’s been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to “oh I get what I’m supposed to do” to “SUCCESS!”. UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We don’t have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our staffer’s laps after eating his lunch. UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug. We know there are questions about Bartâs situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can. QUESTION 1Why did you change your mind about returning Bart to his owner? We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law.QUESTION 2Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center is stating that they have not filed cruelty or neglect charges against the owner. Is that true? Although no charges have been filed to date, we are still hopeful that the county will file charges based on evidence of violation of the following Hillsborough County Ordinances:Sec. 6-21 Rabies Vaccination RequirementSec. 6-22 Registration & License tags RequirementSec. 6-24 Display of Tag Requirement; Cat IdentificationSec. 6-25 Humane Treatment of AnimalsSec. 6-26 Cruelty to AnimalsSec. 6-28 Confinement to Property; Dogs and Cats at Large QUESTION 3Is the Humane Society of Tampa Bay using Bart to “line their pockets” (raise money)? The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No oneâs pockets are being lined. Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Bartâs story has gone into a restricted fund called âSave-A-Pet Medical Fundâ to pay for Bartâs medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money weâve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need. In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats. QUESTION 4When will the issue of Bartâs custody be resolved? As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined. QUESTION 5How can I adopt Bart? If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to communications@humanesocietytampa.org and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals. UPDATE! February 11, 2015– On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat. Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Societyâs animal hospital. UPDATE! February 6, 2015– We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence. UPDATE! February 4, 2015– We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows. He is also showing a good appetite and interest in eating. He still needs the feeding tube and his jaw will remained wired for another 6 weeks, but he is definitely on the mend. We are proud of the little guy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015– Well, Bart surprised us today by taking his first bites of food since coming to our facility on January 23. This is a very good sign of his continued recovery. Because he is unable to eat enough food to sustain him, he will still need his feeding tube for several more weeks. He receives feedings every 4 hours through the tube to ensure that he is getting enough nutrients. We are so proud of this brave boy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015– Bart is resting comfortably this morning but is still unable to eat on his own. Our Director of Medical Operations believes he will need his feeding tube for a few more weeks until his jaw and palate are completely healed. UPDATE! January 30, 2105– New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Bartâs home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life. The Humane Society of Tampa Bayâs Save-A-Pet Medical Fund, along with donations for Bart that we have received from generous individuals all over the world, will cover the cost of all medical care required and will help replenish our Save-A-Pet fund for other animals in need. We are not asking the Huston family for any money to cover any costs. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay had no involvement with the creation of the GoFundMe campaign set up to cover the cost of Bartâs medical care, nor have we received any funds from the account to date. Again, Bartâs medical costs are being covered by our own Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. Our concern is for Bartâs future. As always, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay is dedicated to the plight of companion animals in our area and strives to protect and promote their best interests at all times. UPDATE! January 28, 2015– Bart was struggling due to anemia. One of our shelter cats, Draco, was the donor for a blood transfusion to help Bart feel better. The transfusion went well and both cats are happy and resting comfortably. UPDATE! January 28, 2015– Bart came through his surgery very well and is resting comfortably in our care. He will be able to go home in 5-7 days once he is able to eat on his own. Full recovery will take about six weeks. He is a brave boy! UPDATE! January 27, 2015– Bart will be having surgery to repair his jaw and remove his eye today. We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake! Our public hospital is currently caring for Bart, a 1.5 year old cat who was found by his owner after being hit by a car. The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive! He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention. The owner reached out to area veterinary clinics but, unable to afford their fees, brought him to the our Animal Health Center where he is being treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye, which will have to be removed. Luckily, the injuries sustained were not more serious. HSTB veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to go back home. CLICK HERE to donate to Bart’s care and to help other animals in need! UPDATE! February 2, 2017 Here is how comfortable Bart feels in his new home: His mom purchased a soft, stuffed elephant as a Christmas present for her baby niece. Bart proceeded to pilfer through the bag, drag the elephant out, carry it to his sleeping spot and snuggle up with it for a nap. It’s been his ever since and is the only toy in the house the other animals don’t dare touch. The niece did receive a holiday gift, just not the elephant. UPDATE! September 14, 2016 Itâs Official, Bart is OURS! After 20 months in our care, countless hours of paperwork, and millions of prayers and well-wishes from across the world, we finally have been legally granted ownership of Bart the Miracle Cat to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay! But he was only ours for a few hours as his foster family prepared to make his place in their home permanent. At 1:00pm Wednesday, September 14th at our shelter we celebrated the end of the custody battle and, consequently, his adoption, with a âGotcha Dayâ party (“Gotcha Days” are adoption birthdays in the animal welfare world). In January 2015 Bart became an internet sensation after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing his way out of his grave. He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as âZombie Catâ but to us heâs always been nothing short of a miracle. Not because we believe he rose from the dead, but because his gentle spirit, will to survive, and resilience in the face of extreme trauma embody all that we love and admire about animals. He is truly an ambassador for second chances and continues to inspire people the world over. We love you, Bart, always and forever. UPDATE! February 23, 2016 Bart really is the sweetest thing but, every once in awhile, the cattitude comes out! While being visited by a friend, Bart promptly plopped on top of the toy basket so that the curious interloper would not have access. Silly kitty, we love you! UPDATE! January 13, 2016 See how Bart is doing nearly one year after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing from his grave! Thanks to FOX 13 News for shooting the footage. UPDATE! January 1, 2016 Happy New Year from our sweet boy, Bart! UPDATE! November 29, 2015 Looks like Bart had a little to much Thanksgiving. Well, he deserves it! UPDATE! October 30, 2015 You asked for it, you got it! Many of you have been wondering how our famous, one-eyed friend is doing. Well, he’s fantastic and happier than ever, and we’re still waiting on the courts to decide custody. Here, he is guarding the entrance to the break area where the staff keeps their snacks because, you know, he gets first dibs. UPDATE! September 22, 2015 Here is a picture of handsome Bart taking a moment out of his play time to pose for the camera. Such a silly kitty. He is doing well, loving life and getting more spoiled by the day. Still no news on the legal case with his previous “owner”… so for now he’s still living it up at HSTB. UPDATE! July 22, 2015 It was a snuggle up and nap kind of day for Bart. Or, is that the Princess and the Pea? Whichever, the more layers of fluff, the better the snooze! Still no update on the pending court case, we apologize! UPDATE! June 25, 2015 We post a lot about how much love Bart is getting, and he is! BUT, we may have neglected to inform you about how much love and joy he brings to US! He is a courageous, friendly, silly and affectionate kitty who greets us each day with happy enthusiasm and makes us laugh with his goofy way of jumping on our keyboards and trying to eat our lunches. Here, he made a volunteer’s day by giving her a cuddle and a kiss when she went visited him over the weekend. UPDATE! June 19, 2015 While we don’t have any information to share about the court case (still in process) we do have a cute picture to share. Yesterday, Bart got a visit from an avid fan and had a wonderful time showing off his skills with his favorite toys. UPDATE! June 8, 2015 While there is still no news about the ongoing court case, we can report that Bart is doing very well in our care. He is a happy, playful and affectionate kitty who LOVES to meet new friends, like the little girl pictured here. She came in with her mom to finish registering for Critter Camp and was so excited to meet Bart. They played together for quite awhile and we’re sure she’ll be back to say hello. UPDATE! May 12, 2015 Bart had to share his space with a former adoptable who was visiting for the day. Bert the gentle giant, and Bart the feisty feline were doing great until the unknowing pit mix traveled too close to the room where Bart’s food is kept (behind and to the left of Bart). At that point there was a hallway stare down with kitty growls and doggie whimpers. The poor, intimidated pup quickly loped off to find a different office to nap in while Bart pranced around in victory. Note: Bert belongs to a staff member and is gentle with cats. We know him very well and he was supervised at all times, as was Bart. UPDATE! April 29, 2015 This lovely Canadian family was vacationing in Tampa Bay and took time out of their week to come visit with Bart! He loved meeting them and showing the children how good he was at chasing his toys around the desk. He’s an international star who just wants to be snuggled and loved! UPDATE! April 24, 2015 It’s getting pretty warm here in Tampa Bay, so Bart spent this lazy, hazy afternoon fishing. UPDATE! April 16, 2015 Bart helps comfort a nervous kitten who recently arrived at the shelter. UPDATE! April 14, 2015 Bart got a visit from a two-legged friend who came by to read him a story before his afternoon nap. [easingslider id=”24342″]UPDATE! April 13, 2015 Today, depositions began in the custody case for Bart. Ellis Hutson and Dusty Allbritton were deposed today and HSTB Executive Director Sherry Silk will be deposed next week. We wanted to let you all know that the case is in process. We are still hopeful of a victory so that Bart can continue to thrive (see pictures above) and find a loving forever home. UPDATE! April 2, 2015 Is Jack searching the basket for the perfect toy to share with his friend, Bart? Or is he simply hoarding all the goods? Either way, these two are TOO CUTE together! UPDATE! April 1, 2015 No April Fools joke here, Jack actually allowed Bart to nap in his favorite purple bed! They are becoming fast friends. Unfortunately, our staff member was without a desktop for a little while! UPDATE! March 30, 2015 Bart is a happy camper as he recently got the wires removed from his jaw and received some further repair to his palate. Dr. Justin Boorstein is very happy with his healing progress and how well he came through the surgery, although it will still be quite some time before his mouth is completely healed. He said that Bart should soon be able to start eating dry food again! In the picture above, he is happily giving himself a post-surgical bath while overseeing some of the staff in their office. UPDATE! March 25, 2015 Today, our good friends from Humane Society of Pinellas came by for a visit and got to play with Bart. He showed them his favorite toy and how he has mastered the art of snagging that ribbon! UPDATE! March 20, 2015 Bart got a visit from some young fans today and got to take his first unselfie with them! He continues to do well and will most likely get the wires removed from his jaw in the next two weeks. We’ll keep you updated! UPDATE! March 12, 2015 Bart got a visit from some very generous fans who personally presented him with his very own stroller! They wanted him to be able to get some fresh air, safely! These wonderful ladies from Sunshine Accessories in Tarpon Springs had a great time visiting with Bart and introducing him to his new ride. We can’t thank them enough! UPDATE! March 11, 2015 Today, the author of Buzz Beau Blatt the Wonder Cat sent Dr. Justin Boorstein (Bart’s surgeon) a signed copy of her children’s book In Honor of Bart! As you can see, Bart was much more interested in a snuggle with his favorite doc, but that’s OK; this book will be perfect for our Critter Camp to help teach humane values and the resilience of animals! Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt! UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, don’t you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes. UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer. UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff. UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didn’t budge from the bed or offer to share, but we’ll give it some time! We’re just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again! UPDATE! February 25, 2015 It’s been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to “oh I get what I’m supposed to do” to “SUCCESS!”. UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We don’t have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our staffer’s laps after eating his lunch. UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug. We know there are questions about Bartâs situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can. We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law. Sec. Sec. Sec. Sec. Sec. Sec. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No oneâs pockets are being lined. Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Bartâs story has gone into a restricted fund called âSave-A-Pet Medical Fundâ to pay for Bartâs medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money weâve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need. In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats. As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined. If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to communications@humanesocietytampa.org and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals. UPDATE! February 11, 2015– On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat. Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Societyâs animal hospital. UPDATE! February 6, 2015– We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence. UPDATE! February 4, 2015– We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows.

Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed.	2015/01/17

I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there he commented laughingly, but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player he added with humor.The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighed 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839.The young boy of Zulu origin is reported to have grown to an impressive 76 feet or 2.28 meters high before he reached his 18th birthday.

Picture: SUBMITTED01 / 10Vet Faye Bethell used tiny instruments to remove one lump close to the fish’s anus, and another from its dorsal fin.The fish-lover had taken the sick, three-inch pet for a consultation at North Walsham’s Toll Barn Veterinary Centre, according to Miss Bethell, 29.At first he had baulked at the price quoted for the treatment and went away. But he had returned five minutes later and asked for it to go ahead.Goldfish, which can be bought for less than £3 each, can live up to 10 years. The ailing fish, which has made a full recovery, was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.Fishy facts■ Goldfish, which can be bought for less than £3 each, can live up to 10 years.■ Goldfish have a memory-span of at least three months.■ Goldfish can grow more than a foot long, but can be stunted by being kept in tanks too small for them and where the water quality is poor.■ Goldfish have no eyelids, so they have to sleep with their eyes open.■ Goldfish have been kept as pets for more than 2,000 years.■ The collective noun for goldfish is a “glint” or a “troubling”.The delicate procedure, which lasted about 50 minutes, involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish’s water.As it lost its balance, it was removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape. The anaesthetic water was then introduced into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills, through which it breathes.Using a miniature heart-rate monitor, Miss Bethell checked that the fish was properly “under” before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.She then sewed each cut with three stitches, finally using a special “glue” to cover and waterproof the fish’s scales before it was gradually re-awakened.Working with some weird and wonderful creaturesTaking lumps off goldfish is all in a day’s work for vet Faye Bethell, who spent one morning this week castrating a skunk.Cadbury, the chocolate skunk, had been brought in for the snip by his Scratby Garden Centre owners.Since opening Toll Barn vets’ a year ago, specialising in exotics, Miss Bethell has performed a varied range of operations. They include:■ removing a skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake, which weighed just 12g;■ taking out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig, at a cost of about £600, including post-op care;■ treating sugar gliders (a gliding possum) for a poor diet, and a degu (a large rat-like rodent) for diabetes;■ removing an air-rifle pellet from a Mundesley cat, discovered lodged under its skin during its routine booster jab check;■ working with wildlife rescue groups to save an injured sparrowhawk. Miss Bethell pinned its broken wing. It has since been successfully released into the wild;■ spending Boxing Day operating to remove a corn on the cob, which had got trapped in a dog’s intestines, as well as making a puppy vomit after it had eaten its owner’s pills.“There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets – but that was an expensive little goldfish,” said Miss Bethell, who spent Tuesday morning castrating Cadbury the skunk.The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals, as well as the more usual pets.The past 12 months have also seen Miss Bethell remove a skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake which weighed just 12g.She has successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig, at a cost of about £600, including post-op care.Sugar gliders (a gliding possum) have been treated for a poor diet, a degu (a large rat-like rodent) for diabetes and a cat from Mundesley, which was being examined as part of its annual booster jab check, was discovered to have been shot by an air-gun pellet, which she operated to remove.She also recently helped wildlife rescue groups save an injured sparrow hawk by pinning a broken wing, so that it could recover and be released.“It’s been an absolutely brilliant year with lovely clients and lovely animals,” said Miss Bethell, who spent Boxing Day operating to remove a corn on the cob which had got trapped in a dog’s intestines, as well as making a puppy vomit after it had eaten its mistress’ pills.“It’s exceeded my expectations,” she added.“I can’t believe the variety we have had.”Email this article to a friendTo send a link to this page you must be logged in.Most Read	2015/01/01

http://www.emergent.info/argentina-president-adopts-boy-werewolf	Claim: The president of Argentina became the adopted godmother of a boy to help stop him from becoming a werewolf	false	['Argentina', 'Christina Fernández de Kirchner', 'Werewolf']	http://www.jta.org/	http://www.jta.org/2014/12/25/news-opinion/world/argentinas-president-adopts-jewish-godson	2014/12/29	Argentina’s president adopts Jewish godson under law to counteract werewolf legendDecember 25, 2014 12:17pmArgentine President Christina Fernandez lighting Hanukkah candles with the family of Shlomo and Nechama Tawil, whose son became the first Jewish boy adopted under a law intended to counteract an old Argentine legend.BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.The adoption practice derives from an old custom by which the president adopts the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.The custom became a law in the 1970s and provided the boys with presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted. The original brief also stated incorrectly that the original law was adopted in the 1920s. It was actually adopted in the 1970s.

Police said the contents of the truck had mainly been from local sewers, but it also emptied septic tanks from public toilets from time to time.Spokesman Cai Chin said: 'No-one suffered physical harm, but many of those covered sought medical attention for fear that chemicals used in the cleaning process, or indeed diseases from the sludge, could cause harm to those affected by the blast.'

But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95 wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach.But dont get too excited. If you think youll be able to float around your house, youre wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends!

O’Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.	2014/12/15

CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.It has been the scene of some of the most vicious fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and the myriad rebel groups trying to topple him, but is largely controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ).CBS News' Khaled Wassef contributed to this report.© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

So how will McDonald’s define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.” For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.	2014/12/04

He flew 58 combat missions and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism after being shot down and rescued by a submarine.“They wrote it up as heroism,” Bush later told his biographer of the medal, “but it wasn’t — it was just doing your job.” His other military decorations included three Air Medals and the WWII Victory Medal.After graduating from Yale, making a fortune in Texas oil, and serving as a congressman, director of the CIA and vice president under Ronald Reagan, Bush ascended to the presidency as a Republican in 1989. Within months, he ordered U.S. forces to invade Panama . The invasion toppled a generic Latin America dictator who may or may not have worked for the CIA and was a forgettable success. But the move was widely praised at the time for giving the military a “soft ball” to help it get over its post-Vietnam malaise.By the end of 1989, probably because the Commies thought Reagan was still president, the Soviet Union crumbled. Sensing decisive victory was at hand, Bush skillfully talked Russian leaders into signing a “strategic partnership agreement” in which Russia threw in the towel in the Cold War in exchange for American promises that NATO would not expand even “one inch eastward.” This landmark agreement paved the way for NATO to expand 500 miles eastward towards Moscow and incorporate a dozen post-Soviet states, securing peace in Europe for generations.Bush won his second war in the Middle East in 1991 after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. In response, Bush assembled an international military coalition to expel the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait and shake the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all. American forces and their allies charged across the desert and killed tens of thousands of Iraqis, liberating the small kingdom and keeping the price of oil reasonable. In the victorious aftermath of the war, American held its last unironic military parade .Scholars agree that Bush’s victories enabled the military achievements of his successors. His actions to secure the contemporary rules-based international order and establish lasting American hegemony laid the foundation of contemporary American foreign policy.“He is the reason we have enjoyed three decades of unfettered strategic raiding by U.S. forces in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and probably some places you couldn’t even find on a map,” said Luke Schumacher, an international relations scholar at the University of Chicago. “As we all know, those actions which have secured core American national interests. We would not be here without George H.W. Bush.”President Donald Trump, among others, has praised Bush’s legacy.“You know, he got shot down — and you know how I feel about people who got shot down — and we could have beat Japan sooner, but, in the end, he was a winner,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “And who doesn’t love winning? America loves winners.”	2014/12/15
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-two-hours-charge	Claim: The Apple Watch takes about two hours to charge	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Battery', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	http://techcrunch.com/	http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/06/the-apple-watch-is-time-saved/#InYuXY:HADe	2015/03/06	Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch, I’ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it. There are a lot of interesting details, some of which we’ll get into. But, by far, the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one. After these discussions, it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day. People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far, far less than they used to. A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone, unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. That’s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade. There are a few ways Apple is making this happen. Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could. For example, it takes your heart rate periodically, providing you with a last-checked time, which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes. Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications. The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone — both on the developer and user side of things. These are seen right away rather than at some point. You act on them quickly and they don’t stack up like they do on the phone. There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it, which means that time-sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. If you’re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be. And, as a user, those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen, allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding, unlocking or other junk. These are immediate, actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone. MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small, there has been a lot of talk about its use as a “notification window.” Yes, notifications are a powerful part of it, but the mechanics of the device actually support much, much more than that. People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive. This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily. (As a note, the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the “hot” spots for apps will be at the edges, rather than the center. This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app. Your “bottom row” will become your “outer ring.”)The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist. When your attention is on the Watch, you’re going to want to do more there than you think, rather than having to move over to your phone. This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist. This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps. They shouldn’t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones; there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they’re doing. Battery life is also much better than some previous reports, so Apple has been working on it. In a normal day of on-and-off use, the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent, which means that you should be able to make it through a full day. It only takes around two hours to charge fully. The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity. This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen, as you’re not chasing the scroll with your finger. It’s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off, and now has more friction for a weightier, higher-end feel. Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri, which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch. It can be used for labeling, directions, commands executed by the phone and more. If — and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me — if it is truly a “say it and forget it” experience, the confidence in using your wrist as a “commander” for your life is expansive. Why Watch? So, let’s discuss. Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a $500 accessory to return to a normal life? Sure. But such is the deal. You’re not going to give up your smartphone. That Faustian bargain has already been struck. We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar. But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and, more importantly, time back to you. If you argue the Watch isn’t going to sell or do well, it’s worth pointing out that there are very, very, very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME. This will be the Apple Watch metric to track: time saved. We’re getting a tad metaphysical here, but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time. Kings don’t have more of it than peasants. Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch (or even an iPhone), but if they’re in an economic situation where that’s feasible then they’re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time. And that is the target market of the Apple Watch. Not “rich people” (though there’s a model specially for them), not “tech geeks” and not “Apple fanatics.” It’s people who want more time, and that is a very large target. This, for some reason, is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating. This is the primary use case of the Watch. It’s not just that it’s a “notification center”; it’s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction. For now, the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives. But one day something will come along to destroy it. And, as Apple has expressed many times in the past, it is willing to be the one that finds that thing. With the Apple Watch, we could be seeing the beginnings of that process. Perhaps someday, the Apple Watch could do the impossible: it could make you stop using your phone.

http://www.emergent.info/heart-rate-glance	Claim: The Apple Watch will include a feature called Heart Rate Glance	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Features', 'Mark Gurman']	http://9to5mac.com/	http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/sources-offer-hands-on-apple-watch-details-battery-life-unannounced-features-and-more/	2015/03/06	RedditJust ahead of the finalized Apple Watch’s presentation at Apple’s March 9th “Spring Forward” event, sources with hands-on Apple Watch experience have revealed a collection of new details about the device’s features to 9to5Mac. Our sources have offered new information on the Watch’s real-world battery life, health and fitness features, apps, and experiences using Apple’s next-generation touchscreen hardware…Power Reserve Mode and Battery LifeThe Apple Watch’s battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said only that the Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that Apple’s development targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app usage, versus 19 hours per day of combined usage between light app access, notifications, and Glances. Sources who have handled the Apple Watch tell us that Apple has improved the device’s battery life, noting that the final Apple Watch should be able to handle 5 hours of fairly heavy application usage, and it and won’t run out of battery during a typical day of mixed active and passive use. However, the source says that the device will still need to be charged nightly, as it will definitely not last through a second full day.As The New York Times reported , Apple will address battery life concerns with a new “Power Reserve Mode” that cuts optional services to preserve as much of the Apple Watch’s core functionality as possible. Our sources have shared several new details about the feature. First, Power Reserve Mode can be activated via a Battery Glance that’s accessible at any time, or via the Apple Watch’s Settings application. The Battery Glance will show the percentage of battery life remaining, the amount of time since the last full charge, and a large button to activate Power Reserve Mode.Power Reserve Mode can even be accessed when the Watch has a full 100% charge, and it is not solely activated when the Watch’s battery life is low. The mode noticeably dims the display, slows down communication with the iPhone to an on-demand level, and puts the display to sleep after roughly two seconds of inactivity. One unit tested allowed access to all Apple Watch functions while in Power Reserve mode, while another unit was limited to the Clock face. We’re told that some test units took between four and five hours to charge up to 100% from 0% via the wall-attached MagSafe charger. This is a notable improvement, we’re told, from fall 2014 prototypes.Unlike the iPhone, when battery life is low on the Apple Watch, the device does not show a modal popup window indicating the battery life percentage remaining. Instead, with 20% battery life remaining, the Battery Life glance turns an orange/amber color as a subtle alert to the user. At 10%, the glance turns from orange/amber to a red color. On the iPhone side, our sources say that they did not see any “meaningful” change to the iPhone’s battery while using the Apple Watch.Heart Rate GlanceOne notable yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch feature is the Heart Rate Glance. Thanks to the device’s heart rate monitor, the Heart Rate Glance will allow the user to see their Beats Per Minute at any time. When accessing the Glance, an outline of a heart will appear, similar to the heart in the image above. After a button is tapped to start measurement, the screen will show the constantly updating BPM reading. Our sources say that the process of reading the heart rate was almost instant and the readings were “seemingly accurate.” Previously, Apple has only stated that the Heart Rate sensor will be used to send other users their heart beat via the communication features and to measure intensity for calorie reading in the fitness app. Of course, heart rate readings could be transferred to the Health application on the accompanying iPhone.Notification Center, Glances, and Clock FacesOur sources indicate that the following Glances are installed on the Apple Watch by default, in addition to Heart Rate and Battery Life: Fitness Stats, Activity, Clock, Weather, Music, Quick Settings, Calendar and Maps. As discussed on one of our recent Happy Hour podcasts , sources also indicate that the Apple Watch will have a full Notification Center like the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. To access Notification Center, a user can swipe down from the top of the display in any screen. The list of notifications will show each app name as well as truncated descriptions of the alerts, akin to an iPhone. Developers will be able to customize which notifications can show up in Notification Center as well as the Apple Watch app icon specific to this view. As for Clock Faces a source says that “the level of detail and customization is insane.” The source also called the quality of faces “incredible,” and said “each face is like an app in itself so it’s [a little curious] is not (yet) allowing third-party faces.” The source also said that the “astronomy Watch Face is smart: in one mode you can use the crown to scroll through time and see planetary alignments for the whole solar system.”Onboard Storage and MusicAs Apple has announced, the Apple Watch will be able to store music that can be played while unlinked to an iPhone. Prototype Apple Watches within Apple are said to include 8GB of storage; it is yet to be seen whether the shipping versions will all include 8GB. As we noted yesterday, the internal units also include Lightning connectors, which won’t be on the shipping models . Users will be able to specify individual songs, albums, and playlists to be loaded to their Apple Watches via a panel in the Companion app for iPhone. Users will also be able to stream music from the Apple Watch to external speakers or headphones over Bluetooth.iPhone Companion AppAs we extensively reported earlier this year , the settings for individual Apple Watch applications will be controlled by a Companion application on the iPhone. The Companion app has a dark black user interface with a glyph of the Apple Watch as the app icon . In addition to controlling various settings and music storage, the Companion app allows users to re-arrange the icons on the Apple Watch’s Home screen. This can be done from the Watch itself as well via a long press, just like on the iPhone and iPad. When a user downloads an iPhone application from the App Store with a WatchKit component, the Watch app is automatically installed on the Watch. Users can remove the WatchKit applications through the Companion app without deleting the app from the iPhone. Interestingly, if the iPhone is not connected to the Watch, third-party application icons will remain on the device’s Home screen, and the applications will still work for a period of time with cached data.Force Touch, Digital Crown + Voice ControlSources have praised the Watch’s next-generation force-sensing touchscreen interface, saying that “the screen feels like a giant button than you just want to press in the manner needed for Force Touch.” A source added that the feature “feels natural” on the small screen. Also, the Digital Crown input device is required to use the Apple Watch, as the Watch differs from the sixth-generation iPod nano in lacking pinch to zoom capabilities: it registers touches and movements up, down, left, and right. There is no keyboard at all on the device; all forms of input are handled with pre-populated options and voice dictation. Speaking of dictation, the menus within the Apple Watch label all voice control features as “Voice Control,” rather than as Siri. As we reported earlier, this initial version of the Watch OS does not support replying to emails, even by voice. Users will need to access the Mail app via Handoff on their iPhone to conduct replies.Speed, Display, and BandsPeople who have used the Apple Watch say that the device feels very fast overall, which is in line with our report that the S1 chip is comparable with the current iPod touch’s A5 chip . But there are limits. One source said that an Apple Watch with over 200 WatchKit applications became noticeably sluggish on the Home screen. It is unlikely that the majority of users will ever install 200 WatchKit applications, so this should not be a typical concern. The sources say that the display will light up when the iPhone is locked for all of the phone’s notifications, but if the iPhone is unlocked, the Watch will not light up for new alerts.A designer familiar with the quality of mobile device screens who has used the Apple Watch says that the “screen is the best [smartwatch] screen I have ever seen,” noting that “it’s like vibrant digital paper, and does not look rendered,” with especially “great” black levels. The source thinks that the smaller, 38mm version is “tiny,” but of course this will differ between users of different sizes. Apple’s Sport Band, the default on the $349 aluminum Apple Watch, is said to “take time” to get used to as it is somewhat difficult to put on at first due to the pin-based closure system. As for the stainless steel link bracelet, a source says that “Apple have seemingly got around [hair getting stuck between links] by having the case expand the links flexibility from the outer rim only.”Powering Off, Force Quitting and SettingsSome users have wondered how the Apple Watch will be powered off without a dedicated power button. Our sources say that it’s turned off by long pressing the large “communication button” on the right side of the Watch. When this is pressed, a confirmation slider akin to the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is shown, letting a swipe finish the shut down. Users can also Force Quit an unstable application by accessing the shut down screen and then quickly pressing the button on the right side. The Apple Watch also includes a Settings application that includes various toggles including Bluetooth and Airplane Mode. There is not a dedicated Wi-Fi settings panel, which instead will likely be controlled by the accompanying iPhone.Apple will officially announce Apple Watch pricing and availability on Monday, March 9, starting at 10:00AM Pacific/1:00PM Eastern Time. 9to5Mac will offer coverage of the event in the hours leading up the keynote, during the presentation, and afterwards, so please join us for more news and commentary then.Guides	2015/03/06

It is unlikely that the majority of users will ever install 200 WatchKit applications, so this should not be a typical concern. The sources say that the display will light up when the iPhone is locked for all of the phone’s notifications, but if the iPhone is unlocked, the Watch will not light up for new alerts.A designer familiar with the quality of mobile device screens who has used the Apple Watch says that the “screen is the best [smartwatch] screen I have ever seen,” noting that “it’s like vibrant digital paper, and does not look rendered,” with especially “great” black levels. The source thinks that the smaller, 38mm version is “tiny,” but of course this will differ between users of different sizes. Apple’s Sport Band, the default on the $349 aluminum Apple Watch, is said to “take time” to get used to as it is somewhat difficult to put on at first due to the pin-based closure system. As for the stainless steel link bracelet, a source says that “Apple have seemingly got around [hair getting stuck between links] by having the case expand the links flexibility from the outer rim only.”Powering Off, Force Quitting and SettingsSome users have wondered how the Apple Watch will be powered off without a dedicated power button. Our sources say that it’s turned off by long pressing the large “communication button” on the right side of the Watch. When this is pressed, a confirmation slider akin to the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is shown, letting a swipe finish the shut down. Users can also Force Quit an unstable application by accessing the shut down screen and then quickly pressing the button on the right side. The Apple Watch also includes a Settings application that includes various toggles including Bluetooth and Airplane Mode.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-5-hours-heavy-use	Claim: The Apple Watch will offer 5 hours of heavy application use	unverified	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Battery', 'Mark Gurman']	http://9to5mac.com/	http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/sources-offer-hands-on-apple-watch-details-battery-life-unannounced-features-and-more/	2015/03/06	RedditJust ahead of the finalized Apple Watch’s presentation at Apple’s March 9th “Spring Forward” event, sources with hands-on Apple Watch experience have revealed a collection of new details about the device’s features to 9to5Mac. Our sources have offered new information on the Watch’s real-world battery life, health and fitness features, apps, and experiences using Apple’s next-generation touchscreen hardware…Power Reserve Mode and Battery LifeThe Apple Watch’s battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said only that the Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that Apple’s development targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app usage, versus 19 hours per day of combined usage between light app access, notifications, and Glances. Sources who have handled the Apple Watch tell us that Apple has improved the device’s battery life, noting that the final Apple Watch should be able to handle 5 hours of fairly heavy application usage, and it and won’t run out of battery during a typical day of mixed active and passive use. However, the source says that the device will still need to be charged nightly, as it will definitely not last through a second full day.As The New York Times reported , Apple will address battery life concerns with a new “Power Reserve Mode” that cuts optional services to preserve as much of the Apple Watch’s core functionality as possible. Our sources have shared several new details about the feature. First, Power Reserve Mode can be activated via a Battery Glance that’s accessible at any time, or via the Apple Watch’s Settings application. The Battery Glance will show the percentage of battery life remaining, the amount of time since the last full charge, and a large button to activate Power Reserve Mode.Power Reserve Mode can even be accessed when the Watch has a full 100% charge, and it is not solely activated when the Watch’s battery life is low. The mode noticeably dims the display, slows down communication with the iPhone to an on-demand level, and puts the display to sleep after roughly two seconds of inactivity. One unit tested allowed access to all Apple Watch functions while in Power Reserve mode, while another unit was limited to the Clock face. We’re told that some test units took between four and five hours to charge up to 100% from 0% via the wall-attached MagSafe charger. This is a notable improvement, we’re told, from fall 2014 prototypes.Unlike the iPhone, when battery life is low on the Apple Watch, the device does not show a modal popup window indicating the battery life percentage remaining. Instead, with 20% battery life remaining, the Battery Life glance turns an orange/amber color as a subtle alert to the user. At 10%, the glance turns from orange/amber to a red color. On the iPhone side, our sources say that they did not see any “meaningful” change to the iPhone’s battery while using the Apple Watch.Heart Rate GlanceOne notable yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch feature is the Heart Rate Glance. Thanks to the device’s heart rate monitor, the Heart Rate Glance will allow the user to see their Beats Per Minute at any time. When accessing the Glance, an outline of a heart will appear, similar to the heart in the image above. After a button is tapped to start measurement, the screen will show the constantly updating BPM reading. Our sources say that the process of reading the heart rate was almost instant and the readings were “seemingly accurate.” Previously, Apple has only stated that the Heart Rate sensor will be used to send other users their heart beat via the communication features and to measure intensity for calorie reading in the fitness app. Of course, heart rate readings could be transferred to the Health application on the accompanying iPhone.Notification Center, Glances, and Clock FacesOur sources indicate that the following Glances are installed on the Apple Watch by default, in addition to Heart Rate and Battery Life: Fitness Stats, Activity, Clock, Weather, Music, Quick Settings, Calendar and Maps. As discussed on one of our recent Happy Hour podcasts , sources also indicate that the Apple Watch will have a full Notification Center like the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. To access Notification Center, a user can swipe down from the top of the display in any screen. The list of notifications will show each app name as well as truncated descriptions of the alerts, akin to an iPhone. Developers will be able to customize which notifications can show up in Notification Center as well as the Apple Watch app icon specific to this view. As for Clock Faces a source says that “the level of detail and customization is insane.” The source also called the quality of faces “incredible,” and said “each face is like an app in itself so it’s [a little curious] is not (yet) allowing third-party faces.” The source also said that the “astronomy Watch Face is smart: in one mode you can use the crown to scroll through time and see planetary alignments for the whole solar system.”Onboard Storage and MusicAs Apple has announced, the Apple Watch will be able to store music that can be played while unlinked to an iPhone. Prototype Apple Watches within Apple are said to include 8GB of storage; it is yet to be seen whether the shipping versions will all include 8GB. As we noted yesterday, the internal units also include Lightning connectors, which won’t be on the shipping models . Users will be able to specify individual songs, albums, and playlists to be loaded to their Apple Watches via a panel in the Companion app for iPhone. Users will also be able to stream music from the Apple Watch to external speakers or headphones over Bluetooth.iPhone Companion AppAs we extensively reported earlier this year , the settings for individual Apple Watch applications will be controlled by a Companion application on the iPhone. The Companion app has a dark black user interface with a glyph of the Apple Watch as the app icon . In addition to controlling various settings and music storage, the Companion app allows users to re-arrange the icons on the Apple Watch’s Home screen. This can be done from the Watch itself as well via a long press, just like on the iPhone and iPad. When a user downloads an iPhone application from the App Store with a WatchKit component, the Watch app is automatically installed on the Watch. Users can remove the WatchKit applications through the Companion app without deleting the app from the iPhone. Interestingly, if the iPhone is not connected to the Watch, third-party application icons will remain on the device’s Home screen, and the applications will still work for a period of time with cached data.Force Touch, Digital Crown + Voice ControlSources have praised the Watch’s next-generation force-sensing touchscreen interface, saying that “the screen feels like a giant button than you just want to press in the manner needed for Force Touch.” A source added that the feature “feels natural” on the small screen. Also, the Digital Crown input device is required to use the Apple Watch, as the Watch differs from the sixth-generation iPod nano in lacking pinch to zoom capabilities: it registers touches and movements up, down, left, and right. There is no keyboard at all on the device; all forms of input are handled with pre-populated options and voice dictation. Speaking of dictation, the menus within the Apple Watch label all voice control features as “Voice Control,” rather than as Siri. As we reported earlier, this initial version of the Watch OS does not support replying to emails, even by voice. Users will need to access the Mail app via Handoff on their iPhone to conduct replies.Speed, Display, and BandsPeople who have used the Apple Watch say that the device feels very fast overall, which is in line with our report that the S1 chip is comparable with the current iPod touch’s A5 chip .

http://www.emergent.info/19-million-watches-in-2015	Claim: Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watches in 2015	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Sales', 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Keith Bachman']	http://appleinsider.com/	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/06/bmo-forecasts-19m-apple-watch-sales-in-2015-with-more-than-half-selling-in-holiday-season	2015/03/06	"By Neil HughesFriday, March 06, 2015, 05:45 am PT (08:45 am ET)Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating.Topics:"	2015/03/06
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-diagnostics-port	Claim: The Apple Watch will ship with a diagnostics port	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	http://techcrunch.com/	http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/would-you-buy-a-smart-band-for-an-apple-watch/	2015/03/05	Would you shell out money for a ‘smart’ accessory band for an Apple Watch that added additional capabilities? More battery life, perhaps? The reason I ask is that the Apple Watch has a port that the company has yet to show off. It’s being used for diagnostics and direct access to the Watch operating system, but it’s feasible that could be used to connect accessories in the future. The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories. Let’s get this out of the way: As far as I know, smart bands will not be a part of the first Apple Watch version. But the existence of the port is interesting. Every millimeter of the Watch has been decided with purpose in mind. In a device so small and personal, you cannot afford to keep anything extraneous. Apple including this kind of port on what I believe to be the shipping versions of the Apple Watch means that it’s absolutely necessary in order to install the OS during manufacturing. Or for testing or debugging purposes — say, in an Apple Store. But that doesn’t preclude the possibility that it could be used to connect accessories in the future. Those accessories would likely take the form of bands that expanded the capabilities of the Watch in some way. One obvious way would be to include additional sensors in a band to gather more information about the wearer in health capacities. This could be a way to add sensors that measured stress, blood pressure and more — things the current version does not track. It’s also conceivable that a company like Mophie could build a Watch band that contained an additional battery for extended life (if Apple extends band manufacturing to other companies, which seems likely). Pebble recently announced a feature for its new Time watch called “Smartstraps,” which operates on the same principle. This first wave of the Apple Watch will be about seeing what developers can get it to do with apps. But, as we’ve seen with the iPhone, accessories are a big driver of Apple retail. Having accessories that not only augment the Watch aesthetically, but also operationally, would be big business. This kind of extensibility would be a great way to get around the “I just bought a watch for a couple thousand dollars that will be obsolete next year” problem. What if people that shelled out thousands could add additional capabilities by simply upgrading their bands? This wouldn’t help if most of the money you spent was on your hardened gold link band, of course, but it could alleviate the angst over having to replace a hefty investment down the road. While the port is on watches that are being used by Apple employees currently — there is always a possibility that the Watch version that ships to consumers won’t have this port at all (the Watch’s design has changed in small ways over the months since its announcement). There is also absolutely no guarantee that the port will ever be used for anything but diagnostics. But it’s still interesting that it exists — and to think about the possibilities. If you’re curious, the other slot has “Assembled in China – Designed by Apple in California” engraved inside. Update: Apple declined to comment on rumor or speculation. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port won’t be on the models that ship to consumers.This report was apparently referring to a Lightning port. The diagnostic port we mentioned above is both on Apple’s watches at the event (we checked) and in their videos released on the construction process. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port won’t be on the models that ship to consumers.	2015/03/05

Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcements—here's what we think will share the stage on Monday.Apple WatchEnlarge / Don't be sad, Apple Watch! It's almost your ""time"" to shine.Megan GeussNot quite hands-on with the Apple Watch, and the questions it doesn’t answerThis is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones.

That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year ( blame Intel ). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air ( Broadwell U or perhaps Core M ), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro ( Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD ). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren't due until midyear .Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumor proposes something totally different— a 12-inch version of the computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.Even if the latter product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the Retina MacBook Pros and the Retina iMac . There may be a transitional period.However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.iOSEnlarge / The Apple Watch needs an iOS update to work, so we'll probably get one.Andrew CunninghamNewest iOS 8.2 beta spills the beans on more Apple Watch featuresThe Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after. It's been through five developer betas and a new beta hasn't been issued in a few weeks, which is usually a sign that release is imminent. If you don't care about the Apple Watch, this update probably won't amount to much more than a handful of bug fixes, but that's fine too.Apple is also expected to announce a public beta program for iOS at some point in March, beginning with iOS 8.3 and eventually extending to iOS 9.0 (don't expect word about the next major iOS version before WWDC this summer, though).

Rumors about a new 12-inch ""iPad Pro"" spring eternal, but the newest item from a reputable source says not to expect it before this fall (if we ever actually see it).

Most iOS news is going to be about the way iOS interacts with the Apple Watch.And the restThe Apple TV was last updated in March of 2013 , and there's plenty of new hardware that could speed it up. Apple doesn't seem to have the 4K fever that most other consumer electronics companies are suffering from right now, but it would be a logical next step (the current maximum resolution is 1080p).Most of the Apple TV rumors from the last year or so have revolved around something entirely new, though—not a faster version of the little $99 black box, but some kind of collaboration with content providers that would integrate Apple TV functionality into cable boxes (or maybe the other way around).iPods haven't been touched since 2012, either, but the iPod Touch is the only one that could use new hardware to get better at the stuff it does. Its A5 chip dates back to early 2011, after all. Don't hold your breath, but if Apple intends to drop support for Apple A5 devices in iOS 9, now is the time to start replacing them.And that's the rundown! The Apple Watch is the only sure thing, but Apple usually uses events like these to refresh a few things at once.

http://www.emergent.info/apple-itunes-beats-subscription	Claim: Apple will not reveal the iTunes subscription service based on Beats Music at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple', 'iTunes', 'Mark Gurman']	http://9to5mac.com/	http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/05/apple-plans-relaunched-beats-streaming-music-service-for-wwdc-skipping-march-event/	2015/03/05	RedditApple won’t take the wraps off of its upcoming Beats-based music streaming service at its March 9 “Spring Forward” event, according to music industry sources briefed on the launch timeline. Instead, Apple currently plans to introduce the service, at least in beta form, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The WWDC keynote likely takes place on Monday, June 8th, and that’s the event where the debut will occur. The new iTunes music streaming service is based on technology acquired from Beats Music, including curated playlists, cloud-based libraries, and offerings customized to the musical tastes of individual users. The service will be priced as high as $7.99 per month, which is less expensive than current $9.99 pricing for Beats Music, Spotify, and Rdio…The service was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, but was delayed by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple. Some Beats executives such as Bobby Gaza , who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, have departed Apple in recent weeks. The new Apple-made service will also make way for Apple’s first entirely-in-house Android application , but sources say that delays to the Android app are also possible as some of Apple’s Android developers have also left the company. Apple has, not coincidentally, published job listings for Android developers in recent days.Apple currently plans to launch the new music service as part of an iOS 8.4 upgrade for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch following WWDC, but a final decision has not yet been made. It’s possible that the service will be bundled into iOS 9 this fall, which is expected to have a significant focus on bug fixes and stability improvements . The service will be integrated into the standard iOS Music application and will function similarly to Beats Music for iPhone, but it will have an entirely Apple-designed aesthetic that matches the Music app and iOS. On the Mac side, the new service will be implemented with an iTunes update.As for the Apple TV, the new service will be an app that replaces the existing Beats channel . Sources say that Apple is also finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store. As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month, but with reports of the discussions between Apple and content providers being in only “early stages”, it seems that, just like last year , content roadblocks could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future . As we learned yesterday regarding the larger iPad Pro, Apple will have another busy fall, so perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year.While the streaming service won’t debut at the March event, as some had hoped, Apple still has plenty to talk about. The Apple Watch will be the cornerstone of the event, where sources expect Apple to spend a significant amount of time introducing and demonstrating third-party WatchKit applications as selling points for the device. It is also highly likely that Apple will discuss the rest of the price points for the device and its accessories before the April ship date. Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air with Retina display in the works for this year, but it remains unclear whether Apple actually plans to debut the computer at the March event.Guides	2015/03/05

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-5000	Claim: The Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Marco Arment']	http://www.marco.org/	http://www.marco.org/2015/03/04/boring-apple-watch-edition-pricing	2015/03/04	∞https://marco.org/2015/03/04/boring-apple-watch-edition-pricingI’ve never seen a smartwatch that I’d wear except the Apple Watch. It’s not that I think the rest are all ugly — most are, some are less so. But they’ve all looked like too strong a combination of cheap, 1 absurdly geeky, 2 and chunky for my taste, even though I wear $40 jeans and a $10 black T-shirt every day. My outfit feels reasonably acceptable, but an exceptionally geeky watch doesn’t.I cannot look past my fashion preferences for a smartwatch’s functionality benefits. Looking good to me and making me feel good about wearing it is a fundamental requirement. Watches are a combination of functionality and jewelry for most wearers, often with the jewelry side as a higher priority.The biggest challenge Apple faced with the design of the Apple Watch has nothing to do with battery life or screen technology: How do you make a smartwatch that most people will want to wear?Everyone draws that line differently. A lot of tech people will see the Pebble Time or Time Steel as within those lines, but I don’t think it stands a chance in the mass market, especially the upscale market. To me, it still looks like a relatively crude geekwatch, and to everyone else, it’s going to look like a bad Apple Watch knockoff.Apple couldn’t release a product that didn’t appeal to the mass and upscale markets — they’re too high-profile. It would be seen as a colossal failure. People would call for Tim Cook to be fired and everyone would declare Apple’s impending death spiral, even more than usual.Lots of writers and podcasters have speculated that Apple now fancies itself a high-fashion company and wants the insane profit margins that could result from that, with the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition as the leading example. Most credible guesses, considering the price of gold itself and the prices of other high-end gold watches, predict the Edition having about $1500 worth of gold and a retail price between $10,000–20,000.What if Apple’s primary reason for offering the gold Apple Watch Edition isn’t absurd profit? Profit helps, of course. But I bet the primary reason is to get people using an Apple Watch who would only wear a gold watch.The Sport, assuming it’s the cheapest at $350, looks about as nice as the Pebble Time Steel in photos. It’ll easily succeed, but I don’t think it’s for me — wearing a watch with a plastic band just won’t make me feel good, and I’m not crazy about the aluminum’s appearance in Apple’s photos.I’ll probably get a stainless model with a leather or metal band. But they couldn’t just release the stainless one, because many people would consider it too expensive, heavy, or delicate for their use. They’d rather have a cheaper, lighter model that can take a beating without looking too bad.Just as they probably need both the Sport and the stainless line, there’s a high end of the market — much of which is ignored by and unknown to the young white American men who dominate tech and tech media — who won’t want to wear a moderately priced stainless model. They want the gold one, and many of them will buy it.But Apple can’t sell it to them at a truly ridiculous price without alienating their base. A $10,000–20,000 starting price would make the Edition relatively affordable compared to many gold watches but ludicrously out of reach for most iPhone owners, possibily alienating millions of Apple customers and tarnishing their image with all of the snobbery and exclusion that comes with the world of five-figure watches. At the same time, Apple needs to be careful not to fall on the wrong side of the Veblen effect by making the Edition too affordable, but I bet they’re looking to keep Veblen under control at a healthy level, not maximize its short-term profitability.Apple’s letting the $10,000–20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe it’s for the same reason: maybe the Edition won’t be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe it’ll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when it’s announced.I’m guessing the Edition is closer to $5,000: expensive and very profitable, but boringly reasonable for a solid-gold electronic gadget.(This may all be proven comically wrong at next week’s event, like most of my predictions — seriously, my track record is terrible.)In this article, I mean “cheap” as both inexpensive and being of low build quality, made from low-quality materials, or looking crudely or poorly designed. Being inexpensive alone isn’t a problem if the quality is there. ↩︎In the Google Glass sense. ↩︎◆Follow Marco.org posts: Twitter , RSS feed , or the alternate RSS feed in which link posts always point here first instead of their targets.Follow @marcoarment on Twitter if you’d like.© 2006–2018 Marco Arment	2015/03/04
http://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-hbo-now	Claim: HBO Now streaming subscription is coming to Apple TV	true	['Apple TV', 'HBO', 'International Business Times', 'Michael Learmonth']	http://www.ibtimes.com/	http://www.ibtimes.com/hbo-talks-apple-be-launch-partner-coming-web-service-hbo-now-exclusive-1835882	2015/03/04	"By Michael Learmonth @learmonth03/04/15 AT 2:28 PMGeorge R.R. Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV.​Stay up to date with our daily newsletterRelated Stories"	2015/03/04

Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-price	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will start at $4,999 USD	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Gene Munster', 'Piper Jaffray']	http://appleinsider.com/	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/02/piper-jaffray-pegs-stainless-steel-apple-watch-price-at-499-edition-at-4999	2015/03/03	"By Mikey CampbellMonday, March 02, 2015, 06:55 pm PT (09:55 pm ET)Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349 , analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers —Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition —each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"	2015/03/03
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-launch-Germany	Claim: The Apple Watch will be available in Germany at launch	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Germany', 'Mark Gurman']	http://9to5mac.com/	http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/02/tim-cook-says-apple-watch-will-be-available-outside-u-s-in-april/	2015/03/02	RedditSpeaking at the Berlin flagship Apple Store last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that the Apple Watch will not be exclusive to the United States in April, according to employees in attendance. Specifically, Cook said that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany during the month of April. It’s possible that the Apple Watch will launch first in the United States in early April, with Germany and other countries following later in the month, but it definitely appears that the Watch’s rollout will be more aggressive than the first iPhone and iPad launches…The iPhone was notably exclusive to the United States and AT&T for the first several months of the product’s life, while the iPad launched exclusively in the U.S. in April 2010 and was followed by launches in Europe and Australia over a month later, in mid-May of that year. Besides Germany, sources indicate that an April launch in Australia is also likely as Apple has already been training select Apple Retail employees on Apple Watch sales procedures by way of secret briefings in Sydney. The United Kingdom and France have both seen Apple Watch marketing pushes, so those countries are likely also in the April mix.The usual first wave countries for major Apple product launches also includes Canada, where Apple is soon planning to launch the Watch-compatible Apple Pay system, but we haven’t yet confirmed if those countries will be home to the new product in April. Apple has been heavily promoting the Apple Watch in China , so perhaps the wearable will launch to the Chinese market in or around April as well. However, launches in China could be delayed due to government regulatory factors. During his trip to Germany, Cook also stopped by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office to discuss consumer privacy and the offices of BILD to discuss Apple rumors, Steve Jobs, and the NSA.Asked if employees will get free Apple Watches (like when full time employees got original iPhones from Steve Jobs in 2007), Cook reportedly said “you’ve given me something to think about, I agree with your point, I think it’s great, and I think everyone should use our products. It’s a good point for me to think about, I’ve got some more plane rides to think about it on.” Cook also discussed the expansion of Apple Pay into Europe, reportedly saying:Apple Pay will be global, it’s not a U.S. program. We want it everywhere. We are working to bring it out of the US. It is going to take a little bit of time to do so. We want to be in Germany. We want to be in Europe generally this year. I don’t know if we will make it, I think we will. It’s our intention to get here as fast as we can.We previously reported that Apple Pay will arrive in Canada as soon as March.Guides	2015/03/02

Barring any last minute problems, I would expect to see iOS 8.2 released this coming Monday, or the following week at the absolute latest.DONT MISS: Is the Galaxy S6 really an iPhone ripoff? Leaked comparison photo lets you be the judgeAdditionally, we were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions. Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers.iOS 8.3 adds support for multiple new features and is filled with improvements in the operating system, though the biggest addition is support for the upcoming Apple Watch, which is slated to be released in early April. Apples event on March 9th should answer our remaining questions on pricing and other details.Additionally, stay tuned for the first The Boy Genius Report podcast coming later today with some thoughts on Apple Watch, the Apple Car, my struggle with the iPhone 6 Plus, and other interesting topics.

Chen', 'New York Times']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/technology/apples-new-job-selling-a-smartwatch-to-an-uninterested-public.html?_r=0	2015/02/27	Technology |Apple’s New Job: Selling a Smartwatch to an Uninterested PublicSupported byApple’s New Job: Selling a Smartwatch to an Uninterested PublicImageTimothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, introduced the Apple Watch last September. Other smartwatches, from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG, did not sell well.CreditCreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesFeb. 27, 2015SAN FRANCISCO — For Apple, the hard part — making a smartwatch — is nearly over.Soon it will be time for the harder part: selling the long-anticipated Apple Watch to consumers who, so far, are not very excited about the idea of wearing computers on their bodies.The first batch of smartwatches from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG did not sell well, nor were they particularly well reviewed. And wearable devices like the Google Glass eyewear that got mainstream attention — if not sales — were greeted with considerable skepticism.But Apple has been in this situation before. Most consumers didn’t care about computer tablets before Apple released the iPad, nor did they generally think about buying smartphones before the release of the iPhone. In both cases, the company overcame initial skepticism.The Apple Watch, which Apple introduced last September and is expected to be in stores in April, is a miniature computer worn around the wrist, with a touch screen and a crown for navigating the device. There are three different models sold at different prices and the bands are interchangeable.Apple has marketed it as a device that can appeal to a range of customers like fitness buffs and luxury watch collectors. But it has limited its functions, making it more like a watch, more easily relatable than a tech doodad that happens to look like a watch, said Ben Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies.“This is a brand-new category. Most people have no frame of reference with a smartwatch,” said Mr. Bajarin.In late February, Apple sent out invitations to the media for an event to remind people about the best features of the watch and share some new details about the product, according to two people with knowledge of the event. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, is expected to be the host.Apple is expected to say more about price. The starting price for a basic Apple Watch is $350. Apple has not yet said how much people will have to pay for higher-end models, like the Apple Watch Edition, which is made of 18-karat gold, though watch enthusiasts estimate that it will cost upward of $10,000.The watch requires a connection to an iPhone to fully operate.Inside Apple, members of the team that worked on the watch product, code-named Gizmo, say it was a difficult engineering challenge. Three employees briefed on the project agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity.In an effort to maintain secrecy, engineers testing the watch outside the office even created fake casing that made the Apple device resemble a Samsung watch, one person said.The people who created the watch have been described by Apple employees as an “all-star team.” Apple’s top designers and engineers who worked on its iPhone, iPad and Macs are all part of it, several Apple employees said. Top executives include Jony Ive, Apple’s head of design; Jeff Williams, the head of operations; and Kevin Lynch, a former Adobe executive, who leads the watch’s software development.Employees said it was challenging to cram powerful chips and sensors onto the watch’s circuit board, which is as tiny as a postage stamp.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.ImageMr. Cook during the unveiling of the Apple Watch last September in Cupertino, Calif.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. It also has a chip that helps it make wireless payments.Battery life was also a concern on a device so small, and engineers mulled over how the watch’s power should be replenished. The company in the past experimented with multiple methods to recharge the watch, including solar charging. Eventually it settled on induction, a method in which an electrical current creates a magnetic field, which creates voltage that powers the watch.Apple has said the watch battery is estimated to last a full day, requiring a user to charge it at night, similar to a smartphone. The company also developed a yet-to-be-announced feature called Power Reserve, a mode that will run the watch on low energy but display only the time, according to one employee.Apple will release the watch a bit later than it had hoped because of technology challenges. It probably didn’t help that several important employees jumped ship. Nest Labs, the smart appliance maker that was acquired by Google last year, poached a few engineers who were the very best on the watch team, according to two people. Among them was Bryan James, Apple’s former director of iPod software, who became a vice president for engineering at Nest in early 2014, these people said.Still, when Apple releases its watch in April, it will enter a market already flooded with smartwatches running Android Wear, a version of Google’s Android software system tailored for wearable computers.The results so far for Android smartwatches have been disappointing. About 720,000 smartwatches with Android Wear were shipped in 2014, according to Canalys, the research firm.Daniel Matte, an analyst for Canalys, said based on those numbers, it would be premature to call smartwatches a flop. He also predicts Apple’s watch will become the top-selling smartwatch next year.But it is unlikely to be a game-changer for Apple, at least anytime soon. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein research, thinks the watch will make only a modest contribution to Apple’s bottom line this year. He predicts that Apple will ship 7.5 million watches in the second half of Apple’s fiscal year.That is peanuts compared with the tens of millions of iPhones that fly off the shelves every quarter.Companies that make watch apps will probably play an important role in defining the purpose of the Apple Watch, similar to the app developers for the iPhone and the iPad.Tero Kuittinen, a director for Frank N. Magid Associates who does consulting for app developers, said he had talked to about 20 app developers about the Apple Watch. Most of them, he said, were “cautiously optimistic.” But they worry that apps for watches won’t be as lucrative as apps for phones because the tiny screen can limit features or — even worse — ads.David Barnard, an independent app developer, said he was expanding one of his iPhone apps to work with the Apple Watch. The app, called Launch Center Pro, can be customized to initiate different actions like setting the temperature of an Internet-connected thermostat or unlocking a door.He said he was both “bullish” on the long-term potential of the smartwatch and “skeptical” about what exactly people would do with it.“I really wonder exactly how I’m going to use it and how often I’m going to use it,” Mr. Barnard said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Apple Watch Is Nearly Ready, but the Public Isn’t.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Edition-cost-10k	Claim: The larger Apple Watch Edition will cost $10,000	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	http://grail-watch.com/	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/27	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-not-online	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will not be sold online or by mail	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	http://grail-watch.com/	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/27/the-case-against-the-10000-gold-apple-watch-edition/	2015/02/27	My post laying out why the gold Apple Watch Edition must cost $10,000 caused quite a stir, but Ill be the first to admit that I could have it all wrong. Its entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but Im much more interested in the reasons why: Apples manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!Apple probably doesnt want to reconfigure their stored to resemble the Bank of England gold vaults! image CCbyND www.bankofengland.co.ukHow To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isnt really true there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of apples and oranges: Theyre much smaller; theyre round; and theyre not Apple Watches!This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apples Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and thats an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.But lets say Apple didnt want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be crafted from 18-karat gold. How would they do it?Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics arent like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (RF) interference. Apple says theyll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesnt necessarily mean cheap outside.)This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the gold case could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, solid gold case, to describe the Watch Edition. Im no lawyer, but their crafted from 18-karat gold boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.The lugs and bars (thats the watch insider term for the things that the strap attaches to) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. Thats how expensive gold is.One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. Its pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms... (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. Its still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. Its more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!Why Apple Wouldnt Want A $10,000 WatchIts entirely possible for the gold Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldnt they want to pull a Vertu and cash in if customers are willing to buy?Lets return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a months pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)Then theres shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldnt ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores dont have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?Apple also has to worry about what a 1% product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on accessible luxury and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apples broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.Apple risks alienating their loyal customers with a 1% product. Could Occupy Apple become a reality? CC image by David ShankboneIt seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?Thats why Im sticking to my original predictions:The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ouncesIf sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessoryThe Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailersSome larger Apple Stores will add a private Edition Boutique (but not all)A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appearThe Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mailRelatedRelated PostsWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000Apple Watch: Its Not a WatchA Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaMovado 1891 Ultra-Slim Museum WatchLevrette Chronograph: Classic EleganceSeiko Giugiaro SCED035: Daughter of RipleyOrient Blue Ray: Weekend DiverYear: 2015Brand: AppleStyle: Smart watchCase: GoldCountry: USASource: Tags: Apple, Apple Watch, boutique, gold, retail, securityRelatedRelated PostsWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000Apple Watch: Its Not a WatchA Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaMovado 1891 Ultra-Slim Museum WatchLevrette Chronograph: Classic EleganceSeiko Giugiaro SCED035: Daughter of RipleyOrient Blue Ray: Weekend Diver	2015/02/27
http://www.emergent.info/Gruber-Apple-Watch-Edition-10k	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $9,999 USD	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	http://daringfireball.net/	http://daringfireball.net/2015/02/apple_watch_pricing	2015/02/20	iFixit : The free online repair manual for everything, written by everyone.On the Pricing of Apple WatchFriday, 20 February 2015After the gala announcement event in September at which Apple introduced Apple Watch and whatever last year’s iPhone was, I ran into SlashGear editor-in-chief Vincent Nguyen in the private hands-on area Apple had set up for select members of the media. I’ve known Vincent for years from various Apple events, and I always enjoy his perspective. I was actually looking around for him this time, though, because I really wanted to hear his take on Apple Watch. Vincent is a watch guy — he knows the watch industry, and his taste is excellent.We greeted each other, walked in, and started staring, close-up, at the lineup. When we got to the Edition models, Vincent said, with some excitement, “This is going to cost $20,000.”I’d already started thinking that the Edition models would cost thousands, plural, but $20,000 struck me as a price from Bananas Town. Vincent’s reply was something to the effect of, “Try to find a good 18-karat gold watch for less than $20,000. You won’t.”Here’s what I wrote back in September , in my initial thoughts regarding Apple Watch:In short: hundreds for Sport, a thousand for stainless steel, thousands for gold.Most people think I’m joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn’t be more serious. I made a friendly bet last week with a few friends on the starting price for the Edition models, and I bet on $9,999.The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don’t think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price. I think I was wrong to guess just $4,999 in my ostensibly sober published analysis.I can see which way the wind is blowing. For months I’ve been asking friends who might know — or know someone else who might know, or even know someone who knows someone who might know — whether my guess of $5,000 is too high for the Edition starting price. The answer has always been “No”. But the way I’ve been told “No” has given me the uneasy feeling that I’ve been asking the wrong question. I should have been asking if $5,000 is too low.I now think Edition models will start around $10,000 — and, if my hunch is right about bands and bracelets, the upper range could go to $20,000. I was off by a factor of two, and my friend Vincent, I think, nailed it back on the day Apple Watch was introduced.It’s All About the BandsLouie Mantia helped clarify my thinking on this by publishing this seemingly sparsely populated table of Apple Watch collection/band combinations . Study that for a few minutes, and you should come to a few surprising — to me at least — conclusions.One of the selling points Apple emphasized in September is that bands are easily interchanged on Apple Watch. You just press a button underneath and it’s released; slide a new one in and it securely clicks into place. And they showed a wide variety of bands: Sport, Classic Buckle, Leather Loop, Modern Buckle, Milanese Loop, and Link Bracelet. Six different styles, all of them — other than the Milanese Loop — in multiple colors.I walked out of the event under the assumption that all of these bands would be available to purchase as accessories, like iPhone cases. So that one could, say, buy an Apple Watch Sport with a white sport band, and buy a Milanese Loop or one of the leather bands to make it dressier.I am no longer certain that’s going to be the case. And if it is the case, the non-Sport bands are going to be expensive — in most cases, even more expensive than the Apple Watch Sport itself.What seems clear to me now is that the various bands signify tiers within the three collections — particularly for the stainless steel Apple Watch models. Take a look at Apple’s page for the steel Watch collection , and scroll down to the bottom, where they present a scrolling carousel of “all 18 models in the collection”. From left to right:38mm with White Sport Band42mm with White Sport Band38mm with Black Sport Band42mm with Black Sport Band38mm with Black Classic Buckle42mm with Black Classic Buckle38mm with Milanese Loop38mm with Soft Pink Modern Buckle38mm with Brown Modern Buckle38mm with Midnight Blue Modern Buckle42mm with Stone Leather Loop42mm with Bright Blue Leather Loop42mm with Light Brown Leather Loop38mm with Link Bracelet38mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Link Bracelet42mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Link BraceletThings to note:The “Modern Buckle” is only available for 38mm models. The Leather Loop is only available for 42mm models. The Space Black watch is only available with a single band option: the Link Bracelet.Sport Bands are surely the least expensive. Link Bracelets, I’m almost as sure, are the most expensive. I think Apple placed these models in order from least to most expensive, going from left to right. (Including the fact that 38mm models will cost slightly less than their 42mm siblings.)Why are there both Classic Buckles and Modern Buckles? From their descriptions, it sounds like the Modern Buckle uses a better leather, and without question it has a more advanced clasp mechanism. I conclude: Modern is more expensive. They both exist because they’ll sit at different price points.Note too, that on the regular Apple Watch collection page, the Classic Buckle description states, regarding color options: “Available in black.” This, despite the same band being offered in Midnight Blue for the Edition collection.So I’m thinking the regular Apple Watch will come in at least five pricing tiers:Entry: Sport Band, black or white.Regular leather: Classic Buckle, you’ll get it in black and you’ll like it.Milanese Loop.Deluxe leather: Modern Buckle for 38mm models, Leather Loop for 42mm models. Each with a choice of three colors.Link Bracelet.You’ll pay a premium for color straps and advanced clasp mechanisms, and you’ll pay even more for the Link Bracelet.I think the spread between these tiers could be significant, ranging from, say, $700 for the entry model with the Sport Band to well over $1,000 for the Link Bracelet. I still think the average for the steel Apple Watch will be around $1,000, but depending on your strap choice, you’ll pay several hundred less or more.But wait. I would not bet against Apple bringing back the black tax. Remember the plastic MacBooks from 2006? Apple charged $150 more for the black one than the white one, even though they had nearly identical specs.Note that the silver Apple Watch Sport only has four band color choices: white, blue, green, and pink. The space gray Sport edition has only one band: black. I think Apple might charge more for both the space gray Sport model and the space black stainless steel model.Further, I don’t think any of the stainless steel bands will be available for retail purchase. They’ll sell sport bands, which you’ll be able to use on any Apple Watch, but I don’t think any of the nicer bands will be available for retail purchase. Don’t hold your breath for a space black Link Bracelet to put on your $349 Sport model. The nicer bands aren’t accessories that Apple hopes you’ll tack onto your purchase; they’re signifiers of how much you paid for your stainless steel or gold Apple Watch.Limited EditionWhich brings me to the Edition collection’s curiously thin lineup of strap choices . There are only three for each watch size, and Apple doesn’t present them side-by-side in a carousel like they do with the stainless steel models:38mm Yellow Gold with Bright Red Modern Buckle38mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band42mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band38mm Rose Gold with Rose Gray Modern Buckle42mm Yellow Gold with Black Sport Band42mm Yellow Gold with Midnight Blue Classic BuckleThat’s the order in which the six models appear on Apple’s page. It almost certainly does not correspond to price.Things to note: None of these leather colors are available in the standard Apple Watch lineup. These are not regular Sport Bands — they have gold clasps. None of them have metal bands.These are (I think) $10,000+ watches, but half of them come with rubber sport bands that are nearly indistinguishable from the bands on the $349 Sport collection.Glaringly omitted is a gold Link Bracelet. I’d place a side bet Apple withheld it in September, and will unveil it as a surprise option at the event they’ll hold before releasing the watches. If you’re going to go gold, go gold. Some people buy a gold watch simply because they like it. Others buy a gold watch because they want everyone to know they wear a gold watch. The latter group will gladly pay $20,000 for a watch with gold band.Perhaps I’m biased by my personal taste in watch bands, but at the hands-on event in September, the Link Bracelet was my favorite by far, followed by the Milanese Loop. It seems downright ludicrous to me to charge significantly more for the Edition models and not offer the best of the bands. Note too that among the Edition combinations Apple currently lists, there is but a single 42mm model with something other than a rubber Sport Band — the Midnight Blue Classic Buckle. Further, as stated above, I think the Classic Buckle is the low-end leather strap. I’m guessing Apple will offer Edition models with gold Link Bracelets for $20,000, and perhaps Milanese Loops for $15,000 and a Leather Loop for around $12,500.Look at the Watch IndustryDon’t try to guess the price of the Edition models based on the amount of gold they contain. I did it this week , but it’s the wrong way to look at this. It doesn’t matter if the gold in an Apple Watch Edition model is “only” worth $1,000 or $1,500 or whatever. The gold in a Rolex is only worth that, too — and their gold watches sell for $20,000 and more, for the exact same movements in their $6,000 stainless steel models. The value of a gold watch is only tangentially related to the number of ounces of gold it contains. And Edition isn’t just made of 18-karat gold — it’s made of the best 18-karat gold in the world. (I don’t know that for a fact — I don’t know anything about gold — I’m just saying what Apple is saying.)Apple Watch Edition is not a tech product, so don’t try to price it like one.Apple Watch Edition is a luxury wrist watch. Apple’s ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless. They’re not entering the market against Rolex, Omega, and the rest of the Swiss luxury watch establishment with disruptive prices. They’re entering the market against those companies going head-to-head on pricing, with disruptive (they think) features.Again I point you to someone from the watch world, Grail Watch’s Stephen Foskett, who points out that gold watches typically cost $10-15,000 more than the same watch in stainless steel — and tens of thousands more if they come with a gold bracelet. Even if I’m wrong about Apple having gold Link Bracelets lying in wait as an April surprise, I don’t think a $10,000 starting price for Apple Watch Edition is even a step out of line for the watch industry. 1Will it work? Will people actually buy these? I have no idea. But I think Apple thinks it’s going to work.At prices like these, an Apple Watch Edition is not an accessory for your iPhone — your iPhone is an accessory for your Apple Watch Edition. ↩︎Previous:	2015/02/20

The reports say that the size of the display is close to the length of a few small balconies and that Apple Retail Senior Vice President Angela Ahrendts has been directing the construction of the booth at retailer Galeries Lafayette on Champs Elysees. While these claims for France are still unconfirmed, sources have told us that Apple is considering constructing dedicated Apple Watch retail stores in the future if demand deems such outlets necessary…These dedicated stores could be stores within larger high-end retailers, similar to how Macs are sold at Best Buy, or smaller-scale Apple Stores that sit on their own to sell Apple Watches. It is unclear when these dedicated stores will debut, if ever, but Apple has already begun work on transforming its existing stores to sell the Apple Watch. Sources say that Apple is currently installing dedicated safes inside of its stores to house the pricier Apple Watch Edition models prior to sale in addition to special weight scales to determine the amount of gold in individual Apple Watch units. Stores have also begun stocking up on special cleaning wipes to clean Apple Watch store models in between hands-on demonstrations for customers.Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the Apple Watch will begin shipping by April .Update: Apple is reportedly opening up another pop up shop in London Selfridges pictured below in their famous “Wonder Room” with hires being transferred from local Apple Stores to the central London location.	2015/02/19

Only 16% expect the gold Apple Watch Edition to cost between $5000-$10,000, and 3.8% expect a price tag over $10,000. The biggest group at 29.68% expect the gold model to cost between $1500-$2500. But how much will the gold Apple Watch really cost?The best 4K & 5K displays for MacIt depends on how much gold, in terms of weight, is actually in the Apple Watch. Apple itself described the model as solid 18-karat gold, but we still don’t know for sure.We have at least an estimate, however, with Greg Koenig ( via Forbes ) creating a 3D render of the Apple Watch (above) and estimating around 29.16g, or approximately $1200, worth of gold. Factor in everything else included in manufacturing the watch and Apple’s usual markup and Koenig thinks the watch won’t come in below $5000. Compare that with the hint of a price point close to the entry-level $4000 Mac Pro from the WSJ in recent weeks.We’ll have to wait to know for sure how Apple decides to price the device (like an iPhone + gold or like a traditional, high-end timepiece), but it appears most consumers are expecting (or at least hoping) for the former. Our poll included nearly 10,000 votes.Guides	2015/02/19

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-ship-20-million-Watches	Claim: Apple will sell 20 million Watches in 2015	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Sales', 'Ben Wood', 'CSS Insight']	http://www.ccsinsight.com/	http://www.ccsinsight.com/press/company-news/2137-wearables-market-2015-is-year-that-will-make-or-break-the-smartwatch	2015/02/17	"17 February 2015: Sales of wearables will grow from 29 million in 2014 to 172 million in 2018, with a spike in 2015. The most popular devices will be smartwatches and fitness trackers. This is according to CCS Insight's latest global wearables forecast. The next 12 months will be a transformative year for the wearables market thanks to the arrival of the Apple Watch. This highly anticipated smartwatch will create a frenzy of demand, catapulting it almost instantaneously to be the most successful smartwatch ever. CCS Insight expects Apple to employ its full marketing arsenal and the power of its brand to create another must-have status symbol. CCS Insight projects Apple will account for a quarter of the wearables market in 2015, selling around 20 million Apple Watches by the end of the year. This is equivalent to about 7% of those who own a compatible iPhone at the time of the product's launch. The current love affair affluent US consumers have with the iPhone guarantees a strong start for the Apple Watch in its home market. However, if sales of the Apple Watch fail to meet expectations it could hurt the whole smartwatch market. Last year confirmed that North America will remain the biggest market for wearables in the near term. This region accounted for more than half of global sales in 2014 and that momentum continues in 2015. Commenting, Ben Wood, CCS Insight's Chief of Research, stated ""The Apple Watch will be instrumental in taking the wearables market to the next level of growth. If successful, it'll create a rising tide that will lift the whole market."" CCS Insight's consumer surveys indicate extremely high levels of awareness of wearable devices, but the challenge is translating this into sales. Wood continues, ""People without an iPhone will still have a huge choice of alternative wearables. If the Apple Watch performs as well as expected, its halo effect will result in a sales bonanza in the second half of 2015, with record-breaking shipments in the important fourth quarter."" While the Apple Watch will be in the spotlight this year, fitness bands from companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone will continue to dominate the wearables market, building on their explosive growth in 2014. CCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili observes, ""We expect sales of fitness and activity devices to double in 2015 to 40 million units. In contrast to many other commentators, we don't believe smartwatches will dent sales of fitness products in the short term. Smart fitness devices do one thing and do it well: they measure activity with the goal of improving owners' well-being. This, combined with lower retail prices, longer battery life and a strong head start in terms of adoption, suggests that these devices will outperform smartwatches for several years to come."" Action cameras are a much-forgotten part of the wearables market. They were a central product in the market's early stages and remained the second-biggest category in 2014. Almost 6 million units were sold worldwide in 2014, buoyed by the success of market leader GoPro. Although CCS Insight predicts continued growth in the wearable camera segment boosted by more-affordable and capable products, the near-universal access to cameras on smartphones will limit total sales. Beyond the well-known brands and types of wearable device, CCS Insight has observed a steady flow of weird and wonderful new products that it defines as the ""long tail"" of wearables. This category includes smart clothing, intelligent shoes and insoles, jewellery, adhesive sensors and patches, and even sex toys. Many of these devices are developed as crowd-funded projects and few will succeed. They underline the fact that the wearables market is still in its early stages and despite the explosive growth it will be dwarfed by the 1.5 billion smartphone shipments that CCS Insight forecasts in 2015.

http://www.emergent.info/smaller-Apple-Watch-edition-price	Claim: The smaller gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $7,999 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	http://grail-watch.com/	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/16	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

But none of those technologies made it into the much-anticipated Apple Watch, due in April. Some didn’t work reliably. Others proved too complex. And still others could have prompted unwanted regulatory oversight, these people said.	2015/02/17

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-straps-available-at-launch	Claim: Apple have different Watch bands for sale at launch	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Accessories', 'Jordan Kahn']	http://9to5mac.com/	http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/20/apple-watch-straps-accessories-available-separately/	2015/02/15	RedditDespite speculation to the contrary, Apple does in fact plan to sell an array of bands as separate accessories for the Apple Watch at launch, according to sources. So far Apple has only shown the Watch in pre-assembled collections, which reduces their potential for customization, but our sources say that Apple’s retail outlets will be stocked on day one with individual straps so customers can easily mix and match the looks of their Watches.While Apple has hinted at millions of combinations of Apple Watch when considering the various watch faces and interchangeable strap combos, up until now we’ve not had confirmation that straps would be available to purchase separately alongside the Apple Watch at launch.The best 4K & 5K displays for MacWhat we know about the Apple Watch lineup so far from Apple is that it will come in three models— Apple Watch, Sport, and Edition— with each of those models offering a selection of the total 6 straps Apple has shown so far on the 38mm size, 42mm size, or both. Some of the straps Apple shows on its website , such as the Modern Buckle and Leather Loop— will be limited to either the 38mm or 42mm models in select colors for the Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Edition. It’s unclear Apple’s exact motivation in limiting certain watch straps to either the 38mm and 42mm options in the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition lineups. The Apple Watch Sport line offers all strap options and colors for both sizes, according to Apple’s site. However, it’s possible that some of the straps Apple shows as limited to either the 38mm or 42mm sizes will become available to purchase for the other size separately. Some straps and bracelets might make more sense to offer as standalone accessories. Not offering straps for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition could be something Apple does strategically to increase the exclusivity of those models that many expect to sell as high-end fashion items with matching price tags.There’s no confirmation on what straps Apple will make available to purchase separately at launch or if the options will reflect all variations of the device currently shown on Apple’s website. It’s of course also possible, and quite likely, that Apple will offer straps beyond the designs it’s outed so far. Guides	2015/02/20
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-display	Claim: Apple will create special 'store-within-a-store spaces' for the Apple Watch Edition	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	http://grail-watch.com/	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/15	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/ios8-reset-bug	"Claim: 'Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8 deletes iWork files"	unverified	[]	http://www.macrumors.com/	http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/	2014/09/30	"It appears that there may be a serious bug with the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive. Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud. In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac. There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by ""Reset All Settings"" in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A Mavericks user was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via Time Machine. One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data. Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released. Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive. Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine.

http://www.emergent.info/beats-shutdown	Claim: Apple will shutdown Beats Music	unverified	[]	http://techcrunch.com/	http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/	2014/09/22	Apple will discontinue the streaming music service Beats Music it acquired in May, according to five sources, including several prominent employees at Apple and Beats. Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It’s not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre’s music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand. [Update: Apple has told TechCrunch that our report of Beats being shut down “is not true”, but sources familiar with the situation tell Re/code that Apple “may, however, modify [Beats Music] over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand.” This aligns with what my sources said, which is that the Beats Music brand will be shut down, but that it’s unclear what Apple wants to do in streaming music. It seems quite possible that the Beats Music product could be rolled into iTunes rather than being ‘shuttered’, but that’s semantics. Apple’s response really depends on the interpretation of “shut down”. If Apple rolls Beats Music into iTunes and removes the dedicated Beats Music app from the App Store, I would call that being shut down. Beats Music itself came from a “rebranding” aka shutdown of the MOG music streaming service it acquired. The fact that the new iPhones did not come pre-installed with Beats Music, while several other Apple apps came loaded on the 6 and 6 Plus, should have been a red flag. There was also nothing said about Beats Music during the Apple Watch reveal, even though the service’s radio and fire-and-forget playlists could work well on a wearable. In August, Beats Music was being advertised to new users on iOS 7, yet the only time Beats Music got an off-hand mention at the September launch event was when Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new U2 album would be available there. Instead of Beats Music, the Apple Watch features a unannounced music app [Update: Remote app] with a blue play button (top right in the photo below) that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo. Considering Apple’s penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music’s CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning he’s already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music. Shutting down Beats Music also meshes with reports that the Beats acquisition was mostly about getting Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre’s talent on board, and picking up the headphone business, not about streaming music. Having Beats as a side brand in music accessories flows naturally, but seems clumsy when it comes to software. We’ve contacted Apple with a request for comment on its plans for Beat Music. Beats has recently launched an Apple TV channel and released a “Listen Now” integration with Shazam, but both seem like they could have been in the pipeline directly. The move will let Apple focus on its flagship music product with its enormous 800 million user base and treasure trove of over 400 million stored credit cards. Beats Music’s growth has likely been hampered by its late start compared to competitors like Spotify, Rdio, Google Music, and Pandora. Though its strategy was to differentiate itself through curated playlists and mood-based radio, those failed to capture the attention of mainstream listeners. Thanks to seven-day free trials and multi-month demos through AT&T, 5 million people had tried Beats by May, but only 250,000 had signed up for a paid subscription. That’s pretty small compared to the 10 million paid subscribers and 40 million total listeners on Spotify, and 76.4 million active listeners on Pandora. Yet stacked up against the iTunes userbase, Beats Music is just a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple certainly didn’t hesitate to shut down music streaming service Lala after acquiring it. The big question is what will Apple do with streaming music. Buying Beats Music may still assist Apple hear through talent, technology, and industry relationships even without the Beats Music brand. One source said Apple may roll streaming into iTunes. This could be the most logical strategy for Apple if it can find a way to keep its traditional music file download customers happy while opening its catalogue to streaming for early adopters who want to listen from the cloud. Perhaps rather than just buy buttons, there could be play buttons in iTunes, too. Another source said Apple plans to make some significant music announcement in the first half of next year. Apple is in the tricky position of trying to smoothly transition its music business from the download to the streaming era. Digital music sales fell 13.3 percent in 2013, while U.S. streaming grew 32 percent. With streaming eating downloads, Apple will have to make a shift or at least accomodate streaming. But it doesn’t just want to ditch sales overnight. 1.26 billion songs and 117.6 million albums were sold online in 2013, providing vital capital to the music industry. Forcing users across the chasm from iTunes to Beats Music seems precarious, especially with on-demand streaming competitors like Spotify and Google Music looking to pounce on potential customers. It’s doubtful that Apple would abandon its iTunes brand after 13 years of success just because Beats joined the family. Evolving a unified Apple music service sounds a lot better than having two playing out of sync.	2014/09/22

A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an “illegal service.” The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies./r/darknetmarketsThe Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users, This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP . The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcast’s Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under “ technical restrictions .”:use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (“PremisesLAN”), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcast’s treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht’s internet usage. Ulbricht’s legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the “Six Strikes” plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the “Six Strikes” plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.EDIT 14.9.14: Removed a sentence that was wrong. Added link.EDIT2 15.9.14: Comcast released a post Setting the Record Straight on Tor denying the above and stating: “The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.” Without explaining what is the “accurate” explanation?	2014/09/13
http://www.emergent.info/apple-path	Claim: Apple is buying Path	unverified	[]	http://pando.com/	http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/	2014/09/10	LinkedInFrom The News DeskIn a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables , and payments . But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.According to a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin’s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, “It’s almost done, if not signed already, but it’s essentially a done deal.”If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers – particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasn’t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple’s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn’t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook’s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.Apple’s re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, it’s unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apple’s one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications . It’s certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messaging platform, but it’s unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for today’s Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr— Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morin’s, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the company’s decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldn’t be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morin’s seating at today’s event and Apple’s long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years.To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didn’t have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Don’t be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back.	2014/09/10

http://www.emergent.info/apple-12-inch-Macbook-air	"Claim: Apple will launch a 12"" MacBook Air in 2015"	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'Mark Gurman']	http://9to5mac.com/	http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/	2014/01/07	RedditApple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012 .The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below:Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models.The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apple’s plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steeber ‘s rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool.The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the “MacBook Stealth” internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well:The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.As we’ve reported on multiple occasions , the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays . Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new “Space Gray” color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions.The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production . With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apple’s court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.Guides	2015/01/06

AdvertisingAs disciplinary authority, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu directed dismissal from service of Executive Engineer (Electrical), A K Verma, after the charge of wilful absence from duty against him was proven in an inquiry set up to probe the matter.A senior ministry official said that Verma, who had joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980, went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter.Verma went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work.

http://www.emergent.info/there-can-only-be-one-kim-jong-un	Claim: North Korea issued a directive that anyone with the name Kim Jong Un must change it	unverified	['Kim Jong Un', 'North Korea']	http://www.theguardian.com/	http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/03/kim-jong-un-north-korea-name-ban	2014/12/04	Kim Jong-unNorth Korea directive reveals apparent ban on sharing Kim Jong-un’s nameOfficials ordered to make citizens named after leader change their names, according to document obtained by South Korean TVAgence France-Presse in SeoulWed 3 Dec 2014 09.06 GMTFirst published on Wed 3 Dec 2014 08.06 GMTShare via EmailThis article is over 4 years oldThe document said officials were directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un. Photograph: Kcna/ReutersA year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it – maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive state’s ruling Kim dynasty, a report said.An internal state document obtained by South Korea’s KBS TV station contains an “administrative order” from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his father’s successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it added.The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul’s unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.“Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” the official said.The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un,” Park, who defected in 2008, said.Topics	2014/12/03
http://www.emergent.info/Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi-wife-son-arrested	Claim: A wife and child of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were detainted in Lebanon	unverified	['Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi', 'ISIS']	http://www.theguardian.com/	http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/al-baghdadi-wife-son-arrest-lebanon-fake-passport	2014/12/03	Wife and child of Islamic State leader Baghdadi held in LebanonArrest is described as ‘high-value catch’ and reportedly follows information provided by western intelligence agenciesTue 2 Dec 2014 18.11 GMTFirst published on Tue 2 Dec 2014 08.58 GMTThis article is over 4 years oldA man said to be Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi at a mosque in Mosul, Iraq. Photograph: Reuters TVThe Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border.The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight.Lebanese security officials described the woman as a “high-value catch” and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadi’s DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004.The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports.Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian.“It is close to impossible that she would have operational details,” said an Iraqi intelligence officer. “But she could still be useful on things like locations.”Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraq’s north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (£6.4m) bounty on Baghdadi’s head.Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanon’s military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut.The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria , according to media reports at the time.The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border.Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraq’s central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew.Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video’s authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that “the Dane is doing better.”Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria.Topics	2014/12/02

According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage.Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websites reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli of dual nationality in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

We dont have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious1NextIraqi forces drive ISIS out of Baiji and begin siege of its...ISIS leaders behind beheadings, stonings and the murder of...Share this articleShareThe Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports. A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.But until now, Jihadi Johns presence at the meeting has not emerged.It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present. Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, leftAccording to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was the one who slaughtered the journalists.It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosques loudspeakers, appealing for the towns residents to donate blood at the hospital.Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regimes 17th Division and 93rd Brigade. Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal Jihadi John has become one of the worlds most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS wilayat, or province.IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria. The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, picturedThe source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere.The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturdays attack.The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leaders house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property. It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.He said: A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.Also dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document.	2014/11/15

Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria’s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.“He’s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,” the diplomat said. “It’s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.“But we’ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we’re taking this with a little salt.”Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.“This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren’t there yet,” said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. “Until every girl is released negotiations must continue.“We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.”Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis.The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group’s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda’s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria’s volatile “Middle Belt”, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.	2014/10/17
http://www.emergent.info/isis-fighter-jets	Claim: ISIS fighters are being trained to fly three captured fighter jets	unverified	[]	http://www.reuters.com/	http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/us-mideast-crisis-jets-idUSKCN0I60TM20141017	2014/10/17	BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air. The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria. U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes. “They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,” Abdulrahman said. “People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,” he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border. Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report. It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military. U.S. “We’re not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,” U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State. General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. “We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,” he told a Pentagon news briefing. Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats. The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.	2014/10/17

The second militant was allegedly killed for “dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen”.The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising.He told The Independent: “Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement.ShapeIsis fighters in Kobani (2014): Civilians flee as militants enter Syria-Turkey borderShow all 22Isis fighters in Kobani (2014): Civilians flee as militants enter Syria-Turkey border1/22 Syria-Turkey borderMourners gathered to bury three Kurdish fighters from Kobani2/22 Syria-Turkey borderAn explosion rocks the Syrian city of Kobani during a reported suicide car bomb attack by IsisGetty3/22 Syria-Turkey borderThe US and Turkey have stepped up support for Kurdish fighters defending Kobani against Isis but it is still feared the town may fall;

http://www.emergent.info/kim-jong-un-hurt-leg	Claim: Kim Jong Un hurt his leg during military exercises	unverified	[]	http://www.reuters.com/	http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/09/us-northkorea-kim-idUSKCN0HY09T20141009	2014/10/09	October 9, 2014 / 4:34 AM / 4 years agoNorth Korea leader Kim is still in charge, has leg injury: sourceBenjamin Kang Lim , James Pearson5 Min ReadBEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North’s leadership said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old’s health and grip on power.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (4th R) visits the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun to pay tribute to founding President Kim Il Sung and former leader Kim Jong Il to mark the 61st anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War, in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 27, 2014. REUTERS/KCNANorth Korea’s state media, which usually chronicles Kim’s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3, and Kim was absent from early state media coverage of a major political anniversary on Friday.In the previous two years, Kim marked the anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s Workers’ Party with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.Last year, that visit was covered about four hours later by the state’s KCNA news agency, and by the daily Rodong Sinmun newspaper. As of about 8 a.m. (7.00 p.m. EDT) on Friday, there was no KCNA report of an event at the mausoleum. Friday’s Rodong Sinmun could not yet be seen on its website.Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, did not always attend the Oct. 10 memorial event when he was in power.The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said on Thursday that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.“He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,” the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,” the source said.Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with important officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.“Kim Jong Un is in total control,” said the source.Kim’s absence from public view is fuelling speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle.“The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,” said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.NOT KIM’S FIRST ABSENCENorth Korean officials have denied that Kim’s public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.Speculation that Kim’s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean television report late last month that said he was suffering from “discomfort”.Some North Korea watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un’s health said rumors of a coup were “rubbish”.“It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,” said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.However, Kim’s name has not disappeared from state propaganda.Thursday’s edition of the Rodong Sinmun carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked “the Marshal” for his support during the competition.Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.“Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,” he said.Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan	2014/10/09

How long until boots are forced to be on the ground?A Republican congressman claimed Tuesday that ""at least 10"" Islamic State ""fighters"" have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, though an administration official denied it.Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns.""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.""Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim.""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol.""""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change.""Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh.The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told.Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border.""At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border.Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.""The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization.""FoxNews.com's Judson Berger and Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.Trending in Politics"	2014/10/08

In this image taken at the weekend, peshmerga forces are seen holding a post in the strategic Jalawla area, considered a gateway to the city Peshmerga fighters hold a position at a post in the strategic Jalawla area near Baghdad during a battle with Islamic State militants at the weekend. The location is considered a gateway to the Iraqi capital Location: The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad. But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbsReports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad.

Approaching: Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White Fear: Canon Andrew White, is the vicar of Baghdad's St George's Church - the only Anglican church in Iraq. Earlier Canon White had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the city No protection: Canon Andrew White later updated his Facebook page questioning the ability of the Iraqi Army FEMALE PILOT LEADS FIRST SORTIE A female fighter pilot led Britain's first combat mission against Islamic State.The woman, who has not been named, flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist-held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday.Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, she is believed to be a weapons systems operator.She sits in the jet's rear seat and fires the aircraft's Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs.The airwoman, who serves with II (AC) Squadron, flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues.A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday but despite having now sent out jets five times, they again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic StateIt came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had like on Saturday failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.The mobile refineries generate up to 1.2million a day for the militants. On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the countryMeanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action. The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action. President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves' Militants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq KEY PARTNERS IN THE COALITION AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.UNITED STATESThe U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.GULF STATESSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.JORDANJordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.EGYPTEgypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.ISRAELIsrael is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.BRITAINBritain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.FRANCEFrance has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.AUSTRALIAAn Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops most of them air force personnel are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.BELGIUMSix F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.DENMARKDenmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.CANADACanada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.GERMANYGermany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.GREECEGreece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.GEORGIAGeorgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.HUNGARYHungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.ROMANIAPrime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.POLANDPoland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat.	2014/09/29

http://www.emergent.info/time-capsule-unearthed	Claim: A 113-year-old time capsule was found hidden inside a lion statue in Boston	true	['Boston']	https://www.bostonherald.com/	https://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2014/12/mfa_expert_digs_out_state_house_time_capsule	2014/12/13	A time capsule officials say was buried in 1795 with relics placed inside by American patriots Sam Adams and Paul Revere was unearthed last night at the State House. Workers from the Museum of Fine Arts yesterday carefully chipped at a plaster seal that encased the capsule inside a granite cornerstone. The cornerstone had been removed and placed on blocks. Preservationist Pamela Hatchfield lay on her back under the suspended stone using a hammer and chisel to remove the plaster. “The plaster is incredibly hard and in very good shape after all of this time so it’s been difficult to get it out,” said Hatchfield, head of objects conservation at the MFA. The capsule will be X-rayed Sunday before it’s opened. Based on records, the capsule likely contains coins that date between 1652 and 1855, an engraved silver plate, newspapers, and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records. Contents were added to the capsule in 1885 after a renovation project led to the capsule’s initial discovery.	2014/12/12

http://www.emergent.info/elon-university-freshman-ban	Claim: Elon University has banned use of the term 'freshman'	false	['Elon University', 'Freshman', 'University']	http://www.thecollegefix.com/	http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/20172/	2014/11/23	Share this article: The College Fix on Facebook The College Fix on Twitter The College Fix on Youtube Share on EmailOFFICIAL: Celebrates wider range of identities and expressions, protects young women from sexual violenceELON, N.C. – Elon University has dropped the term “freshman” from its vocabulary and replaced it with “first-year,” a move made official this fall and implemented in everything from its website to orientation workshops.The change at the small, private liberal arts college in North Carolina was done to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and ensure the campus did not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students, campus officials said in interviews with The College Fix.Leigh-Anne Royster , director of Elon’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing,” said in an email to The College Fix that she has been told by some that they believe the term “freshman” is outdated, and that replacing “freshman” with “first year” is a “celebration of diversity.”Royster stated the word “freshman” naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus. She said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as “freshman.” With that, Royster stated “freshman” may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students, causing them to be targets.“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Royster said. “Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way.”Royster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at Elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender.“Using language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward,” she said. “Moving away from language, including pronouns, that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions.”At this semester’s student orientation leader training, administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called “first-years.” No public announcement was made regarding this change — administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news.Elon sophomore Alaina Schukraft, an orientation leader, told The Fix that each time an orientation leader said “freshman” in training, he or she was immediately corrected.“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” Schukraft said. “They were very adamant about using the correct terminology and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.”But when the new wording was rolled out, not all incoming students were comfortable with this change. Schukraft said multiple incoming students approached her saying they were more comfortable with the term “freshman.”But Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, said in an email to The College Fix that the change improves the campus environment.Zaiser said administrators believe the change keeps with Elon’s core values, and is a more appropriate description for new students. He added some believe “freshmen” is a “sexist” term, and Elon is attempting to move away from gendered stereotypes.“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an email to The College Fix. “ ‘Freshman’ isn’t necessarily wrong, but it’s not completely applicable to Elon’s entire population, which includes internationals, transfers, spring admits, along with traditional students beginning their first year on a college campus.”College Fix contributor Diana Stancy is a student at Elon University and president of the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) chapter at Elon.IMAGE: Facebook screenshotRead More	2014/11/19
http://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys InfectedPosted onby Daily Buzz LiveTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.	2014/11/10
http://www.emergent.info/ny-marijuana-tickets	Claim: New York Police will start issuing tickets, rather than make arrests, for small amounts of marijuana	true	['Marijuana', 'NYC', 'Police']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/nyregion/in-shift-police-dept-to-stop-low-level-marijuana-arrests-officials-say.html?_r=0	2014/11/10	Nov. 10, 2014A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the city’s five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorney’s offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayor’s plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.Since July, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn.Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review.ImagePolice Commissioner William J. BrattonCreditMichael Appleton for The New York Times“In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,” Mr. Thompson said. “By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”Another possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the city’s lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics.Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were “put through the system,” meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Department’s crime-fighting strategies . During the Bloomberg administration, the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets.ImageKenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney.CreditBebeto Matthews/Associated PressIn 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime. But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in “public view.” In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly, issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said.While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the department’s marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve.Yet Mr. de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform. That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Since then, the departures of the department’s top Hispanic official and its highest-ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr. de Blasio’s oversight of the police.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In City, Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest.

http://www.emergent.info/fort-carson-lockdown	Claim: Fort Carson is locked down because of a missing nuclear weapon	false	[]	http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/	http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1809.htm	2014/10/14	"By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers The Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) is reporting today that President Putins order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is intensely/directly related to a missing, and believed stolen, low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson , Colorado, which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs.According to the SVR, the atomic weapon missing fromFortCarsonhas been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 845.82 mm (33.3 inches) long.This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models, Mod 0 and Mod 1, which weighed 53.5 and 58 kg (118 and 128 pounds) respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0.072 kiloton (72 tons of TNT).Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been retired by 1992, this report says, the SVR has long noted their continued use for training by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex, all of whom are located in El Paso County , Colorado.The specificUSweapons platform designed to fire the W48, this report notes, is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System [3rd photo left] which is currently operated by forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell disappeared, this report continues, the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center , in California, which will span much of November, after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide .US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are nonexistent, this report further notes, other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a  total lockdown  as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost "" sensitive item "", a term they use that refers to gear including weapons, ammunition and night vision goggles - items that cause high-level concern when missing.These media reports further report that whatever is missing, it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carson's gates yesterday and their spokesman stating: As part of random searches at the gate, we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation.Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell, SVR intelligence analysts in this report state, is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named nukes on the loose and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic dirty bomb that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis.Londons Telegraph News Service in their report on this nukes on the loose war game further noted:David Cameron joined Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a ""nukes on the loose"" war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack. The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.Of equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.In his warning Dr. Roberts stated: Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as Whats the good of nuclear weapons if you cant use them.With the suicidal tendencies of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russias near record de-Dollarization efforts , when coupled with the secret deal between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria , point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapse and all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath .including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.October 12, 2014 © EU and US all rights reserved.

http://www.emergent.info/Foley-ransom	Claim: The US threatened to prosecute the family of slain journalist James Foley	unverified	[]	http://abcnews.go.com/	http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963&singlePage=true	2014/09/23	"Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James FoleyNicole Tung/AP PhotoIn this Nov. 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows missing journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria.Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foley’s brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.“It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust… that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,” Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Digital GlobeThis satellite photo shows a compound on the Euphrates River just south of Raqqah, Syria where ISIS hostages, including James Foley, were believed to have been held in the Spring of 2014 based on descriptions by former hostages.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didn’t seem like anything was being done.“But we’re not politicians, we’re not government people, we don’t know,” she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family “had no idea” because the government didn’t tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family “had to beg” the government for information on their son.“We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level… They didn’t have time for us,” she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters he’s “not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.”“It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,” Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foley’s situation to the Justice Department .Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was “really taken aback [and] surprised” by Foley’s allegations. “I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,” Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families “understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.”“But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,” Harf said.Obtained by ABC NewsA screengrab from a video posted online appears to show American journalist James Foley shortly before he is killed by a masked captor.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. government’s treatment of the families of hostages, “As Americans, we can do better.”"	2014/09/12
