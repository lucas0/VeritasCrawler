Content: Facebook has been flush with stories about the National Football League since President Donald Trump called on team owners to fire any player who “disrespects our flag” by making political demonstrations on the field during the national anthem.The president’s appeal drew criticism from the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell — who called for a “sense of unity” — and various teams and players, who mostly either locked arms, took a knee or stayed off the field as the anthem played prior to games on Sept. 24 and 25.However, several of the stories that have been circulated widely, and flagged as potentially fake news on Facebook, are not true.Claim: The NFL fined Steelers players who weren’t on the sidelines for the anthem.Flagged on: The Last Line of Defense, World News, The Trumppers and others.More than a dozen websites posted a bogus story claiming the league fined the Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million for every player who wasn’t present for the national anthem.Prior to the game against the Chicago Bears, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin announced that his team would remain off the field for the anthem so that players wouldn’t have to decide whether to stand or take a knee.“It was a bad decision,” says the story that originated at thelastlineofdefense.org. “NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who donated to Donald Trump’s election campaign, announced shortly after the game began that every player who ‘protested’ the National Anthem and showed ‘immense disrespect to our nation’ would be fined a cool million dollars.”However, no such fine has been imposed, Brian McCarthy, vice president for corporate communications at the NFL, confirmed to FactCheck.org. Goodell also didn’t contribute to Trump’s presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.The story was completely fabricated.A disclaimer on the thelastlineofdefense.org says: “America’s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist.”
